David Slocum, PhD, is an executive coach whose clients include senior leaders and business owners in industries ranging from big tech, marketing and media to business intelligence and strategic consulting. During the coronavirus lockdown, David found that what defined his coaching has continued to be important as leaders throughout much of Europe and North America begin the slow process of defining their next normal. Here, David discusses how friction can be a positive and even useful for leaders. -- The OGL Team
Frictionhas become an increasingly popular term of art in business management over the past few years. The predominant usage casts friction in negative terms, as an impediment to smoothly and rapidly operating systems or processes – that is, as a time-wasting or resource-draining obstacle to be reduced or eliminated. Less frequently, friction appears as constructive, slowly down processes or decisions, and giving helpful pause to individuals and groups alike. The following post picks up especially on that latter, underappreciated way of thinking more positively about friction at work and in the world. The aim here is to emphasize the value to leaders and all of us of being able to differentiate problematic and productive friction and respond appropriately.
One conspicuous reason for the prevalence of viewing friction negatively has been the proliferation of technologies for which ever-increasing speed and continuing operation are priorities. As researchers likeAdam AlterandNir Eyalhave demonstrated, technology companies make enormous investments in creating products – devices, applications, entertainment – designed to prevent users from stopping their interactions with smartphones and tablets, video games, and streaming services. In fact, Alter argues that the product designs can go so far as to make users susceptible to behavioral addiction. Continuous positive feedback loops and unpredictable rewards, simulated connectivity, number-based comparisons, always-on notification systems, and automatic refreshing and reloading are just a few of the features that help to remove reasons to stop using, playing, or watching.
Marketers and sellers have likewise increasingly sought to streamline processes for customers and providing them a seamless customer journey. Better understanding and re-designing customer experience have become more and more central to marketers’ communication and branding activities. Brian Halligan, the CEO of HubSpot, a leading maker of marketing, sales, and service, software, puts it simply: “Dollars flow where the friction is low.” Instant booking on Airbnb and 1-click buying on Amazon, like comparable options at Instacart, Uber, and other online vendors, remove what is often the biggest source of friction in online purchases, the checkout process. How valuable is it? Recognizing its potential importance in converting sales, Amazon filed a patent for 1-click in 1997. In their 2017 book,Friction, marketers Jeff Rosenblum and Jordan Berg wrote about the historical sea change that requires the creation of what they call “a passion brand…that focuses on behaviors over messaging.”
User behavior and customer experiences and journeys are bases for discussing friction that may be more familiar to a general public whose lives have rapidly become shaped by digital technologies, interactions, and commerce. Yet the topic is broader. In 2019, speaker and consultant Roger Dooley published a book, also entitled,Friction, that catalogued difficulties, real and perceived, in nearly every part of life. From retail, transportation, and technology to decision-making, habit-changing, and simplifying bureaucratic organizations, Dooley finds friction and offers pragmatic approaches to reducing or removing it. He captures his objective in a “fundamental law of friction”: “Decreasing friction increases action.” In other words, friction is defined by its (inverse) relationship to action. Friction wastes time and effort, produces pointless meetings, and produces irksome red tape.
For many leaders, such an all-encompassing focus on friction may seem merely an updating and extension of a longstanding way of seeing organizational and commercial challenges. No less a source that eventual Nobel Laureate Ronald Coase, in his epochal essay, “The Nature of the Firm,” argued in 1937 that a driving reason for business firms to organize and build up activities in-house was to minimizetransaction costs– friction – with suppliers, competitors, and others outside. For decades after, financial, engineering, and operations sought to remove friction from organizational and market processes. By the 1990s, amidst the techno-optimism of the dot.com boom and the promise of a “wired world,” T.G. Lewis went so far as to wroteThe Friction-Free Economy, which “assumes zero production and distribution costs, no competitors, and the availability of unlimited resources.”
Recently, Bob Sutton, a Stanford Graduate School of Business professor, launched with his colleague, Haragreeva Rao, “The Friction Project,” an online resource hub and podcast series, dedicated to “building organizations that make the right things easy to do and don’t drive people crazy.” As the majority of articles, cases, and podcast episodes make plain, a guiding priority for the project is a familiar one: the elimination of bottlenecks, rules, and processes that are impediments or obstacles to more efficient and less frustrating work. In other words, friction here is till mainly a problem to be reduced, resolved or eliminated. To his credit, Sutton highlights the human toll of friction in organizations and, besides lessening workers’ frustration and fatigue, he emphasizes how reducing friction can increase human dignity.
The “messy multi-pronged mission” of the project, Sutton goes on, is “to understand the causes and cures for destructive organizational friction–and when it is wise to make things harder to do.” Those final, appended words are crucial. Sutton is an exceptional management researcher and he clearly understands that some kinds of friction can be useful and beneficial. Yet there’s little in the project (at least so far) that substantiates this important qualifier. An illuminating exception isthe case of Waze, the GPS navigation software producer. In 2010, CEO Noam Bardin paused product development and froze hiring for six weeks in order to determine why customers would purchase the navigation app and stop using it shortly thereafter. Having identified customer difficulties and “pain points,” the company released new iterations of the product every month for six months. Waze both gained and retained more customers and, in 2013, they were acquired by Google.
We might stipulate that the identification and removal or elimination of friction points remains a vital imperative for many leaders. Yet is also crucial to recognize instances like occurred at Waze in which friction – the hindering or delaying of given operations or processes – should be embraced (at least temporarily). The challenge for leaders is to distinguish which friction to reduce and which to accept. In many situations, as we’ll see, opportunities exist to find a sweet spot between the two responses that allows individual, teams and companies to be more human, creative, and even productive. Here is a range of illustrations of how friction – in the form of delay, complication, and interaction – can be advantageous for leaders and businesses.
1. Thinking, Without and With Friction
Perhaps the most familiar example of useful friction, at least for those who think about thinking and decision-making, comes from Nobel Laureate Daniel Kahneman. His characterization of how humans form thoughts, frame experiences, and shape decisions relies on a dichotomy betweentwo modes of thought. While ‘System 1’ is fast, reactive, and often emotional, ‘System 2’ is slower, reflective, more logical. Importantly, Kahneman insists that the systems remain interdependent, with both being necessary to the way we think, reason, and experience the world. System 2 pauses over the responses of System 1, consciously determining the appropriateness of its rapid and instinctive formation of thoughts and connections. That deliberatefrictionin what would otherwise be an automatic process of thought-formation and decision-making creates awareness of our biases, invokes our memories, and allows us to consider alternatives.
2. Decisions and Habits
James Clear’s excellentAtomic Habitsrelies on a parallel understanding of how people’s behaviors result from a combination of automatic choices and more conscious decisions. If habits are routines or behaviors done regularly, even automatically, building new ones or dropping old ones involves creating greater awareness of them, understanding the patterns and routines in one’s life, being intentional and planning changes, and then settling into the new routine or behavior. For Clear, the optimal change of habits involves moving from an automatic behavior, through awareness and deliberately re-structuring one’s life, until a new behavior itself becomes habitual and automatic. Periodic reflection and review of one’s habits are critical for recognizing specific behaviors and routines as well as determining which processes and outcomes can change. Taking time, generating awareness, and implementing changes – again, creating friction – in otherwise automatic behaviors can become the basis for positive habit changes.
3. Group Decision-making and Creativity
In the historical annals of leadership decision-making,Peter Druckerrelates a favorite anecdote about longtime General Motors CEO Alfred Sloan.
“Gentlemen, I take it we are all in complete agreement on the decision here.’ Everyone around the table nodded assent. ‘Then,’ continued Mr. Sloan, ‘I propose we postpone further discussion of this matter until the next meeting to give ourselves time to develop disagreement, and perhaps gain some understanding of what the decision is all about.”
A half-century later, inCollective Genius,her 2014 study of leading innovation, Harvard Business professor Linda Hill would point to “creative abrasion” as one of the three capabilities of organizational innovation. Her research revealed the importance of an “ability to generate ideas through discourse and debate.” Like Sloan, she recognized the centrality of friction, generated through disagreement and debate among team members, for productive and creative collaboration.
4. Biases and Diversity in Organizations and Society
The hard work of innovation requires both different ideas and diverse perspectives. Sociologists Frank Dobbin and Alexandra Kalev, of Harvard and Tel Aviv Universities (respectively), saw thatcorporate diversity programscould be improved by managers’ increased interactions with women and minorities. In her exceptional 2019 book,Biased, Stanford’s Jennifer L. Eberhardt writes more directly about the potential benefits to organizational Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion efforts of friction that generates not only awareness of their biases but a greater willingness and capacity “to think and talk frankly about race.” Eberhard goes still further to draw an explicit contemporary contrast: “Speed is the holy grail of technology. Most tech products are created with the aim of reducing friction and guiding us through a process rapidly and intuitively. But the very thing that makes technology so convenient also makes it perilous where race and safety are concerned.”
Friction can therefore stand in for various forms of resistance to the familiar, the automatic, and, in business or user processes, the efficient. Such resistance or difficulty prompts awareness and reflection and can lead to learning and innovation. This is not a novel perspective. In 2005, John Hagel III and John Seely Brown, both later of Deloitte, wrote about the potentially “productive friction” of difficult business partnerships. In that context, they picked up on Sloan’s recognition of the potentially clarifying and advantageous back-and-forth collaboration of different people. Hagel and Seely Brown also offered a memorable metaphor for how friction between people or companies becomes productive: “Weaving a Performance Fabric” takes time, misunderstandings, and mistakes in order to build mutual trust and shared meanings, “skill and will.” They conclude by calling for a more systematic understanding of performance, and especially whether individual collaborators work effectively, across diverse companies and networks.
While still generally helpful, that advice becomes more powerful when we seek to understand collaborations, process, and organizations more fully, beyond the realm of performance,per se. That is, when we prioritize and integrate the human elements of organizations, networks, and partnerships. MIT management professor Edgar Schein famously wrote, “People are the problem—they make mistakes and therefore should be designed out of the system whenever possible.” For leaders seeking to engage and understand the complexity of friction in their teams and businesses, the converse is also true: humanity is the great differentiator. When people introduce friction, as they invariably will, systems can be made more efficient – or they can be improved, lessons can be learned, and innovation can be pursued.
