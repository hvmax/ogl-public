Two Simple Questions to Greatly Impress a Client or a Boss
Imagine you're sitting across from a client or your boss. The conversation has been productive, ideas have flowed, and you're nearing the conclusion. You feel the urge to summarize what was said, but then your mind flashes to two simple questions that could set you apart from most people in your position. In this context, let's explore these two vital questions that can deeply impress your clients or superiors, showcasing your deep listening and proactive thinking skills.
Deep, Intentional Listening: Reflecting to Confirm Understanding
The first question to ask is: "This is much too important for us not to be on the same page. The main takeaway(s) I should take from our conversation are (repeat back what you believe they are). Do I have that right?"
When you reflect on what has been said, it sends a clear signal that you have been engaged in active listening. Too often, in our fast-paced world, we are preoccupied with the thoughts racing in our minds, half-listening to the words being spoken to us. In that cacophony of distractions, important details can be lost.
By restating the conversation's key points, you achieve three vital outcomes:
Validation:You validate your client or boss by showing that their words were important enough for you to pay full attention.Clarification:You avoid misunderstandings that could later prove costly.Deepening Trust: You build a stronger connection by demonstrating that you truly care about aligning your understanding with theirs.
1. Validation:You validate your client or boss by showing that their words were important enough for you to pay full attention.
2. Clarification:You avoid misunderstandings that could later prove costly.
3. Deepening Trust: You build a stronger connection by demonstrating that you truly care about aligning your understanding with theirs.
Proactive Thinking: Planning and Prioritizing
The second question is equally profound: "And going forward, what are the most important, critical, and urgent things that we get done next, and why those?"
Most people wait for life to happen and then react. Such a reactive approach often leads to inefficiency, wasted resources, and missed opportunities. The magic of this second question lies in its proactive nature.
Asking this question does the following:
Aligns Priorities: You ensure that you are aligned with your client's or boss's priorities, focusing your energy on what truly matters.Creates Urgency: You emphasize that time is of the essence, that you're ready to roll up your sleeves and get to work.Reveals Purpose: Understanding the "why" behind the priorities gives you insight into the broader strategy, allowing you to become a more valuable team player.

2. Creates Urgency: You emphasize that time is of the essence, that you're ready to roll up your sleeves and get to work.
3. Reveals Purpose: Understanding the "why" behind the priorities gives you insight into the broader strategy, allowing you to become a more valuable team player.
The Winning Combination: Active Listening and Forward Thinking
These two questions, when used together, create a powerful impression. The first establishes you as a person who listens with intention, focus, and accuracy. The second characterizes you as someone who thinks ahead, who takes ownership and responsibility.
More than that, these questions aren't just tools to impress. They're instruments to forge stronger connections, foster better understanding, and pave the way for success. They help prevent the mistakes that often arise from miscommunication or lack of clarity.
In a world where automation is becoming prevalent, these soft skills are what will truly distinguish you from the rest. People want to feel heard, understood, and respected. They want partners and employees who are engaged and proactive. When you make these two questions part of your conversational toolkit, you're not just conforming to these desires, you're exceeding them.
In your next conversation with a client or boss, consider using these two questions. They may seem simple on the surface, but their impact can be profound. With deep listening and proactive thinking, you'll not only impress but also lay the groundwork for a successful relationship.
Remember, in the words of Stephen R. Covey, "Most people do not listen with the intent to understand; they listen with the intent to reply." Break that pattern.
Listen to understand, reflect, plan, and, with your client or boss, prosper. You'll distinguish yourself in the best way possible, and you will be on your way to success and maybe more important, respect from your client and boss.
