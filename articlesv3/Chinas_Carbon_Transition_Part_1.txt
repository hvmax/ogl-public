### China's Carbon Transition - Part 1

23 October 2023|China, China politics, Economic Development, Local Government
AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy and, in particular, life in China. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. We have written about economic development in China and China’s economic reforms, US-China relations, China’s changing role in the global political economy, and the history and current state of Chinese politics. In this post, we focus on China’s aspirations and innovation around the issue of environmental degradation, specifically on the issue of carbon neutrality. Common views often depict China as a bad actor or a laggard with respect to environmental issues. China is among the largest contributors, but it has embraced a set of goals and invested in building toward these goals in ways that will make it a global leader in countering environmental degradation.
Currently, China is the world’s largest energy consumer and carbon dioxide (CO₂) emitter, producing annually roughly twice the CO₂ emissions of the world’s second largest producer, the United States. China also has the second largest volume ever in terms of cumulative CO₂ emissions, about half the total produced by the United States. Yet, China is the largest producer of renewable energy and a leader in many parts of the decarbonization effort, such as the manufacturing and application of solar photovoltaic modules, wind turbines, and electric vehicles etc.
In September 2020, President Xi Jinping announced that China would “aim to peak carbon dioxide emissions before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060” (1). The goal means there won’t be any increase in greenhouse emissions in China after 2030 and the amount of carbon dioxide emitted by the whole country will be offset in other ways before 2060. It is the first time that China has committed to a zero-carbon target, and an improvement on its Paris Agreement goal, which was to peak emissions “by 2030.”
This ambitious goal is a result of both endogenous drive and external pressure. Internally, the pursuing of carbon dioxide peaking and carbon neutrality goals (or simplified as “dual carbon” goal) is a catalyst for shifting the country’s growth paradigm towards higher quality and more sustainability. Externally, honoring these words with actions will demonstrate the country’s commitment to its global responsibilities and leadership. China’s leaders have recognized that, in the long term, the model that made the country the world’s second largest economy will not be economically and environmentally sustainable, so achieving “dual carbon” goal is an intrinsic requirement for China, “not under compulsion, but of our own accord” (2).
Growth and Ambitious Innovation in China
So how does China align its global standing in the area of environmental degradation and its goals and plans for addressing this important issue? In previous writing, the OGL Team has spent a significant time analyzing and documenting China’s economic development process over the last four decades (see, e.g., here, here, here). The crux of that analysis is that, while many observers view China as a centrally planned and centrally controlled economy, this is only part of the story and it opens up opportunity for ambitious innovation in the area of climate change.
Because China orchestrates a carefully balanced dance between central mandates and objectives and the encouragement of entrepreneurial economic development activities driven by localities – provinces, municipalities, districts and townships (see, e.g.,here,here,here, it often has the tools and the drive to accomplish goals that seem almost impossible from the outside. China’s prowess in the area of innovation and the ways in which local governments are employing locally driven economic development toward innovation (see, e.g.,here,here,here) can be a powerful leverage in combatting environmental degradation. China is positioning the country to be a leader in this important space as China seeks to transform its energy economy by transitioning to a low-carbon future.
Climate Change and Carbon Emissions
China is in the East Asian monsoon region, an area that has keenly felt the impact of climate change. Its large population and rapidly growing wealth have been exposed to the negative impacts of climate change, an ever-growing challenge to its social economic development.
A review of the data suggests that, in the past 60-100 years, China’s terrestrial climate has shown a significant warming trend, while extreme weather events have become more frequent, more widespread and more costly (3)：
From 1900 to 2018, China's land surface temperature increased 1.3-1.7°C, higher than 0.9-1.5°C globally (1909-2011).Since 1961, although the overall change in annual precipitation in China has not been serious, its fluctuation has significantly increased.In general, the glaciers in western China are shrinking, half of glaciers in China are melting at an accelerated rate.Climate change is raising sea levels along China's coasts. From 1980 to 2019, the rising rate was 3.4mm/a, higher than the global average. Since the 1990s, about 22% of China’s coastline has eroded, and the effects of salty tide intrusion and soil salinization have intensified.

Owing to the rapid growth of the country’s economy and manufacturing capacity China has become the largest energy-consuming country and CO₂ emitter on earth. The energy consumption and carbon emissions of China have the following features:
Energy consumption and carbon emissions have repeatedly reached new highs. The rapid growth of renewable energy has not yet fundamentally changed China's energy structure.Fossil energy still dominates the energy consumption, they the major source of CO₂ emissions in China. Constrained by the energy endowment that is "abundant coal, insufficient oil, and lack of gas", coal accounts for more than half of China's energy consumption and 70% of oil are imported.Power & heat production and the industrial sector are two major sources of CO₂ emission, they are the key focus in China's carbon neutrality pathway.Energy production and energy consumption are spatially unbalanced. The majority of China’s primary energy sources, especially renewable energy resources, are in the western and northern regions, while the electricity consumption mainly happens in the eastern and central regions.

Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC)
The historic 2016 Paris Agreement sets long-term goals to guide all nations to substantially reduce global greenhouse gas emissions to limit the global temperature increase in the 21st century to 2 °Cand preferably to 1.5 °C. NDCs, which contain information on targets, policies and measures for reducing national emissions, as well as the information on finance, technologies and capacity building for these actions, form the basis for countries to achieve the objectives of the Paris Agreement.
After the announcement of “dual carbon” goal, China updated its NDC targets under the terms of the Paris Agreement, namely:
Strive to peak carbon dioxide emissionsbefore 2030and achieve carbon neutralitybefore 2060.Reduce its carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP by over 65 percent from the 2005 level by 2030.Increase the share of non-fossil fuels in primary energy consumption to around 25 percent by 2030. Annual coal consumption must be reduced during the 15th Five-Year Plan (FYP) period (2026 - 2030).By 2030, increase the forest stock by 6 billion m 3 from the 2005 level to 19 billion m3, and increase national forest coverage rate to 25%;Increase total installed capacity of wind and solar power to over 1.2 billion kilowatts by 2030, add installed capacity of hydropower by about 40 million kilowatts during the 14th FYP (2021-2025) and 15th FYP (2026-2030).

Is China’s ambition credible? It is not difficult to find a country that has retreated from their established climate change policy. In 2014, the Australian government repealed a carbon tax that had been proposed for two years. The French government set a goal in 2014 to reduce nuclear share of electricity generation to 50% by 2025, this target was delayed in 2019 to 2035. In June 2017, President Donald Trump announced that the United States would pull out of the Paris Agreement, a major step to walk back US federal climate policy. So far, China has a track record of delivering on major climate initiatives in areas such as energy efficiency, supply of renewable and pollution reduction etc. But China’s carbon-neutrality pledge is on a very different scale, and it must achieve an unprecedented reduction in carbon emissions and move from peak carbon to carbon neutrality faster than any other country in history (5). How that happens will depend on its ability to harness innovation to advance its carbon efforts and to ignite its economy.
