### INTEL IN CHINA TODAY

10 November 2024|China, Chinese Culture, Economic Development, Trade
On Global Leadership’s regular feature OGL Real Time presents our up-to-the-minute insights on current news and events. We hope these breaking news insights from our OGL team members will help illuminate the events of the day and provide the depth needed to understand global political, economic, and cultural transitions and transformations. In this post, we reflect on how foreign companies are navigating China. We focus here on Intel in China and what it means for U.S.-China relations today. We also examine a variety of important issues raised by this dynamic and the ways in which Intel may be at risk in China, taking into account our own views as well as what the OGL team in China sees in local media, social media, and popular sentiment.
It has been a critical time for U.S.-China relations. In previous posts, we have argued that U.S.-China relations are perhaps at the tensest state they have been in 30 years. We have written previously about the critical juncture of U.S.-China relations and the extent to which the city of Phoenix plays a critical role right now because of the investment of Taiwanese semiconductor chip manufacturer TSMC in the region (seehere).
While the United States has aggressively targeted companies like Huawei for more than a decade, limiting the company’s access to U.S. technology through a variety of measures, including the 2023 CHIPS Act, China may be following suit. It may be the case that China is finally fighting back, saying, “You want to discriminate against us? We can do the same to you.”
On Oct. 16, 2024, the Cybersecurity Association of China (CSAC) issued a warning that Intel’s CPU chips contained vulnerabilities that threaten China’s national security. "It is recommended that a network security review is initiated on the products Intel sells in China, so as to effectively safeguard China's national security and the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese consumers," the group said.
The announcement came across multiple communication avenues, including an article in CSAC’s WeChat moments, titled "With frequent security vulnerabilities and high failure rates, Intel products should be subject to a systematic cybersecurity review” (Figure 1).
Founded in Beijing on March 25, 2016, CSAC is a national, industry-based, non-profit social organization under the supervision of the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC), China's governing body on cyberspace security and internet content regulation. While CSAC makes recommendations as a civil society organization, CAC is the regulator.
Intel swiftly defended its product safety and quality: “We will maintain communication with the relevant authorities, clarify any concerns, and reaffirm our commitment to product safety and quality,” the company said in a statement.
There is precedent for China to take action against American semiconductor companies. In 2023, CSAC banned U.S. chipmaker Micron Technology from selling to Chinese companies working on key infrastructure projects, because the firm's products "have relatively serious cybersecurity risks" that could damage China's information supply chains or impact national security.
By comparison, Intel has gotten a warning from CSAC while Micron received substantial penalties from CSAC. The response from the U.S. government is also different. On Intel, so far we have heard nothing, but on Micron, the U.S. Department of State expressed“serious concerns” about China’s move, and U.S. Department of Commerce said the allegations "have no basis in fact."
The statement made by CSAC on Intel was a signal sent by Beijing to Washington and U.S. companies that the cost to curb China's high-tech ambitions could be high. But having this said, the CSAC call didn’t mean that Intel would be kicked out of China, like the U.S. did to Huawei. If Intel “gets the message” and makes corrective action, the door to the Chinese market is open. And it got the message.
The fascinating factor here was how quickly Intel responded to the threat. In less than two weeks, by October 28, Intel had announced that the company would be investing $300 million in the city of Chengdu. If this isn’t a clear signal of how much American companies need to ensure access to the Chinese market, we don’t know what is.
Yet, the same day, the Biden administration announced it was finalizing rules to restrict U.S. investments in semiconductors and microelectronics, quantum information technologies, and certain artificial intelligence (AI) systems in China. The government cited concerns that the investments could threaten U.S. national security.
Intel entered the mainland China market in 1985. Its Chengdu base started operation in 2003, and is one of the company’s largest chip packaging and testing centers globally. The company had invested more than $1.3 billion in China by 2005, with investments in R&D facilities, assembly and testing factories, and training programs.
By 2014, Intel had acquired a 20% stake ($1.5 billion) in Tsinghua Unigroup's subsidiary, UNISOC, which was a mobile chipmaker in China. After 30 years in China, Intel was looking to make wider investments in 2015 into projects focused on the Internet of Things (IoT) and smart devices.
China has been Intel’s biggest market since 2015, supporting both its global and China technological operations. In 2023, China contributed 27.4% of its revenue compared to 25.7% from the U.S. (Figure 3)
It is not the first time Intel ran into trouble in China.
In December 2021, Intel sparked outrage across Chinese social media after the chipmaker sent its annual letter to suppliers claiming that “it is required to ensure our supply chain does not use any labor or source goods or services from the Xinjiang region."
To many Chinese, it was obvious that Intel put above statement into its supplier letter to please anti-China politicians in Washington. What can Intel buy from Xinjiang, tomatoes or a few photovoltaic modules? Facing Chinese netizens' tsunami of anger and calls for boycott, Intel was forced to apologize in China in a public statement, saying:
“Intel has a deep respect for China. We have a long-standing relationship with China, including more than 36 years of investment and deep cooperation in China, and more than 10,000 employees. We have a strong and ongoing commitment to China and to our business partners, customers, employees and the general public in China.
Intel's annual letter to suppliers has sparked media coverage and discussion, especially about the government's requirements for supply chain operations.
We appreciate all of your questions and concerns and respect the sensitivity of this issue in China. As a global company, we are in an ever-changing and complex global environment, which we should respond to and deal with it in a prudent manner.
While our original intention was to ensure compliance with U.S. law, we regret that this letter has raised many questions and concerns among our cherished Chinese partners. To clarify, the paragraph on Xinjiang in the letter is only intended to be compliant and legal and is not intended to imply or express a position.
We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause to our esteemed Chinese customers, partners and the public.
Intel is committed to being a trusted technology partner and accelerating our development with China.”
Three years ago, Intel's timely apology got the situation under control. Now Intel is again in hot water. CSAC's allegations this time include:
Frequent security vulnerabilities;Poor reliability, ignoring user complaints;Use remote management features to surveil users; andCovertly install backdoors, posing significant threats to network and information security.
• Frequent security vulnerabilities;
• Poor reliability, ignoring user complaints;
• Use remote management features to surveil users; and
• Covertly install backdoors, posing significant threats to network and information security.
In addition, CSAC specifically blamed Intel for "biting the hand that feeds it“. Intel is the biggest beneficiary of the U.S. CHIPS and Science Act (which undermines China’s ability on semiconductors in the opinion of many Chinese), continues to engage in actions that harm China's interests and threaten national security while making substantial profits in China. CSAC picked some behaviors of Intel which “please the U.S. government but hurt China”:
Aggressively take a stand on the Xinjiang issue to suppress China;In its financial reports, Taiwan Province is listed alongside China, the United States, and Singapore; andTake the initiative to cut off supply and stop services to Chinese companies such as Huawei and ZTE.
• Aggressively take a stand on the Xinjiang issue to suppress China;
• In its financial reports, Taiwan Province is listed alongside China, the United States, and Singapore; and
• Take the initiative to cut off supply and stop services to Chinese companies such as Huawei and ZTE.
In all fairness, accusing Intel of deliberately appeasing the U.S. government is a bit far-fetched. We have described in detail the old story of the supplier letter related to Xinjiang, and it's not uncommon for multinational companies to list Taiwan as a sales region rather than a country. These deliberate accusations tell people that it is not difficult for Beijing to target American companies, just as Washington has done to Chinese companies.
Why did Beijing pick CSAC to hammer Intel? We see this as a symbolic move to send out a signal to Washington and multinational companies who have business interests in China, a leeway not aiming to kick Intel out of the Chinese market. The Chinese leaders are clear that Beijing will not have much leverage over an American company that does not rely on Chinese market or supply chain. The best way to maintain the influences on U.S. companies is to let them take profits from the Chinese market (if they are competitive enough) and keep them inseparable from China’s supply chain. Compared to completely expulsion of Chinese companies like Huawei from the U.S. market, we think Beijing's strategy is more sophisticated and smarter.
For multinational companies, not turning such symbolic warnings to substantive punishments is the basic skill they are required to have. They should be able to endure, properly handle and balance pressures from all parties in the new normal of rising geopolitical tensions and especially escalating US–China competition.
As an aside, we have written about the pressure other multinational companies, like Apple, have received from the Chinese government in the last decade (see, e.g.,here). We have shown the ways in whichApple and Teslahave kowtowed to the Chinese government to maintain their position in the world’s most powerful manufacturing economy.
On October 28th, Intel announced an additional $300 million investment for the expansion of its packaging and testing facility in Chengdu, capital of Southwest China's Sichuan Province, to enhance the efficiency of the local supply chain. To Beijing, the new investment plan from Intel is a positive move, painted by Chinese media as “US firms not deterred from China despite pressure by Washington.”
Further, we believe there are some outstanding questions:
Has Intel China ever thought of becoming a member of CSAC? As CSAC's Articles of Association do not prohibit foreign-registered companies in China from becoming its members, why not have a try?What is the impact of the recent Middle East pagers and walkie-talkies explosion cases? We should not be surprised that CSAC is under pressure to come up with a plan to screen out all the devices used by government organizations with risks. So, the pick on Intel which heavily relies on this market might be one stone to kill two birds, the second bird can be setting forward a tone for others for the new scrutiny CSAC will execute on.

Finally, some rumors on other things Intel is doing in the region: It appears that Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger will visit Taiwan to meet with TSMC executives. And we should note that, while TSMC’s investment in the Phoenix area is very significant. In September 2021, Intel broke ground on two new leading-edge chip factories at the company’s Ocotillo campus in Chandler, Arizona. The $20 billion investment was the largest in Arizona's history. Today, Intel's presence in the region also helps it secure its relationship with the Taiwanese chip manufacturer. Fascinating and important times.
