Question:From March 4-11, the 2022 China Two Sessions were held in Beijing. After the Two Sessions, a batch of important China economic data and policies were released. In recent weeks, attention has been focused on China's attitude toward the Russian invasion of Ukraine, but we cannot ignore the impact of this economic data and policies.
The latest economic data.When the National Bureau of Statistics of China (NBS) released the economic data for January and February 2022 on March 15, it employed the headline: "National economy recovered better than expected in the first two months of 2022". There are two key words worth noting in this title: the first one is "Recovered", which represents an official judgment that China's economy is still affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, and the second is the term "Better than expected". Looking at the month-on-month statistics, supply and demand data show better performance than Q4 2021. From a year-on-year growth perspective, the growth rates of industry, investment, and consumption are all higher than the average of the past two years. The growth rate of the service industry is much lower than the level before the pandemic, and is below the average growth rate of the previous two years. Thus, NBS expects a good economic performance in the first quarter of 2022, but there are worries about weaker market demand.
2022 GDP growth target.At the National People's Congress in early March, China set a higher-than-expected GDP growth target of about 5.5 percent for 2022. Achieving such an aggressive target means that China's incremental GDP in 2022 will be half the 2021 GDP of Canada, the world's ninth largest economy. There are a number of factors here: the continued downward pressure on China's economy, due to COVID-19, geopolitical tensions vis-à-vis Russia/Ukraine; the rising proportion of the service industry that is still suffering from COVID-19; the disappearance of the demographic dividend; and continued deterioration of U.S.-China relations. Given all of these variables, the 5.5% goal is actually an old trick of “attacking” in order to defend the economy. The central government in Beijing hopes setting this target will boost the confidence of the outside world and motivate local governments. Forecasting China's economic outlook for 2022 is generally built on some basic premises: 1) The Chinese government takes economic development as its top priority; 2) There will be no full-scale confrontation and conflict between China and the United States in terms of politics, military, economy, and technology; and 3) Large-scale conflicts and regional wars will not occur in China's surrounding areas (e.g., the Korean Peninsula) and border areas (e.g., the South China Sea, Taiwan Strait, etc.). Beijing announced its 2022 economic growth target 10 days after the outbreak of the Ukrainian war, a sign that Chinese leaders have not significantly changed their judgment on China's overall development environment.
Foreign investment:The Ministry of Commerce also disclosed foreign investment data in March. From January to February, the actual use of foreign capital nationwide was ￥243.7 billion (1), a year-on-year increase of 37.9% (equivalent to US$37.86 billion, a year-on-year increase of 45.2%). The star is the high-tech field – the actual use of foreign capital increased by 73.8% year-on-year, with the high-tech manufacturing industry increasing by 69.2%, and the high-tech service industry increasing by 74.9%. On March 15, National Consumer Protection Day, not a single foreign brand was negatively exposed by CCTV, another positive signal sent by China to foreign investors.
Capital Markets: Amid the recent capital market turmoil in China’s mainland, Hong Kong and U.S.-listed Chinese stocks, Vice Premier Liu chaired a meeting on March 15 of the financial stability and development committee under China's State Council. The meeting sent a strong signal to keep the markets stable. According to the meeting reports, policies that are favorable for the capital markets should be rolled out and the unveiling of contractionary measures should be cautious. Any policy that has a significant impact on the capital market should be coordinated with the financial regulatory authorities in advance to maintain stable and consistent expectations. The meeting was also seen as the end of the bombardment of regulatory scrutiny on Chinese tech, which has been going on since November 2020. As a result, China concept stocks rebounded sharply, e.g., shares of Alibaba (BABA) soared +40% higher in a week. One day after the meeting, China's Finance Ministry put property tax reform on hold because the conditions are not suitable. Three months ago, the Central Economic Work Conference, which all CPC Politburo Standing Committee attended, made the decision to expand the reform to other cities in 2022.
Chinese Tech: In March, social media platforms in China were full of layoff news from major Internet companies, including Alibaba, Tencent, JD.com, etc., and some their BUs (business units) had layoff ratios as high as 30%. For anyone following the financial performance of these companies, it is clear their businesses have basically covered most of their target markets in China, so they have passed the period of rapid development. For example, Tencent's net profit growth in 2021 is the lowest in nearly a decade. Today, these Internet-platform companies can no longer support loss-making business as they did in the past, and the layoffs are part of the cost-cutting measures. As we mentioned in previous posts, hardcore tech companies like Huawei and SMIC are currently more favored in China. The government will provide more support to the development of cutting-edge technologies and create a favorable environment for technological innovation and entrepreneurship.
China & the Russia-Ukraine War
Question:In online comments, we read daily there are “wolf worrier” types that regularly support Russian military advancement. Conspiracy theorists argue that the U.S. is playing tricks that undermine NATO and separate the countries so it can continue as the leader of the West. There are also fantasies that China is making a slow-moving Tai Chi play, so that U.S. and Russian fighting allows China to restructure the global power dynamic. We have compiled some of the common and more mediated thoughts regarding China’s position on Ukraine.
China and Russia are Different
Currently, China and Russia have a relationship that is called "back-to-back" strategic cooperation. But China and Russia have different pasts, presents, and futures. In short, there are great differences between China and Russia.
China and Russia have different historical and cultural traditions. China has an uninterrupted historical and cultural tradition for thousands of years. Prominent Chinese thinkers have left China with pearls of wisdom including “harmony is most charitable” and “unity in diversity” to be followed, with doctrines of governing the country.
China began to build the Great Wall in the Qin Dynasty more than 2,000 years ago, and the succeeding dynasties continued to build it. China has long been introverted rather than expansionary; that is, it hopes to prevent the invasion of foreign enemies and defend its territory rather than being keen to plunder others. Another example: unlike Western expansionism, General Zheng He's fleets during the Ming Dynasty took the lead in the world, but these fleets brought glorious greetings and exchange wherever they went, rather than colonization and pillage.
China's territory today reflects thousands of years of integration, which is completely different from that of Russia, which has become a big country across Europe and Asia in the last 500 years after Russia gained independence in the middle of the 16th century. For example, Ukraine didn’t become part of the Russian empire until 1793, and then battled the Russian and Soviet yokes for the next two centuries until Ukraine declared its independence in 1991.
China and Russia are also different in their national interests. Russia inherited the huge nuclear arsenal of the Soviet Union and has rich oil, gas, minerals, and other resources. It is not only a vast territory with abundant resources, but also controls the energy supply line of European countries, which offsets its weak economic development. Its strategic importance and resistance are unsusceptible to its world power position. Russia can bargain through tough measures such as war, and even threaten its opponents with its nuclear capability.
China also has vast territory and water, but it also has a large population, and scarce resources. Oil and gas are largely controlled by other countries, and China has close economic and trade ties with many of those countries. Geographically, it is the country with the largest number of neighbors (14 by land, 6 by water). All these factors have shaped China's national interests and the need for a peaceful interaction with its shared-border nations.
China's adherence to an independent foreign policy of peace and non-interventionism is not only the influence of historical and cultural traditions, but also the choice of realistic national interests. In terms of foreign affairs, including the treatment of surrounding nations, China has been restrained, mostly choosing the path of peaceful coexistence and mutual benefit. China actually voted for sanctions against Russia in 2014 after it annexed Crimea.
Facing a common pressure
It is true that China and Russia are now facing the strategic squeeze of the United States, the only superpower. The economies of the China and Russia are highly complementary, which accounts for why the two countries have the same or similar views on many international issues at this stage. The two countries have continued high-level mutual cooperation, especially in light of the U.S. putting together the Quad, the AUKUS, which is a trilateral security pact between Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States, and providing arms to Japan and South Korea in the Asia Pacific region.
China is bound to sympathize with Russia's security dilemma, which is caused by the U.S. and the West’s promotion of the eastward expansion of NATO. In fact, China understands President Vladimir Putin's decision better than most other countries. This is the reason why China is unwilling to say that Russia's military advancement in Ukraine is an “invasion”, and instead emphasizes that it should see the deep background of the crisis. It is also the reason why it is impossible for the U.S. to persuade China to abandon Sino-Russia cooperation, despite the jarring images of massacred civilians in the Kyiv suburbs of Bucha, Irpin, and Hostomel.
Further, if the United States and Western countries continue to put pressure on Russia by arming Ukraine, it will result in a serious imbalance in the international security pattern. China and Russia are bound to carry out closer cooperation to ensure what they see as an international security balance regardless of the costs in Ukraine. Still, China claims it cooperates with Russia but they are not allies.
China Has Its Own Stance
The differences between China and Russia, however, ensure China will not fully agree with Russia's position on the Ukrainian crisis. China must make independent judgments based on the merits of the matter itself. Therefore, China would not further incite the war by sending weapons to either side, but would choose to provide humanitarian assistance to the Ukrainian people, and strive to promote peace negotiations between the two countries. In this way, China will continue to develop economic and trade exchanges with Russia and Ukraine, if possible. Both countries are important economic and trade partners of China. Ukraine is an important hub of the Belt and Road Initiative, although China’s neutrality in this war may have an impact on Ukraine’s interest in a post-war relationship with China.
At present, China believes the U.S. is exaggerating China’s interest in providing weapons to Russia, considering it to be a public opinion tactic to discredit the country. China hopes the Ukrainian people realize that they are acting as pawns of other countries and fighting a proxy war. Instead, they should negotiate with Russia in good faith. This attitude is unlikely to win many friends in Ukraine, which is fighting a foreign invader on its home territory, facing increasing civilian deaths and rampant destruction wrought by Russia, and feel Russia has not shown any “good faith” so far in this war.
The United States and Western countries should not interfere in the normal cooperation between China and Russia while they try their best to instigate the armed Kiev authorities. Rather, they should immediately stop sending weapons to Ukraine to fuel the war, abandon the attempt of NATO's eastward expansion and seek to build a new European security pattern acceptable and comfortable to all parties. Again, this view of the war ignores what is viewed as Russia’s recent predatory tactics against former Soviet republics that have enjoyed their independence now for decades.
As far as the Asia Pacific region is concerned, China believes the strategy adopted by the United States in Europe and Asia is the same. That is, it is to create military alliances and use territorial disputes and military deployment to provoke conflicts between countries in the region and major countries such as China and Russia. This approach allows the U.S. to suppress America’s competitors, disrupt the existing military dynamics, and attract capital flow back to the United States.
At the same time, China will adhere to its national policy of reform and opening up as well as developing a friendly and sincere foreign policy. China hopes to drive the development of surrounding countries along with its own development to form a closer community of interests and shared future. It maintains this community will resolve the incitement and provocation of the United States, and maintain peaceful relations in the Asia Pacific.
China believes regional countries in the Asia Pacific should take the Ukrainian crisis as a lesson of sorts and should focus on how to jointly maintain regional peace and tranquility and accelerate regional economic and social development.
