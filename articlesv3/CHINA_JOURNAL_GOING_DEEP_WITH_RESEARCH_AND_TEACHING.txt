### CHINA JOURNAL: GOING DEEP WITH RESEARCH AND TEACHING

AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide analyses about leadership in the global economy. In this post, Dr. Doug Guthrie, who is a co-founder of OGL, is continuing his series of China Journal entries. After returning to China in December of 2023, his first time back in the country since 2019, Guthrie curated a special series of China Journal entries reflecting on observations on returning to China after his COVID break. In May of 2024, he returned to China again to press on with his research, help his educational institution (Thunderbird School of Global Management at Arizona State University) to develop its presence in China, and continue his efforts to assist the West in better understand China today. In this post, he explores the intersection of research and teaching.
As I grew as a China scholar, I focused overwhelmingly on products and outcomes. The goal was to know and understand China deeply, so I could display that knowledge in some written document – a book, a research article or a report for a client – to help the consumer of the product gain a deeper understanding of the subject. The research was the means to the end of disseminating knowledge.
Over the years, I have come to realize how important the experience of conducting the research is, nearly as crucial a part of the experience as producing the research. The deeper I've delved into the gathering of the knowledge, the more I've realized that the process of gathering information from individual conversations or visits to distant sites has the potential to not only enrich my research but also to enrich my life.
My time in China has been a reminder of that essential fact as I've visited various sites across China and offered insights to colleagues and received insights back from them. It is a virtuous circle of learning that adds to our common knowledge. Here are a few photos of my visits in China.
My colleague Chris Gao and I met with leaders from the Jingkou Economic Development Zone, including Mr. Yu, a member of the leadership team of the Zhenjiang Municipal Bureau of Commerce; Mr. Liu Bin, Deputy Director of Zhenjiang International Investment Promotion Center and head of the Shanghai Investment Promotion Office of Zhenjian; and Ms. Wang Xue, Deputy Director of the Management Committee of the Zone, who is responsible for investment attraction and business promotion.
