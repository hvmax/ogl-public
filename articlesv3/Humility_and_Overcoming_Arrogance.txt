The costs of narcissistic leadership run deep. It destabilizes organizations and relationships, both personal and professional. On the scale practiced by Presidents, Senators and Business Leaders, it weakens society and the legal and political institutions we’ve come to rely on, maybe even take for granted. But it is a problem for leaders at all levels of organizations. Here is the problem: we teach our young leaders to be bold, trust their instincts, follow their North Star; and we reward them with new jobs and titles for doing those things. But probably the most important part of true leadership is being humble, learning to listen to the people around you, finding the balance between motivating people and being kind.
I am not just taking shots at political or business leaders. I am taking aim at the destructive tendencies of arrogance because I know the price of allowing pride to overpower your thinking and conceit to dominate your leadership. It is a cost we can ill afford to pay today.
I’ve fallen victim to a devastating egotism in leading myself. As dean of the George Washington University School of Business (GWSB) in 2010, I was a rising star in the academic community. It was a heady time. I was meeting with global business leaders, jetting around the world to consult on projects, and writing my own story in big, bold letters.
Then I was dismissed from GWSB in August 2013. Why? The newspapers tell a story that doesn’t reflect the reality as I know it. Suffice it to say, I was inexperienced and too impatient. I failed at leading my team, in part, because I forgot the lessons I was teaching daily to my students. Most importantly, I lacked the humility necessary to succeed in the job.
Recently, I spoke with Brian Miller at Coach Approach Ministries about my time at GWSB and the importance of humility in teaching and coaching about leadership. OurOvercoming Arrogance conversationtook many turns and prompted me to ruminate about my failures and successes at GWSB.
Since 2013, I have learned a great deal, both from the loss of my deanship and the professional struggles and achievements that came later. I have written abouthumility and leadershipforForbes, and I have lectured about leadership and humility during my five years as a Faculty Member of Apple University, where I spent my time helping to develop Apple's business leaders in China.
One true thing I know about leadership today is that studying, teaching, researching, and pontificating on it does nothing to prepare you for leadership; and leadership requires so much more humility than most leaders are able to acknowledge.
