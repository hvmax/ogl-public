### University Reopening in the COVID Era: Up Close and Personal

4 September 2020|Coronavirus, Higher education
AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. We have sought to advance a deeper conversation of the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on real lives. This post adds to that conversation. In a question-and-answer format, we have two college students—one in Canada and the other in the United States—having a dialogue about the decision by higher education institutions in North America to open their doors to in-person classes. They have two very different viewpoints of this moment, and we are happy to share their views. – The Editorial Team

What has been your experience so far with the pandemic and your studies?

CB: I completed my undergraduate degree at McGill University in early July. My final semester was interrupted by COVID-19 in March and moved entirely online. I witnessed a school of 30,000 transition to online learning and was very impressed. Professors teaching 180-student lectures made themselves available for one-on-one Zoom office hours, granting extensions, and, in some cases, ending courses all together and grading from existing submitted material. Put simply, the forced transition to online learning revealed some of the best creative and humble leadership in the professors who adapted to the transition.
JS: It has been and it still is a crazy and chaotic time, so I feel like I’m living day to day. I am back at school right now, but each day you don’t know what the university is going to do and you don’t know if your friends are going to be exposed or not. We’ve learned to live with that uncertainty. I can’t just sit here and cry about my senior year disappearing and then decide I’m not going to experience anything or even try to. Everyone is in the same boat and we just have to make the best of it without putting ourselves in unnecessary danger.
Universities are and have been opening their doors to students for the fall term. What is your reaction to this decision?
CB: Millions of 18-year-olds, socially starved for the last six months in quarantine, are returning to campus dorms, to dining halls and quads, to gyms and frats in what is likely the biggest blunder of our higher educational leadership in a long time. A bit harsh? Yes, but opening campuses this coming fall semester, whether it be in-person or a hybrid model, constitutes a huge error on the part of the administration that will disproportionately put their educators, and the families of their educators, at risk.

JS: For me personally, I like having in-person classes. My film production classes need to be in person or I’ll be missing out on that experience, especially as a senior. I also am apprehensive about contracting the virus because college kids are notoriously bad decision-makers. I recognize the university is going to inevitably close down, but getting us started in our classes, at least in person, will help boost us through to the finish line. But I do feel for freshman who are living by themselves alone in their dorm rooms for social distancing. I can’t imagine going through my freshman year sitting in my dorm on Zoom all day alone.
What is your take on how this decision has been made by academic leaders?
CB: The decision to reopen higher educational institutions has revealed some of the blind spots in leadership practices. Beyond the politics of profits, endowments, and research initiatives, we must discuss the baseline currency we have put at risk in this decision—human lives. While younger students who drunkenly decide to attend a day-drink (who can blame them?) are probably not going to die from COVID-19 (although a 19-year-old Montreal student just died the other day), the professors and administrators who demonstrated such powerful leadership back in March and April will be the ones who bear the very fatal results. Our presidents and deans need to lead through uncertainty in this moment, putting the livelihood of their professors and staff before their own economic interests.
JS: I’ve had nothing but great experiences with the university the past three years. I can’t imagine what they must be going through with trying to decide how to keep the students, the faculty, and staff safe right now. All colleges are hurting, and I’m frustrated, of course, but I am hesitant to take aim at the university for it. If they didn’t bring us all back, they may not be able to come back themselves. You will never make everyone happy, and if the university had been all online, there would have been a lot of students who would have been unhappy and wouldn’t have chosen to go to school.
How are students reacting to having to make this kind of decision?
CB: My sister graduated from high school in the midst of this pandemic and ultimately decided to take a gap year instead of joining her small, liberal arts college for a hybrid model of learning. Earlier this summer when she was deciding what to do, I told her that I thought a hybrid model really just translated to “we’re going to do in-person learning and activities until the inevitable outbreak occurs and then we will move back into a fully online model.” This is a lie being sold to college students across America. This lie is especially nefarious because it puts the educators themselves at risk.
JS: Some people were saying they were nervous to go to in-person classes. I’m feeling good about going to in-person classes, but I feel it’s this false sense of security. How would we know if we contracted the virus? It feels kind of inevitable. I’m taking the proper precautions but no one is under the impression that we’re going to stay open all the time. My professors have been really understanding to that, even the ones who are operating in person. They had the choice to be in person or online at our university so they’ve been very understanding students can’t come to class, if that’s the case. I’ve never felt forced into the environment, and I was aware of the dangers of it.
Is this putting too much of a burden on students?
CB: In Canada, while daily new cases are very low, the decision to reopen schools demonstrates a miscalculation of leadership that assumes 18 year olds will make the safe decision to respect social distancing protocol and wear masks. Our higher educational administrations need to step up to the plate and realize thattheyare responsible for creating a safe learning environment this coming year, regardless of if the transition threatens profit margins and endowment depth. And we want to blame the 18-year-olds, right?
JS: Not all of the students are as cautious as my friends and I are. I’m frustrated by that. I don’t want to get COVID and I especially don’t want to spread COVID. The university brought us back here, but the students are making their own decisions about safety. My roommates and I went to play tennis, a good socially distanced sport. As we walked over to the courts, we ran into 60 students playing volleyball and basketball, without masks. I’m putting myself in that danger knowingly, and I want people to respect my mask. And I also know that I won’t be going back to my immediate family and put them in danger if the university sticks with in-person classes.
How do colleges and universities move forward from here?
CB: Creating the next normal today is going to require the best of every single person on this earth. We are seeing the inherent biases and privileges of our age-old institutions exposed by this virus, forcing all of us into isolation. Let’s make the best of this moment and not point the finger at students whose freshman year has already been taken away from them. We need to be more creative and humble leaders today in order to build the next normal, and it starts with our institutions. In this case, it starts with our higher educational institutions.
JS: Every young person in college is going through the same thing so you have to do what is best for you. If that means taking a gap year before your freshman year, that’s your decision. I don’t have the solution for you. You have to weigh the options for you personally, and I think we’re all hoping that a vaccine will be found and we can return to normal in 2021. Everyone is just trying to make the best decisions based on what they know. Saying universities don’t care for their students misses the point. They care about their students and the faculty and staff. But we also know that the university won’t be here if it doesn’t make the hard decisions, and those aren’t decisions anybody wants to make.
How will you look back on this time?
CB: This is my first fall no longer being a student and the pressure is certainly high. As my sister settles in to working at a horse farm in Vermont and I settle into WFH at my new apartment in downtown Montreal, I feel the border between Canada and the U.S. looming between me and my family. The decisions made in colleges and universities across these two countries in the next few months will likely impact the border closure and my decision to go home and visit my family or not. I hope that a year from now we can all look back on this academic term and remember the exceptional leadership skills our higher educational officers displayed when reopening schools. I only fear that the deaths will steal the spotlight.
JS: I don’t feel like my hopes and dreams have changed. Its dramatic to say, but I do feel like life as I knew it is over because of COVID. I’m in such a transitory place in my life because I’m at college and starting my first career. When this started, I was a junior in college, so by the time we all get back to normal, my life is going to be so completely different because I’ll be in a different part of my life entirely. It is scary to think that almost overnight my life changed.
As of 4 p.m. Thursday, September 10, 2020, Grand Valley State University reported that 451 students and faculty have tested positive for COVID-19 since doors opened on August 17, 2020.
