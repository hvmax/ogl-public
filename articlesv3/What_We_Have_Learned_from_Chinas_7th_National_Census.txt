### What We Have Learned from China's 7th National Census

17 May 2021|China, China Population
AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy and, in particular, life in China. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. We have sought to advance a conversation about the U.S.-China relationship, and a deep understanding of local economic development in China. We have been writing about the U.S.-China Trade War as it relates toChinese Innovation;entrepreneurship in China today;anda series aboutChina’s Belt and Road Initiativeandthestrength oflocal economic development in China’s 2nd and 3rd tier cities. In this post, we engage with the discussion surrounding China’s most recent census results. – The Editorial Team

The long-awaited seventh national census data was finally released on May 11th, 2021. As analysts of China, the OGL team has lost no time in putting forth our interpretation of this once-a-decade population census. There have been a number of reporters, pundits, and scholars, who have looked at the numbers and voiced their concerns and conclusions. TheBBCominously noted that China Census “data shows the slowest population growth in decades.”Reutersnoted that “China demographic crisis looms as population growth slips to lowest ever.” In any oddly backhanded view of the issue,TheFinancial Timesargued that “Lousy demographics will not stop China’s rise.” Most pundits have noted the slow growth numbers. And this is not a surprise. Without exception,allrapidly industrializing economies experience declining population growth rates; and in the wake of 35 years of population controls through the One-Child Policy, the looming demographic bubble in China is not a surprise. However, the results still do merit careful analysis.
China's population, while still growing at an average rate of .53% between 2011 – 2020 is the lowest in decades. With 1.29 billion people in the 2000 census, that number has climbed to 1.41 billion in 2020. In the early years of the economic reforms, there was considerable concern over the changing gender balance of society – somepundits and scholarsargued that the One-Child Policy was changing the dynamics of natural equilibrium of birth processes. However, the last two decades show significant stabilization in this trend. During the same period, family size in China has declined significantly. An average family size of 2.62 is not completely out of bounds for industrialized nations (Japan’s is 2.71), but it does signal the coming “demographic bubble” that many have predicted.

2.Chinese Society is Aging
Chinese society is aging. Over the course of the last 20 years, the percentage of the population in the youngest age group (0-14) has declined by about 3%; population in the “productive” age group (15-59) had decline by about 3%; and the population in the 60+ age group has risen by about 15%. At this point, the average age of the Chinese population (38.8) is slightly higher than that of the citizens of its largest trading partner, the United States (38.1). These are important statistics, as they underline the concerns about the aging of Chinese society and negative replacement rates.
3.The Population Migration
Population at provincial level has changed significantly. People have moved from Central and North East provinces to coastal provinces, while the population in the West provinces has also grown.
4.Non-Mainland China Residents
While non-mainland China residents are growing overall, it's clear expatriates are leaving. This decline in numbers may be the results of management localization of foreign-invested companies (which would not necessarily be a negative) and the concerns about the deterioration of the U.S.-China relations (whichwouldbe a more negative feature of these trends).

5.Economic Performance in 2020 by Province
Using 7th Census population data to calculate per capita economic data at provincial level, the trends are clear:
From the perspective of GDP, the gap between the East and West of the Chinese economy is narrowing, and the gap between the North and the South is widening.From the per capita GDP indicator, the North-South gap is relatively smaller. Guangdong Province, which ranks first in total GDP, ranks seventh in per capita GDP.Per capita budgets are not showing any big discrepancies, which means the provinces with lower budgets got bigger transfer payments from the central government – the mechanism of equilibrium.
