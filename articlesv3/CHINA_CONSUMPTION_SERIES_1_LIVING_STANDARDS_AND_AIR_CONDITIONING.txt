### CHINA CONSUMPTION SERIES 1: LIVING STANDARDS AND AIR CONDITIONING

29 August 2025|China's Transforming Economy
AtOn Global Leadership, we have developed a deep analysis of the Chinese economy and the Chinese economic transformation over the last 45 years. We have written about China’s innovative approach to building the most dynamic manufacturing supply chain in the world and China’s approach to building the world’s most dynamic capitalist economy. We have advanced this through our work on China’ssecond- andthird-tier city development of innovative,entrepreneurial citiesandlocal industrial clusters. We have also used the field of NewEconomy Sociology(with leaders likeNeil Fligstein,Walter Powell, andHarrison White) and theNew Structural Economics(Justin Lin,林毅夫). In this post, we follow up on a meeting with one of the world’s leading economists, Professor Justin Lin. In that meeting, Professor Lin asked OGL to lay out our analysis of what was happening in China’s Consumption Economy development. This article is the first in a series of OGL analyses on this topic. To dive into this topic, we look deeply into specific issues of the consumption economy, in this case the use of air conditioning.

Early summer 2025 saw heat waves gripping both China and Europe, making air conditioning a trending topic on social media. The increasing adoption of air conditioners in Chinese households not only reflects a surge in consumption capacity and improved living standards but also provides a key perspective for understanding the transformation of China's consumer landscape and quality of life.
On July 8, Harbin Engineering University issued a tender to procure 9,955 air conditioners with a budget of 18.5 million yuan. The bids was opened on July 29, and the winning bidder must install and commission the units within 25 days to ensure the university is ready for first-year students arriving in September. While the university library currently has air conditioning, dormitories have become the priority due to this year's summer heatwave in Northeast China.
In late June, Northeast China experienced rare and intense heatwaves, with temperatures soaring to 35°C–37°C. Heilongjiang Province (黑龙江) typically has an average summer (June–August) temperature of 20.7°C. This year from June 23rd to 27th, the province saw its first heat wave, with most areas recording temperatures above 30°C for five consecutive days. Both Harbin (哈尔滨), the provincial capital, and Mohe (漠河), China's northernmost city, experienced temperatures over 35°C.
In Jilin Province (吉林), average temperatures from June 22nd to July 13th ranged from 22.8°C to 26.9°C, much higher than the historical average. Cities like Baicheng (白城) and Changchun (长春) set new temperature records for the period.
Air conditioning has become a critical necessity across China, where summers bring widespread high temperatures—particularly the intense heat and humidity in southern regions. With economic growth and rising living standards, its penetration rate has surged significantly. According to National Bureau of Statistics data (1), by the end of 2023, China averaged 145 air conditioning units per 100 households (171.7 in urban areas, 105.7 in rural areas). However, 13 provinces including Jilin(吉林), Gansu(甘肃), and Guizhou(贵州) still have ownership below 100 units per 100 households.
This disparity reflects regional differences in climate, economic development, and urban-rural structure. Provinces with lower air conditioner penetration are mainly in northern, northwestern, and southwestern areas, where summers are milder and demand for space cooling appliances is naturally lower. These regions also have less developed economies and larger rural populations, which further limit the use of expensive, energy-intensive appliances like air conditioners.
China's air conditioning market exhibits significant regional disparities, reflecting differences in consumption potential across regions. In areas with lower ownership rates, rising incomes, accelerated urbanization, improved infrastructure, and more frequent heatwaves are fueling substantial latent demand for new installations, demonstrated by the sharp increase in AC sales in Northeast China this year.
In contrast, in regions with high per-household ownership, such as the southeastern coast and major cities, demand has transitioned from initial adoption to replacement and upgrades, characterized by two key trends. First, the replacement of outdated units has become widespread, driven by government trade-in programs and natural 8–12-year replacement cycles, with inefficient models being replaced by energy-efficient, smart, health-focused, and comfort-enhancing alternatives. Second, the demand for multiple AC units per household is increasing, as improved living conditions and rising comfort expectations encourage installation in additional rooms. These regional differences underscore the diverse drivers influencing each stage of market development.
China's widespread summer air conditioning usage reflects living standards that surpass what its per capita GDP ranking might suggest. Despite ranking around 70th globally in per capita GDP, placing it in the middle tier, China's air conditioner penetration and usage intensity exceed those of many countries with similar or higher income levels, indicating a relative advantage in quality of life. In the hot and humid Yangtze River Basin and South China regions, air conditioners have become household necessity, with adoption and usage levels comparable to those in developed countries with significantly higher GDPs, such as the United States, Japan, and South Korea. In some cases, usage even surpasses that of Mediterranean countries like Spain, southern France, and Italy, which also experience hot summers. A further comparison with tropical and subtropical developing countries, such as those in Southeast Asia, South Asia, and parts of Latin America, reveals significant gaps. These countries lag behind China in air conditioner penetration, average usage hours, and geographic coverage, largely due to underdeveloped power infrastructure, high electricity costs, and limited household purchasing power.
Air conditioner, a unique "barometer of living standards," offers a revealing gauge of China's evolving consumption landscape and progress in people's livelihoods. Its widespread adoption not only mirrors Chinese people's pursuit of a more comfortable life, driving the economy's critical shift from quantitative expansion to qualitative growth, but also highlights regional disparities in consumption potential and living standards. This reminds us that ultimately, the "temperature" of a society is best measured not by numerical metrics, but by the collective warmth of its people's well-being.
