AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide analyses about leadership in the global economy. In this post, we touch on the issues of trauma, vulnerability, and mental health, with insights from our newest contributor and partner Dr. Mark Goulston, who is a co-founder of OGL’s Deeper Coaching Institute, which seeks to unlock the hidden potential within people who feel blocked in advancing their lives and careers, giving them the tools to break free. In this post, Mark delves into the tension between individual expression and identity (feelings, thoughts, beliefs, and biases) on the one hand, and shared group or collective values and responsibilities (be they company, organizational, societal) on the other.
By Dr. Mark Goulston
As a seasoned psychiatrist, executive coach, and business advisor, I've had the privilege of interacting with countless professionals. And time and again, I've seen the power of actions over mere thoughts, beliefs, and biases.
At a recent 100 Coaches (a community of top coaches in the world) meeting in Nashville, two luminaries, former Ford CEO Alan Mulally and top executive coach Marshall Goldsmith, shared insights that encapsulated this observation impeccably. Mulally’s mantra for his employees was as striking as it was profound: "Your feelings, thoughts, beliefs and biases don't really matter; what matters is how you will act while at work and in any capacity where you are representative of our company."
Now, this might sound harsh, maybe even dehumanizing. Neither of which in any way would describe the perception of the world of Mulally, who is universally admired, respected, and beloved. But I assure you, it is anything but. In its essence, he is calling for an important recalibration of our perspective towards what matters in a professional setting.
It's not about disregarding or invalidating personal feelings or thoughts. It's about emphasizing the importance of actions in the workplace and how these actions should align with the company's values and code of conduct. If you don't act in accordance with these standards, you'll be held accountable, regardless of your personal beliefs or biases. This statement is powerful because it underlines that while we cannot control people’s minds, we can indeed influence their actions.
It is actions or the lack thereof that are tangible, visible, and most importantly, actionable. They shape the workplace, determine its culture, and drive its success. Our thoughts, feelings, beliefs, and biases are important, but they remain within us. They don't necessarily translate into action unless we allow them to. And while they might guide us, they shouldn't dictate our actions, especially when those actions affect others and the organization at large.
Complementing Mulally's viewpoint, Goldsmith brought in an enlightening twist. He mentioned that behavioral change often leads to changes in feelings, thoughts, and beliefs, more than the other way around. This is counterintuitive to popular belief, where we tend to think that we first need to change our mindset to change our behavior. But in practice, the act of changing behavior can lead to a shift in our internal narratives.
In my coaching experience, I've found this to be true. Leaders who shift from authoritarian to authoritative, from dictatorial to collaborative, and from explanatory to declarative, often find their thoughts and beliefs following suit. They begin to appreciate the positive impact of being authoritative instead of authoritarian, the power of collaborative leadership, and the impact of being definitive and then declarative over excessive explanation (it was the Declaration of Independence, not the Explanation of Independence).
It’s not easy to let go of deeply entrenched thoughts and beliefs, but when we prioritize action and behavior that align with our values, we start to see a change in our internal narrative. And this change, my friends, is transformative. It liberates us from the shackles of limiting beliefs and biases and opens doors to improved performance, better relationships, and ultimately, greater success.
For those of you who eschew “either/or” paradigms because they too often devolve into “zero sum” games, we might do well to add “Polarity Thinking,” an approach pioneered by Barry Johnson. Applying that here, our thoughts, feelings, beliefs, and biases matter and can be closely aligned to the fabric of our being.Andour actions when aligned with the values and conduct of our institutions are also important. (The Few, the Proud, The Marines.)  Polarity “both/and” Thinking would just have us mitigate the downsides of either pole. At one end, don’t allow our thoughts, feelings, beliefs, and biases to contaminate acting according to  agreed upon values and codes of conduct. At the other end, don’t allow our actions to disrupt thoughts, beliefs, feelings, and even biases we hold dear.
So, I encourage you to take a page out of Mulally’s, Goldsmith's, and Johnson’s books, and while you’re at it,readtheir books. Focus on your actions, let them be in sync with your organization's values, and watch as your thoughts, beliefs and feelings start to transform.
After all, in the grand scheme of things, our actions really do speak louder than our thoughts.
However, still allow thoughts, beliefs, and feelings not changed by a change in your actions and that remain special to you inside to remain special to you.
