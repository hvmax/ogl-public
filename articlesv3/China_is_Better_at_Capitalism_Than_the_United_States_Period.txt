### China is Better at Capitalism Than the United States. Period.

20 March 2021|China, Economic Development
AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy and, in particular, life in China. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. We have sought to advance a conversation about the U.S.-China relationship, and a deep understanding of local economic development in China. We have written a series about the strategic strength oflocal economic development in China’s 2nd and 3rd tier citiesandentrepreneurship in China todayas well as a series aboutChina’s Belt and Road Initiative. More recently, we have written aboutChina’s big tech economyand the companies that are changing Chinese society and the world. This post seeks to extend the conversation over our research on the nature of capitalism and economic development in China today. – The Editorial Team
For as long as I have been researching, writing, and teaching about China’s economic reforms, I have been a staunch China Bull. Indeed, years ago, I began one of my books with the statement: “One of the great ironies of our time is that the largest communist polity in the world is also the world’s most dynamic capitalist economy” (China and Globalization, Routledge 2013). So bullish on China’s economic path was I that one reviewer wrote, “Guthrie must be on the payroll of the Beijing Government.” (I am not and never have been.) More recently, theOn Global Leadershipteam has developed a strong position on the success of economic development in China and the successful transition to capitalism there. We are currently working on a book that is tentatively titled,Smart Manufacturing, Smart Cities, Smart Capitalism: The Return of China as the World’s Economic Power.

Recently, I watched my old friend and former colleague, Professor Scott Galloway, on HBO'sReal Time with Bill Maher. In the show, Galloway was, as always, passionate, articulate, and incisive in his analysis. In a question from the host about “crony capitalism,”Galloway replied:
"Capitalism is hands down the best system of its time. What young people are seeing today is not capitalism. We have rugged individualism on the way up and then we have we’re all in this together on the way down, and we have socialism. Capitalism on the way up where five CEOs of airline companies make $150 million bucks, use all their excess cash flow to buy back stock so they can artificially inflate their own compensation, and then shit gets real in a pandemic comes and they don’t have any money and all of a sudden, we’re in this together. When you have capitalism on the way up and you have socialism on the way down, that’s not capitalism or socialism. It is cronyism. It is the worst of all worlds. Capitalism is full-body contact violence at a corporate level so that we can create prosperity and progress that rests on a bed of empathy. We have flipped the script here. We need to be more loving and empathetic with people and more harsh on companies. Capitalism, we should be protecting people not companies. F****** Delta, burn baby burn."
Apparently, this was a summary of an argument Galloway had madebefore. I largely agree with everything he has to say on capitalism in America. Corporations that lobby the federal government for major tax breaks – often in the name of trickle-down economic theory – and then use their newfound wealth for stock-buyback programs are a scourge of the American economic system as well as working and middle-class Americans.
Maher often starts his monologues with his “New Rule” bit, where he comically talks about some topic and all of the absurdities that are laid bare through a close analysis of the topic. The show with Galloway had a New Rule segment focused on China. Maher began: “You are not going to win the battle for the 21st Century if you are a silly people. And Americans are the silly people… Do you know who doesn’t care that there is a caricature of a Chinese man in a Dr. Seuss book? China. All 1.4 billion of them could give a crouching tiger flying f***, because they are not a silly people. If anything, they are as serious as a prison fight.”
He then spent the remaining five minutes of the segment, somewhat ominously, listing all of the astounding infrastructure projects, among other accomplishments, China has been building over the last 40 years, while the United States has descended into culture wars and what Galloway would later in the show call crony capitalism. The segment does a nice job of recounting many of China’s impressive infrastructure and technological feats. He ends with the dark statement, “China is real, and they are eating our lunch. And, believe me, in an hour they will be hungry again.”
I largely agree with everything stated in these two segments. First, I believe Galloway is correct that shareholder capitalism and trickle-down economic theory have run wild in the United States, and that run has largely benefited the wealthy and hurt the middle- and working-classes of American society. There is a reason that, from 1970 to 2020, the middle class share of aggregate income fell from 62% to 43% while the aggregate income of upper income households grew from 29% to 48% over the same period, according to Pew. This is also the reason that the top 1% of US families control an astounding 38.5% of America’s wealth, the highest ratio of anywhere in the world. Crony capitalism indeed.
And let’s talk about China, which is a focus of theOn Global Leadership blog. While Maher is right about all of the accomplishments China has had over the last 40 years, they are presented in an ominous tone. China is coming for us, and they are eating our lunch.
Let us reframe this in the simplest terms: Today, Communist China is better at capitalism and healthy economy development than the United States is. It is just better. Let’s leave aside the terms Communist Party and Democracy aside, and let’s just talk facts and reality.
As we have described in earlierposts,
“Economic development in China is fundamentally shaped by government guidance and centralized control. This has been true since the beginning of the economic reforms, and during the pre-reform era as well. However, while we often think of the Chinese government as the authoritarian, protectionist, centralized party in Beijing, churning out five-year plans and enacting major initiatives such as the Belt and Road Initiative, that is only one side of the government. In reality, local governments at provincial, city, district and county levels are the engines driving China’s powerful system of economic growth. Indeed, the Chinese government is an extremely decentralized and entrepreneurial system of district and township governments. Beyond China’s Central Government, the country is made up of 31 provincial level units – generally large bodies of land (like states in the U.S.), though there are also four provincial-level municipalities included in this group (Beijing, Chongqing, Shanghai, and Tianjin). Below these provincial units are about 800 municipalities, which are segmented into district governments. The mayors of China’s districts and townships behave like corporate CEOs, focusing on KPIs, pursuing foreign investment, and advancing their own careers through the financial and economic achievements in their jurisdictions. It is crucial that their actions and goals line up with the municipalities and provinces under which they reside (and ultimately with the national plans), but they are given discretion and incentives to make they own localities achieve those goals.”
It is a complex system, and it is much more complicated than this short post can depict. It is also through this system that China has accomplished great things and lifted 100 million people out of extreme poverty.  It is through this system that China has risen from an economy on the edge of bankruptcy (GDP $178 billion, 1/15ththe size of the US economy) to the soon-to-be largest economy in the world.
This happens through smart capitalism, which is a process that places people and economic development first (a la Professor Galloway). Because China is a one-party authoritarian system, we often think of it as crony capitalism (a la Russia), but it is not. The system is built on smart capitalism that focuses onentrepreneurialism, theempowerment and incentives of local governments, the smartdevelopment of clusters(see alsohereandhere), the attraction offoreign capital,innovation, the building of a healthyhigh tech sector,going global(see alsohere), the development ofsmart cities, and many other strategies.
As an aside, the United States used to do this well. Indeed, the country’s ability to pull itself out of the Great Depression rode on the back of the Works Project Administration, among other state-driven capitalist policies. The healthiest capitalist economies have a healthy mix of state direction and free market activities.
The United States’ economy started heading south when economist Milton Friedman began to win argument in the 1970s that truly free markets were the only way to run a healthy economy. In the years since the Friedman revolution in economic policy, we have adopted a stance that maintains states and markets as at odds with each other. In China, for the last forty years, there has been a close, coordinated alliance between state and market. It turns out, from a capitalist economic development standpoint, China has managed this process much better than any other large industrialized nation including the United States. It’s not Maher’s crony capitalism; it’s a brand of capitalism we used to practice. It’s a brand of capitalism that made us the economic envy of the world in the 20th century: smart capitalism.
On Global Leadership will keep writing on this topic. Please keep reading.
