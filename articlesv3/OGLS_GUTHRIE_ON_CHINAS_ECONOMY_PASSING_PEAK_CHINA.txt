### OGL'S GUTHRIE ON CHINA’S ECONOMY & PASSING PEAK CHINA

1 March 2024|China, China Population, Economic Development
AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy and, in particular, life in China. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. In this post, OGL'S Doug Guthrie follows our work on the strength of China’s economic development and the way in which Chinese local governments behave like managers in industrial firms (here). In this session, Guthrie participates on a CGTN World Today panel, with host Kun Liu.

Questions Guiding the Panel Discussion:
Some Western analysts have pointed to regulation by the Chinese government as a contributing factor in a growth slowdown. For example, in this November 2023 piece, Greg Ip, Chief Economics Commentator at WSJ wrote: “Starting in 2020, the Communist Party unleashed a regulatory crackdown on private businesses in online commerce, online education and gaming, ostensibly to clamp down on privacy and anticompetitive abuses but mostly to cement its control over the private sector.” Is the Chinese government engaging in micromanagement over critical industries like manufacturing, services, etc? (1)
Another sector in the Chinese economy that Western analysts often cite as evidence of China’s economic decline is the real estate industry. Peter Petri, non-resident fellow at the John L. Thorton China Center at Brookings wrote in this November 2023 piece: “Sales, construction starts, and investments are plummeting, and few major developers will survive without massive bailouts. A large bubble — based on decades of investments chasing fast growth and price rises — is deflating, partly as a result of government policy, and leaves behind stunning examples of overbuilding. And China’s real estate sector is huge, with estimates ranging up to 29% of GDP.” How do we see the current state of China’s real estate market, which is indeed seeing mild performance after a few decades of rapid expansion? How much does this have to do with changes in investment and living preferences among China’s younger generations? (2)
Petri also wrote about what he considered as another structural issue in the Chinese economy, i.e. the relationship between investment and consumption: “China is investing too much in unproductive projects and consuming too little. This is a legacy of the extraordinary 10.5% annual growth between 1990 and 2010, which would not have been possible without very high rates of investment. The problem has been long recognized, but investment today is still 43% of GDP…” Is the transition from an investment-driven economy to a consumption-driven one inevitable for China? (2)
Another factor that western experts tend to focus on when discussing the “Peak China” theory is India surpassing China as the world’s biggest population and China’s first negative birth rate for the in 2022. How do China’s demographic changes factor in to the continued economic development?
One of the external factors that western analysts often say that might pose severe challenge to the Chinese economy is sanctions by the U.S. and its allies in critical sectors such as chips, EV, etc. These analysts argue  sanctions might strangle the Chinese economy because industries involved are often of paramount significance to sustained growth in China. Is the stage already set for the U.S. and China to compete in a decoupled condition? Who will be the victims of this decoupling if it occurs?
Analysts also point to the loans by China in the Belt and Road Initiative as one of the hurdles China might face because of possible defaults from borrowers. On a basic level, how does the BRI influence growth in China?
The Communist Party of China brought about the idea of Chinese Modernization (中国式现代化) in the 20th National Party Congress. In September of 2023, Chinese President Xi Jinping started talking about new productive forces (新质生产力). From these concepts, how do you see the blueprint by Chinese leaders on China’s economy structure moving forward? What will be the main pillars of growth?
What does global competition tell us about today's China? Apart from tourism, what other opportunities are presenting themselves for cities and provinces in China that are transforming from a reliance on heavy industry to high-quality development?
To explore these questions, host Kun Liu. is joined by Dr. Yao Shujie, Chueng Kong Professor of Economics, Chongqing University; Dr. Lauren Johnston, Visiting Senior Lecturer at School of Economics and Policy, University of Adelaide; and Dr. Doug Guthrie, Professor of Global Leadership and Executive Director of China Initiatives at Thunderbird School of Global Management.
