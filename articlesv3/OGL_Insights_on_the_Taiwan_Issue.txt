### OGL Insights on the Taiwan Issue

29 December 2024|China, China history, China politics, Chinese Culture, Geopolitics, Taiwan
On Global Leadership’s regularly does what we like to call a "deep dive" on an important topic of the day. Today, we present our up-to-the-minute insights on a current news event that continues to define the relationship between the United States and China: the status of Taiwan and its sovereignty. We hope this piece from our OGL team members will help illuminate this critical global concern and provide the depth needed to understand the impact of Taiwan's sovereignty on global political, economic, and cultural transitions and transformations.
For decades, the Taiwan question has been at the heart of U.S.-China tensions. It is a volatile and sensitive issue that has the potential to spark direct military conflict between the world's largest powers. While some observers outside China may struggle to grasp Taiwan's critical importance to Beijing, the reality is that the issue involves profound historical, cultural, and geopolitical dimensions.
Here we seek to illuminate the key factors surrounding the Taiwan dispute, fostering dialogue and understanding in the hope of maintaining peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait. These discussions are essential not only for the people of Taiwan and mainland China but for the global community as a whole.
Geopolitical Background: Taiwan’s Unique Position
The Taiwan Strait, a 190-kilometer-wide body of water, separates Taiwan from mainland China, linking the South China Sea to the East China Sea. It serves as a critical maritime corridor and a potential flashpoint for regional conflicts.
In 1949, after the Chinese Civil War, the Nationalist Party (KMT) retreated to Taiwan following their defeat by the Communist Party of China (CPC). This division resulted in two rival governments: the People's Republic of China (PRC) in Beijing and the Republic of China (ROC) in Taipei. Both claimed sovereignty over China as a whole, including Taiwan, leading to decades of ambiguity and tension.
From 1949 to 1979, the international community complicated this fraught relationship. Despite its defeat, the ROC retained China's seat on the United Nations Security Council until 1971. This anomaly persisted until the PRC was officially recognized as China’s legitimate government, shifting diplomatic dynamics significantly. In 1979, the U.S. and China established normalized relations, incorporating the "One China Policy." This policy acknowledges Beijing's claim to Taiwan but leaves Taiwan’s governance largely untouched under a framework of "one country, two systems."
The Roots of Taiwan’s Importance
For outsiders, it may be tempting to dismiss Taiwan as a small island with no bearing on global stability. However, the island's significance to China runs far deeper than its size. From a strategic perspective, Taiwan's location is vital. It sits at the nexus of major sea lanes and is often described as the "unsinkable aircraft carrier" that provides a buffer for China's southeastern coast.
Taiwan’s historical ties to mainland China also play a critical role. The island was under Chinese jurisdiction for over 200 years before being ceded to Japan in 1895 following the Qing dynasty's defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War. After World War II, Taiwan was returned to Chinese sovereignty. The CPC views the island's continued separation as a lingering wound from the “Century of Humiliation,” a period when foreign powers exploited China’s weakness. For many mainland Chinese citizens, Taiwan’s reunification is inextricably linked to national pride and the completion of China’s rejuvenation.
Divergent Identities: Taiwan vs. Mainland China
While Taiwan shares deep historical and cultural roots with mainland China, its political trajectory over the past 75 years has fostered a distinct identity among its people. Today, many Taiwanese identify primarily as Taiwanese rather than Chinese. Public opinion overwhelmingly supports maintaining the status quo as a self-governed entity, with growing support for outright independence.
Moreover, advocates for independence must contend with the overwhelming sentiment in mainland China, where reunification is viewed as a matter of historical justice. Persuading Beijing and the Chinese populace to abandon this goal is an uphill battle, especially given the enduring scars of the "Century of Humiliation."
Beijing views reunification as inevitable and essential. For the Chinese government, relinquishing Taiwan would not only undermine national unity but also jeopardize the CPC’s legitimacy. Any perceived weakness on the Taiwan issue risks emboldening separatist movements elsewhere in China, such as in Tibet or Xinjiang.

Beijing’s refusal to cede Taiwan stems from historical grievances, cultural pride, and strategic imperatives. The separation of Taiwan is seen as a painful legacy of foreign domination and civil war. Reunification is deeply ingrained in the national psyche, transcending the CPC and resonating with the broader Chinese population.
For those who are sympathetic to Beijing's plight, they encourage the Taiwanese to consider Beijing's plea about a divided country. It is not easy to do but only in this way can they understand why Beijing is willing to use the military to stop Taiwan independence. They note it is not so unlike President Lincoln's decision to go to battle when seven southern states declared secession from the Union in the American Civil War.
The Strategic Calculations of Beijing and Washington
Beijing’s stance on Taiwan is both a matter of principle and pragmatism. Politically, Taiwan represents unfinished business from the Chinese Civil War. Militarily, its proximity to the mainland makes it a critical point of defense. Economically, Taiwan is a global leader in semiconductor production, which is vital for contemporary technologies.
The United States has long been a supporter of Taiwan’s security. The Taiwan Relations Act of 1979 commits the U.S. to provide defensive arms to Taiwan while stopping short of guaranteeing direct military intervention. This ambiguous stance—often described as "strategic ambiguity"—is designed to deter both a unilateral declaration of independence by Taiwan and a military invasion by China.
The dynamic between the U.S. and China over Taiwan is fraught with risk. For Beijing, U.S. military support for Taiwan is seen as interference in China’s internal affairs. For Washington, Taiwan is a symbol of democratic resilience and a critical ally in the Indo-Pacific.
Why Many Believe Beijing Shouldn't Let Go
Allowing Taiwan to declare independence would be tantamount to admitting failure in reclaiming all Chinese territories, a cornerstone of Beijing’s political legitimacy since the end of the Chinese Civil War in 1949. Beyond its implications for China's sovereignty, Taiwan's independence would set a dangerous precedent regionally, inspiring other separatist or revolutionary movements with similar aspirations. For instance, groups in Hong Kong, Tibet, and Xinjiang might view Taiwan’s success as a green light to escalate their demands for autonomy or independence, further destabilizing China’s internal cohesion.
Moreover, the precedent could ripple far beyond China, emboldening separatist movements worldwide—such as in Catalonia, Scotland, or Kashmir—potentially leading to a cascade of challenges to existing national borders. This could destabilize regions already fraught with ethnic and political tensions, prompting conflicts that threaten international security.
From Beijing’s perspective, Taiwan’s independence is non-negotiable because it not only undermines China's territorial integrity but also risks unraveling the delicate balance of power in East Asia. The global community could face heightened tensions as other major powers, aligned with separatist causes, become embroiled in disputes that may escalate into broader geopolitical conflicts. In this sense, Taiwan’s separation could set off a chain reaction with far-reaching consequences for the world order.
The Path Forward: Dialogue and Understanding
The Taiwan question is a microcosm of the broader U.S.-China rivalry. As the world's two largest economies, both nations have much to lose from a military confrontation. Maintaining peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait is paramount, not only for the region but for the global community.
Dialogue and mutual understanding are essential. Both sides must acknowledge the other’s historical and cultural perspectives while prioritizing practical solutions to de-escalate tensions. Taiwan, for its part, should seek ways to engage constructively with Beijing without compromising its democratic values. Similarly, Beijing must recognize that coercion will only deepen Taiwan’s resolve to remain separate.
For the United States, balancing support for Taiwan with the imperative of avoiding direct conflict with China will require nuanced diplomacy. Strategic ambiguity has served as a stabilizing force thus far, but it may require adjustments as the regional and global landscape evolves.
The Complex Dynamics of Taiwan and Mongolia
China’s modern history, shaped by external interventions and internal challenges, is marked by the loss of territories during the so-called Century of National Humiliation. Among these, the independence of Outer Mongolia, which illustrate the intersection of historical grievances, international politics, and cultural ties. Examining this case sheds light on Beijing's contrasting approaches to these two regions and their implications for contemporary geopolitics.
From 1911 to 1946, the weakening of China’s national strength, coupled with Tsarist Russia’s and the Soviet Union’s interventions, paved the way for Outer Mongolia’s independence. By 1946, the ROC formally recognized Mongolia's sovereignty, further cemented in 1961 when the ROC abstained from vetoing Mongolia’s United Nations membership. (1) The PRC also established diplomatic ties with Mongolia shortly after its inception in 1949.
Despite fleeting attempts by Mao Zedong to reclaim Outer Mongolia, Soviet leaders firmly rejected the overtures, underscoring Mongolia’s status as an independent sovereign state and a UN member. The practical and political realities of the time rendered its return to China implausible, embedding Mongolia’s independence as an "irreparable scar" in China’s modern history.
The divergence in Beijing’s treatment of Mongolia and Taiwan lies in both historical circumstances and emotional resonance. Mongolia’s independence resulted from a combination of external pressure and internal weakness during a turbulent period in China’s history. Its ethnic and cultural distinctiveness further softened the blow of its loss.
Conversely, Taiwan’s shared heritage with the Mainland and its strategic importance evoke a deeper attachment. For Beijing, Taiwan represents not just a historical grievance but a litmus test for its territorial integrity and international stature. And global powers have largely weighed in on Beijing's side.
In contrast to Mongolia, Taiwan holds a unique position in Chinese consciousness. While Mongolia’s population is ethnically and culturally distinct, Taiwan shares linguistic, historical, and cultural ties with the Mainland. This connection is encapsulated in the words of former Taiwanese President Ma Ying-jeou, who described the two sides as sharing a “common inheritance of blood, language, history, and culture.”
The mutual trust between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait is built on the “1992 Consensus,” reached on November 7, 1992, in Hong Kong, where representatives of the Taiwan-based Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) and the Mainland-based Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) agreed that “both sides of the Taiwan Strait adhere to the “One China” principle, with each side verbally expressing the interpretation.”(2)
Since the victory of Chen Shui-bian in 2000, the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) has won five out of seven presidential elections of Taiwan. DPP refused to recognize the cross-strait positioning outlined in the Constitution of the Republic of China and rejected the “1992 Consensus,” which serves as the common political foundation between the two sides. In response, the Mainland refused to allow Taiwan to participate in international organizations that it was able to during the Ma Ying-jeou Administration (2008-2016), seized Taiwan’s diplomatic allies, and conducted military exercises around Taiwan. This has exacerbated cross-strait tensions, with Beijing curtailing Taiwan’s international participation and conducting military exercises to reinforce its stance.
The "One China" Principle & Global Ramifications
The concept of "One China" is central to the PRC’s legitimacy and forms the basis of international relations concerning Taiwan. The term "China" historically evolved as a generic identifier for the nation, its people, and its culture, solidified by international treaties and modern state-building efforts.
Here “China” (or “中国”) is a generic term, referring to the nation or country, populace and territory in the land of eastern Asia, and includes the historical, cultural, political and other inheritance. Since the end of the Ming Dynasty and the beginning of the Qing Dynasty, no matter how China changed dynasties, the West kept calling it China (or Chine, Cina). The formal and widespread use of the name “China” in a series of national decrees and state-issued textbooks in the late Qing Dynasty, plus its use and recognition in international treaties, established the legitimacy of “China” as a modern country name, it also laid the foundation for the “Chinese” including all ethnic groups as the national identity of contemporary China.
Follow this logic, the Cairo Declaration, jointly released by the United States, the Republic of China and Great Britain on December 1, 1943, stated that territories taken from China by Japan, including Manchuria, Taiwan, and the Pescadores, would be returned to the control of the Republic of China after the conflict ended. However, the subsequent division of China and the rise of the PRC introduced a duality in interpreting what constitutes "China."
The United States’ approach to the Taiwan issue reflects a deliberate strategy of ambiguity. Under the “One China Policy,” Washington maintains formal diplomatic relations with Beijing while fostering unofficial ties with Taipei. Codified in the Taiwan Relations Act, U.S. policy supports Taiwan’s defense capabilities without explicitly committing to its military protection.
This policy aims to preserve the fragile status quo across the Taiwan Strait, balancing support for Taiwan’s autonomy with recognition of Beijing’s sovereignty claims. Yet, as Taiwan emerges as a flashpoint in U.S.-China relations, the boundaries of this ambiguity face increasing strain.
The Risks of Redefining Taiwan as an Independent State
Casting Taiwan as an independent sovereign state akin to Ukraine risks destabilizing the region and undermining the “One China” framework that underpins global relations with Beijing. Such a shift could provoke severe geopolitical repercussions, challenging the delicate balance that has preserved peace across the Taiwan Strait.
The analogy to Ukraine, often drawn in light of recent conflicts, oversimplifies the Taiwan issue. Unlike Ukraine, Taiwan’s sovereignty remains unrecognized by most countries, and its status is deeply intertwined with historical, cultural, and geopolitical considerations unique to the region.
The cases of Mongolia and Taiwan underscore the complexities of sovereignty and identity in modern geopolitics. For China, Mongolia represents a painful but accepted loss, while Taiwan remains a deeply contested issue with profound implications for regional stability and global diplomacy.
The international community’s handling of Taiwan requires a nuanced understanding of its historical and cultural context, as well as a recognition of the delicate interplay between principle and pragmatism. As cross-strait tensions escalate, maintaining the status quo may be the most viable path to preserving peace and stability in East Asia.
In the English text of the communiqué on the establishment of diplomatic relations, the language noted that the United States “recognizes the Government of the People’s Republic of China as the sole legal Government of China”, “acknowledges the Chinese position that there is but one China and Taiwan is part of China”.
The difference between “RECOGNIZE” and “ACKNOWLEDGE” underscores the intention to blur the concepts in question, thus allowing different interpretations in the future. In the Chinese text, “承认”stands for both “RECOGNIZE” and “ACKNOWLEDGE”. The meaning of “承认” is closer to “RECOGNIZE”. Since the communiqué on the establishment of diplomatic relations is a formal diplomatic/legal document which the two governments should sign and exchange documents in both languages, both sides should check the accuracy to make sure that the texts are completely symmetrical.
Both Beijing and Washington recognized the existence of some degree of ambiguity when the communiqué was signed, which is easier to understand considering that 1979 was still in the period of the Cold War.
Similar ambiguity and tolerance of Beijing can be seen from the text of the communiqué on the establishment of diplomatic relations between PRC and other countries during the Cold War period. For example, In China-Canada Communiqué signed in1970 we see the following text:
The Chinese Government reaffirms that Taiwan is an inalienable part of the territory of the People’s Republic of China. The Canadian Government takes note of this position of the Chinese Government.
However, for an international organization like the United Nations, where sovereign state status is required, Beijing’s position towards Taiwan is very strict. In October 1971, the 26th session of the United Nations General Assembly adopted Resolution 2758, which undertook “to restore all its rights to the People’s Republic of China and to recognize the representatives of its government as the only legitimate representatives of China to the United Nations.” Based on the Resolution 2758, “Taiwan” is a province of China with no separate status. Only with Beijing’s permission can Taiwan participate in the activities of relevant international organizations like World Health Organization (WHO) under the name “Chinese Taipei”.
In recent years, Beijing has accused Washington for “eroding” the one-China policy on Taiwan by questioning China’s sovereignty over Taiwan, whether it’s House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visiting Taiwan and meeting with Taiwan’s leaders, or statements from U.S. politicians e.g. the president or secretary of state, that are inconsistent with its one-China policy. As countermeasures, Beijing has started exercising jurisdiction over waters surrounding Taiwan through the Chinese Coast Guard, a strategy to safeguard sovereignty over Taiwan by implementing governance.
The Future of Taiwan
In May 2024, Lai Ching-Te or William Lai, who supported Taiwan’s independence, was sworn as the new President of ROC. In November, Donald Trump who has been tough on Beijing, won the U.S. presidential election. All these suggest that the next four years will be full of uncertainties in the relations between the Taiwan Strait and US-China relations.
There has considerable speculation about the PRC starting a war to reunify with Taiwan, the year 2027 within the next Trump presidency is frequently mentioned. Will Trump’s election increase such a likelihood?
The next four years will be full of uncertainties, and will become more complicated, but we do not know how it will evolve. But we don’t believe that Beijing will proactively take military action on Taiwan in the next term of the US government.
Beijing’s preference has always been to achieve peaceful reunification with the island, but that it would not rule out the use of force. China’s Anti-Secession Law, effective from March 14, 2005, stipulates three scenarios in which non-peaceful means and other necessary measures shall be employed to protect China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity:
“Taiwan independence” secessionist forces should act under any name or by any means to cause the fact of Taiwan’s secession from China, orMajor incidents entailing Taiwan’s secession from China should occur, orPossibilities for a peaceful reunification should be completely exhausted.
• “Taiwan independence” secessionist forces should act under any name or by any means to cause the fact of Taiwan’s secession from China, or
• Major incidents entailing Taiwan’s secession from China should occur, or
• Possibilities for a peaceful reunification should be completely exhausted.
The first two trigger points correspond to situations that may occur in the short to medium period, e.g., provocative trips by high-ranking U.S. officials to Taiwan; arms sales to Taiwan which would seriously affect the security of the Mainland like submarines, medium-range missiles or an independence referendum in Taiwan , etc. The third one is more about dealing with uncertainties in the future.
While Beijing is hoping for the best while preparing for the worst, “military readiness” wouldn’t prompt the Mainland to attack.
Beijing believes that with the development of the Mainland, the increasing disparity in the balance of power between the two sides of the strait, and the narrowing of the power gap between China and the United States, the future of cross-strait relation is beneficial to the Mainland side. Therefore, official documents of the Mainland have repeatedly described situation as “firmly grasping the dominance and initiative in cross-strait relations” and Beijing’s policy has also been shifting from opposing Taiwan independence to promoting reunification. Now it is reasonable to ask how long is China prepared to wait to reunify Taiwan?
If the goals set out at the 20th CPC National Congress are achieved,  China’s GDP will surpass that of the United States by 2035, and about twice that of the United States by 2049. Based on this calculation, we predict that the period from 2035 to 2049 will be the window where China likely seeks to reunify with Taiwan.
During their meeting in April 2024 in Beijing, China President Xi Jinping told Taiwan President Ma Ying-jeou that as long as both sides of the Taiwan Strait recognize themselves as part of the Chinese nation, anything can be discussed. China is a great civilization with a long history and a splendid culture. The Chinese should have the wisdom to resolve Taiwan question peacefully for the well-being for people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait.
