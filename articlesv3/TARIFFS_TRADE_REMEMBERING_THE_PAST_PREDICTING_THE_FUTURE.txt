### TARIFFS & TRADE: REMEMBERING THE PAST & PREDICTING THE FUTURE

23 April 2025|China, China history, China politics, Geopolitics
At On Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy and, in particular, life in China. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. We have written about economic development in China and China’s economic reforms, U.S.-China relations, China’s changing role in the global political economy, and the history and current state of Chinese politics. With the rising trade tensions between China and the United States, China’s role globally and, in particular, its role in the world is of growing concern to China hawks in the United States. We believe history and culture matter here; history and culture matter deeply and these issues resonate deeply with the Chinese people and with Chairman Xi Jinping. U.S. politicians and diplomats would do well to spend some time thinking about this history. In this article, the OGL team places the current trade war in the historical and cultural landscape of China today.
As we watch the Trump-driven trade war debacle unfolding between China and the United States, it is interesting and important to see how little our two nations – the world’s two largest economies – are understanding (and misunderstanding) each other. In the United States, we have a narcissistic president who either does not understand the basic economics of trade and tariffs, or he and his team simply do not care (corrupt market manipulation, anyone?). We have written about these issues previously (see, for example,here,here,here, andhere).
However, as scholars of the Chinese political economy, we believe it is still important to share with our readers our understanding of Chinese history and culture to better understand this moment.
When we teach about Chinese economic development, we always begin with the following mantra: “When you leave this class, we want you to leave with three core theoretical edifices: History and culture matter; local political economy matters; and geopolitical dynamics matter. No matter how talented of an economist you are, you cannot understand what is going on in the global stage without understanding history, culture, local politics, and geopolitics.”
History and culture matter, so let’s turn the history and culture lens on China in today’s tariff and trade war for a moment.
China President and Chairman Xi Jinping must be viewed and understood in the context of the history and culture from which he emerged. Years ago, we wrote about Xi and his resemblance to an historical leader six centuries earlier: “Xi Jinping as Emperor Yongle” (here).
“When Xi Jinping looks in the mirror, he sees Emperor Yongle staring back at him. Emperor Yongle was the Second Emperor of the Ming Dynasty and was the last ruler of China when the Middle Kingdom was the most powerful nation on earth. During Emperor Yongle’s reign, China controlled about one-third of the global GDP and had naval fleet far larger and more technologically advanced than any in the world," we wrote.
This was a time when China had, for over 1,000 years, been the most innovative economy in the world, inventing and producing such world-changing inventions as the nautical compass, silk, paper, the printing press (no, Johannes Gutenberg, this was *not* you… you got it from China via the Silk Road.), and, yes, gun powder, the war-waging powder that Europe used to subjugate and colonize the rest of the world, including China. These were all Chinese inventions. It was a time when China had the world’s largest armada with maritime technology that Europe would not see for three decades. It was a time when China occupied about one-third of the global economy.
And then there was decline and crisis. In the 16th, 17th, and 18th Centuries, China built walls (the Ming Wall) and stagnated while the West sped ahead. China’s decline hit its nadir with the First Opium War (1839-41).
At this point, a critical moment in China history, Hong Kong became a British colony as a consequence of the First Opium War. In the early 19th century, Britain was exporting significant quantities of opium into China, which created widespread social and economic problems. In response, the Qing Dynasty banned the opium trade. Britain, seeking to protect its commercial interests, engaged in military conflict with China. Following Britain's victory in the war, the Treaty of Nanking was signed in 1842. As part of this treaty, China ceded Hong Kong to Britain.
And that was just the beginning of what would become known as the “Century of Humiliation” (百年国耻, 1839-1949). During this period, following the First Opium War (1839-42), there was the Second Opium War (1856-60), the Sino-Japanese War (1895), the fall of the Qing Dynasty (1911), the Warlord Period (1916-28), the Rape of Nanking (1937). This was a deeply, deeply embarrassing time for this once powerful, proud nation. It was a devastating century for China.
This period was also marked by inspiring moments like the May 4th Student Movement of 1919, Deng Xiaoping’s trip to France to “learn knowledge and truth from the West in order to save China,” the rise of the brilliant writer Lu Xun, and many others. Also, out of this period, came the populist, authoritarian leader, Mao Zedong.
Yet China did not regain power, greatness, and global influence during this period. Instead, China suffered more embarrassing, catastrophic policies and losses. The chaos of life under Mao produced: the “Anti-Campaigns” of the 1950s, which were campaigns of social control through terror; the Great Famine of 1959-61, in which 50 million people died of starvation due to Mao’s errant economic policies; and the Cultural Revolution (1966-76), which further entrenched Mao’s reign of terror.  These were dark times for the once-powerful nation.
But culture is a resilient thing, and Mao’s reign was perhaps more of a disruption than a total transformation of the culture and society. If structural circumstances were to swing back in favor of fostering trade and economic development, it is not difficult to imagine how the cultural attributes that made China the most innovative and entrepreneurial nation on earth, might re-emerge. And that is exactly what happened. For 140 years, the oppression from the West, Japan, and the extreme totalitarian government of Mao’s Communist China, left people unclear and terrified by entrepreneurial activity.
In 1979, the world changed for Chinese citizens, and there were several forces that contributed to this change. In 1979, Deng traveled to the United States to normalize relations and open trade with the United States. Then there was the attraction of foreign capital to China in the 1980s and 1990s and China’s entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2001, under the leadership of Chinese leaders Zhu Rongjin and Jiang Zemin in the 1990s, and China’s opening to the world in the 2000s under Hu Jintao and Wen Jiabao.
China studied, learned, attracted foreign investment, and built the most powerful manufacturing supply chain in the world. In the aforementioned article, we furtherwrote, “At some point in the next few years, China will surpass the United States as the largest economy in the world. With the United States’ exit from the Transpacific Partnership (TPP), there is no country that has more influence in Asia than China does. And, as a nuclear power with the largest standing military in the world, it would not be surprising if Xi was indeed seeing this as the moment to reclaim its position as world leader. It is a somewhat jarring irony of our time that, while the United States abandons multilateral engagements, Xi is quietly (or not so quietly) positioning himself as the global leader on matters from environmental sustainability to free trade, not to mention the control of much of the Global South through the Belt and Road Initiative.”
It may very well be the case that Xi, believing himself to be a man of destiny, understands this moment as the time in which China will reclaim its rightful position as world leader. So, it is in this context, that we see the emergence of the calm, authoritarian Xi.
Very early in his tenure, he began giving signals to the foreign business community that things would not be the same on his watch. Yes, with China’s entry into the WTO, the country could no longer have a quid pro quo for market access. But on his first day in office, Xi would signal to the companies operating in China that they were going to have to give back.
Inaugurated on March 14, 2013, one of Xi's first acts set the stage for his tenure. Two days later, on China’s annual “World Consumer Rights Day,” Apple, one of the world’s most profitable companies, was called out. In a coordinated campaign by state-run media outlets, China attacked the iPhone maker for its poor consumer practices. The onslaught was eventually defused when Apple CEO Tim Cook apologized over "warranty confusion." Two years later, in the country’s 2015 Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) report, Apple was called out again. And in late 2015, China’s labor laws would be changed in significant ways that would force Apple to comply with Xi's demands again.
For two thousand years, when China was the most innovative and entrepreneurial nation in the world, the culture fostered a society in which individuals, families, and clans saw the government as a distant, attenuated force in their lives. Chinese people were not dependent upon the State but rather sought to build their own lives independent of state control. Indeed, the famous Chinese saying, “Heaven is high and the Emperor is far away” (tiangao huangdi yuan,天高皇帝远), sometimes remembered as “The mountains are high and the Emperor is far away” (shangao huangdi yuan, 山高皇帝远), captured the sentiment: “the Emperor [Central Government] may be close to heaven, but the Emperor does not control us; the mountains are high and the emperor is far away; we can do what we want; and we covet our independence from state control.”
A historically and culturally nuanced geopolitical shift has been unfolding for the last four decades. When Xi assumed power in 2013, it was evident that he aimed to signal China's resurgence, not merely as a regional power, but as a dominant global economic force no longer beholden to external influences, particularly Western corporations. Xi’s ascent marked the beginning of China’s assertive reassertion on the world stage, positioning itself as a leader in innovation and economic might.
This trajectory was met with resistance during Trump’s first term, most notably through the imposition of $300 billion in tariffs on Chinese goods in 2018, initiating a contentious phase in U.S.-China relations. Under President Biden, tensions appeared to ease, with a measured recalibration of the relationship. However, by 2025, the reintroduction of aggressive tariff policies under a renewed Trump administration signaled a return to economic confrontation.
Will Xi cave to Trump’s tariff craziness? Probably not. Xi will likely stay calm and stick to his plan, continue to pivot China away from a reliance on and partnership with the U.S. economy. China has known bullies in the past. Culture and history matter.
Our OGL team has been predicting a pivot over the last two years, and in our analysis of The Chinese Playbook, we believe this is coming to fruition now. However, we also think Trump's actions on tariffs and his belligerence about China have accelerated this process. We will all have to see where this goes.
