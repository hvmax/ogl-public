### U.S. v. China: Space Exploration

29 July 2024|China, OGL Versus, US-China Relations
AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy and, in particular, life in China. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. We have sought to advance a conversation about the U.S.-China relationship. In our latest feature, OGL Versus, we write about interesting parallels we see between the U.S. and China, and offer some additional readings to take this conversation to even deeper levels. Our focus is giving you an abridged version of a fascinating subject and pointing you toward more information. As always, we enjoy looking at how the two nations are addressing issues -- both large and small -- from two very different perspectives and often with two very different approaches. In our inaugural post, we briefly discuss space exploration and competition.
When it comes to space exploration, the United States might have a multi-decade lead on China, but China is moving swiftly to catch up with ground-breaking programs to land astronauts on the moon and set up a moon research base.
And the payoff for this competition is no longer just bragging rights about who got there first, but rather the control of valuable natural resources that can be found in space and the ability to grasp the "higher" ground in earth-bound military skirmishes. Both countries are heavily investing in their space programs with distinct strategic objectives.
China Advancing Quickly in Space
When China’s leader Deng Xiaoping came to the United States to normalize relations in 1979, he wanted to visit three cities along with Washington, D.C., as he considered how to plot China’s transformation and future. The city visits and tours had purpose: understand consumer economics (Coca Cola in Atlanta); comprehend the ins and outs of complex manufacturing (Boeing in Seattle); and consider how to drive space exploration (NASA in Houston).
The lessons took, of course. Remarkably, China launched a prototype space lab, Tiangong 1, in 2011. In June 2012, Shenzhou 9 carried three astronauts to the space lab for a two-week stay. A year later, three more crew members visited Tiangong 1 for two weeks on the Shenzhou 10 mission.
In May 2024, China launched the Chang’e-6 probe, an uncrewed lunar mission to bring back samples from the far side of the moon for the first time. A major step forward in China’s effort to become a global space power and to land astronauts on the moon by 2030 and to build a research station at its south pole. Along with an active space station, China has launched numerous satellites, including military ones.
U.S. Commercializing Space
Part of the reason the competition has become so fierce is that commercial space operations have become a popular focus of space exploration in the last few decades. As private companies began looking beyond the earth's orbit for commercial opportunities, the character of space investments in the United States have changed.
Nearly two decades ago, NASA started investing in commercial space companies such as Space X to seed the future companies that would drive the space race. In 2008, NASA gave SpaceX a multi-billion dollar contract to fly cargo and people to the International Space Station (ISS). Without that investment, and many more over the years, Space X might have gone bankrupt, and it wouldn't be the private powerhouse that serves many government agencies today.
Meanwhile, NASA is working to maintain its leadership in space through NASA's Artemis program, which hopes to return astronauts to the Moon by 2029. Despite delays and budgetary challenges, there is a strong push from both NASA and Congress to ensure the U.S. maintains its historic lead in lunar exploration.
The United States is also focused on resource-heavy programs that demand a long period of investment and research, or have little promise of a payoff to interest private companies. Examples of these types of programs are NASA's mission to send a spacecraft to Pluto, or land a rover on Mars to search for life.
At a Strategic Advantage
Both nations are treating space as a critical domain for national security and strategic advancement. The U.S. Space Force seeks to enhance its space capabilities to counteract what it perceives as threats from Chinese and Russian space-based weapons. China and the U.S. both are working to deploy next-generation satellites, hardening their defenses and leveraging with private sector innovators​ advance their programs.
Winning the space race in the 21st century is important for several reasons that span scientific, economic, technological, and geopolitical dimensions, including:
Technological Advancement: Space exploration drives innovation in materials science, robotics, AI, telecommunications, and more.Economic Opportunities: Leading in space technology can provide economic benefits and create new industries and jobs.National Security: Dominance in space ensures a strategic advantage in both defense and intelligence in satellite-based surveillance, navigation and communication systems.Scientific Discovery: Discoveries show the potential for life beyond Earth and enhance understanding of fundamental science.
