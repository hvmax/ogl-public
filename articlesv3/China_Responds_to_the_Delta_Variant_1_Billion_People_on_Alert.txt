### China Responds to the Delta Variant: 1 Billion People on Alert

13 August 2021|China, Coronavirus, Leadership
AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy and, in particular, life in China. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. Our in-depth research often focuses on how China deals with problems, particularly COVID-19, and how it has successfully maneuvered through the pandemic through thorough testing, aggressive tracking, and voluntary changes by the general public. We have written several essays,hereandhere, analyzing China’s progress in dealing with the pandemic over the 18 months, and this post continues that work as it examines the recent rise of the Delta variant. – The Editorial Team.

It was bound to happen. The COVID-19 Delta variant has made it to China, jumping the “fence” that metaphorically surrounds the 12 airports that host arriving international flights. No day goes by without a report of an inbound infection, averaging more than five new cases daily across the country.
Of course, outbreaks do happen. Some found by random testing at hospitals, airports, schools, and other public institutions. Throughout the year, different locales had outbreaks of the original variant. Yunnan province has an ongoing struggle controlling cases that “walk” across the border from Burma. Tracking and tracing begins almost immediately when a potential case shows up. No matter if the numbers are 100, 500, or in the thousands, testing is done within hours. A city of 10 million could be completely tested within days. The outbreak is controlled to its location. The entire country is riveted by the news, knowing that within 14 days, if the system works, COVID-19 will be contained, the crisis passes, and the country responds with a collective sigh of relief.
Tom Fowdy, a British political and international relations analyst, noted that in the last 19 months, China's people "knew what to do to prevent the spread of disease and did not take unnecessary risks. This, of course, complimented measures taken by authorities and thus enabled an 'all society' response to combating the virus." Fowdy argued that the West is incapable of seeing the Chinese people as independent and informed thinkers who have made decisions about how best to protect their own health. "Pride and ideology are making it so that the worse the situation becomes in the West, the more difficult it is becoming for some to acknowledge that China did well," noted Fowdy.
International observers posit that China is "special", meaning administered by an authoritarian government, so people have no choice but to follow the rules and respond more quickly to the virus. The principle that ordinary folks are willing to trade off freedom and choice for health and security seems foreign to outsiders. China has over 3,500 years of collective memory that social stability and safety trumps chaos every single time. Why is it so difficult to appreciate China would follow the same path through the pandemic? How China is dealing with the Delta variant today is a reminder of the country-wide response required to address a virulent pandemic. The work continues unabated here.
Outbreaks Emerging
The recent outbreak in Nanjing was different. The epicenter of the outbreak at Nanjing Lukou International Airport, the international airport servicing Jiangsu Province and surrounding areas, handles some 28 million passengers. The first 17 infections were discovered among cleaning staff at the airport on July 20, 2021. By July 21, residential communities were going into lockdown as the entire city of 9 million was tested. A sense of urgency settled over the city, with repeated testing, sometimes twice or three times a day, identifying new cases.
Nanjing Lukou International Airport that was the source of the current outbreak of the COVID-19 Delta variant. Currently the airport is closed off to arriving flights.

Meanwhile, authorities confirmed the rumors that the culprit was Air China flight CA910, which had departed Moscow July 9, 2021, for Nanjing. The nine-person crew cleaning the aircraft in Nanjing was infected after “non-standard protection” or not following protocol. The flight had only one COVID-positive case among the passengers. One week later, on July 28, the Delta variant had spread to 15 cities in seven provinces, with a total of 173 cases. As of August 11, the government announced there were 21 high-risk and 199 medium-risk areas, with a reported 828 cases. The impact was felt far and wide, from Liaoning to Guangdong to Chengdu. And the numbers are still growing.
Shanghai in one of those lucky-unlucky moments escaped local transmission. Only three hours away from the cases erupting in Nanjing, the forecasted typhoon Lifa was heading for Shanghai and caused train stations and airports to close down for four days, effectively discouraging travelers. By cutting off the transmission route to Shanghai, the city was able to battle the widespread flooding and wind damage without the Delta variant threat.
On July 21 a 64-year-old woman named Mao departed for Yangzhou, the historical city about 100 kilometers east of Nanjing. While her residential neighborhood went into lockdown for testing, she was able to slip the net, traveling by bus to visit her sister and played mahjong at local entertainment halls. These were not typical small parlors, but large one with100 tables of four people each. With staff and players, there could be 600 people in one facility. Allowing for the incubation period, the outbreak erupted on July 28 with 98 reported cases. As of August 12, there were 510 cases in Yangzhou, with more than 30 cases showing up daily, and that number is not declining.

Government officials concede there are issues with weak control measures, poor communications across provinces, and poor management at testing sites. A new breakout was found in Zhangjiajie in the Hunan province where a tourist group of 67 from Jiangsu Province came into contract with the Delta variant and carried back the disease back to Huai’An. Who was responsible for allowing large crowds to continue gathering for the Grand Performance on July 29, nine days after the Nanjing outbreak was announced? The outbreak had supposedly shut the entire region down. More than 10,000 tourists were stalled in the area, and only allowed to return home after three negative nucleic test reports. Now Wuhan, the epicenter of COVID-19 Round 1, has seven local cases, the first since June 2020.
It‘s obvious mistakes were made at the management level, and in China, that means  responsibility must be assigned. The Linkou Airport management team, lead by Feng Jun, is being investigated to ensure it was doing its job and not slacking off. Meanwhile, testing sites are usually manned by volunteers to ensure individuals queuing up are properly distanced and not getting infected while standing in line, which happened in Yangzhou.
Further, there are consequences if one deliberately evades the epidemic emergency protocols, as was the case of Ms. Mao who is now under investigation by the police in Yangzhou for hiding her itinerary. She is alleged to be personally responsible for causing the COVID flare up in Yangzhou, which is spreading fast among the elderly.
New Variant, New Rules
All over China the rules that have been in place since January 2020 are being reinforced. Shanghai never stopped requiring masks on public transportation. One can hear an announcement on the metro: “Thank you for your cooperation but please wear a mask.” This will be repeated as many times as it takes for whoever must adjust or put on his or her mask. As one moves about the city, one can feel a heightened tension as doors to malls are blocked again, and travelers are required to show their travel codes, which can track which cities one has visited in the last 14 days. Green is the favored color every day.
“Show your travel code” is announced as one boards buses, metros, and airlines, or when entering hospitals, government offices, banks, schools and others.

The fall school semester is around the corner, and everyone expects updated rules for returning to the classroom. Parents will comply as they want their children and their classmates to be safe. Shanghai starts vaccinating teens between the ages of 15 and 17 this week, and gradually will move on to younger ages. And there are no excuses: no vaccine, no school.
There are many cases of citizens self-reporting, often immediately if it turns out they have been to the same place that a confirmed COVID-19 patient visited. And people do decide for themselves to get a COVID-19 test for peace of mind.
All this compliance doesn't mean that people aren’t impatient with residential lockdowns and other epidemic management steps. "The spread of the epidemic in many provinces has caused great public anxiety about the uncertainty of the future," Prof. Zhang WenHong wrote on his Weibo social media account.
Watching the horror show abroad, where COVID-19 runs rampant, no one wants that to happen here. China led the way in implementing and refining procedures to identify the source of transmission through thorough testing and tracking, and controlling the mobility of the general population. China's people know the virus must be contained in order to keep the economy open. While there is a certain level of stress, there is also a confidence born of the success of the past 19 months, which have resulted in a collaborative partnership between the government and its citizens.
