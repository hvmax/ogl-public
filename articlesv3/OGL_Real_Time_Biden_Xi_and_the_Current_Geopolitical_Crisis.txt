On Global Leadership's feature, OGL Real Time, presents our up-to-the-minute insights on current news and events. We hope these breaking news insights from our OGL team members will help illuminate the events of the day and provide the depth needed to understand global political, economic and cultural transitions and transformations. This post explores the dialogue occurring inside of China surrounding China’s engagement with Russia, China’s engagement with the United States, and how the G2 will together navigate the current geopolitical crisis.

On March 18, President Biden spoke by video for two hours with Chinese President Xi Jinping, laying out the consequences of China providing military or economic aid to support Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The virtual face-to-face call was not the turning point Biden may have hoped for, with the post-call Chinese government readout noting that Xi told Biden: “He who tied the bell to the tiger must take it off."
As China watchers, we have been waiting for this moment for some time. Indeed, at On Global Leadership, we have written about and anticipated this moment (e.g.,here,here, andhere). The key questions right now are: (1) what was the result from the U.S. perspective; and (2) how is it playing in China? It is still early days, but there are some clear indications surfacing.

On the U.S. side, Biden administration Press Secretary Jen Psaki described the call as a loss or, at best, a push. “China has to make a decision for themselves, about where they want to stand and how they want the history books to look at them and view their actions," said Psaki.
This approach plays well in the United States where most Americans cannot understand why China isn't moved by the plight of the Ukrainians to intervene with Russia. But then most Americans are not familiar with the path of strategic autonomy that nations like China and India are choosing, as they refuse to line up compliantly in conflicts between the East and the West.
In fact, China isn't in the mood to be lectured right now. It might be interested in being brought into the fold as a leading nation in the world, but there is no interest in China for being pushed around by the West. Pundits like Fareed Zakaria like to bluster about the U.S.’s ability to “punish” China. Yet China also has the ability to “punish” the United States. As we have writtenpreviously, companies like Apple, Tesla, Walmart, Home Depot and many others have deep investments there and will hurt deeply from an economic Cold War.
OGL’s Doug Guthrie posed several questions to OGL’s on-the-ground team in China to get a sense of the call's import and impact there.
1.What is the mood in China following the Biden-Xi meeting?
First, let’s compare this meeting to Biden and Xi’s first video conference in November 2021. The U.S.-China relationship, long fraught, has only become more strained. We can see this clearly by comparing the photos provided by Xinhua News Agency for the two video conferences between Joe Biden and Xi Jinping. In the second meeting, held on March 18, Xi showed a serious expression and the U.S. national flag was removed. Yet, we could see the national flags of France and Germany when Xi had a virtual meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz 10 days earlier.
Further, in an attempt to show international support for China’s position, state broadcaster CCTV said Xi discussed Ukraine in phone calls with South African President Cyril Ramaphosa and Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen, adding that the leaders’ views were “extremely close.” (South Africa was one of 35 countries to abstain from the 141-5 passage of the United Nations General Assembly resolution demanding Russia withdraw from Ukraine. Cambodia voted for the resolution.)
These issues are symbolic, but the symbolism has meaning. Whether it is the stern look of the Chinese President or the absence of an American flag, it is clear that the Chinese tone has changed vis-à-vis America.
A few more summary points about the call: with respect to Taiwan, China got what it wanted, which was to have Biden spell out again the One-China Policy regarding Taiwan (one China, no one changes status quo, U.S. not supporting Taiwan's independence). If the U.S. abides by this policy, which dates back to the Shanghai Communique in 1972, China then will consider helping the U.S. While the West believes China is looking for excuses to take over Taiwan, the view in China is that the government is searching for reasons to not fight that battle. U.S. affirmation of the One-China Policy affirms that approach.
2.Are there any specific memes on Chinese social media that capture what Chinese people are thinking about the Biden-Xi meeting?
China released information about the talk when the meeting was still going on at 10:04 p.m. Beijing time, one hour after the meeting started, and a complete press release at 11:44 p.m. This paragraph in Mandarin was seen on Chinese social media as the most important message from China:
习近平指出. 目前. 中美关系还没有走出美国上一届政府制造的困境. 反而遭遇了越来越多的挑战. 特别是美国一些人向“台独”势力发出错误信号. 这是十分危险的. 台湾问题如果处理不好，将会对两国关系造成颠覆性影响. 希望美方予以足够重视. 中美关系之所以出现目前的局面，直接原因是美方一些人没有落实我们两人达成的重要共识,也没有把总统先生的积极表态落到实处.美方对中方的战略意图做出了误读误判.
Translation:  Xi Jinping pointed out that, current China- U.S. relations, instead of getting out of the predicament created by the previous U.S. administration, yet has encountered more and more challenges. In particular, some people in the U.S. have sent wrong signals to the 'Taiwan independence' movement. This is very dangerous. If the Taiwan issue is not handled properly, it will have a subversive impact on the bilateral relationship, and China hopes that the U.S. will give due attention to this issue. The direct cause for the dilemma of current China-U.S. relations is that some people on the U.S. side have not followed through on the important common understanding reached by the two presidents and have not acted on President Biden's positive statements. The U.S. has misperceived and miscalculated China's strategic intentions."
This is a Xi-style straightforward expression: China is not happy. In the meantime, Xi left some room for Biden because he blamed the Trump administration and Biden’s subordinates.
One clear understanding in China is that Biden needs China in order to make the economic sanctions on Russia to work. China wants to get most out of any such agreement. The public believes that, strategically, China should not give in on Russia. China + Russia can defend against U.S. missile armament. Ultimately, the basic view in China is that we can handle a cold war if we have to, even if it would not be preferable economically.
3.Are there any ways to capture how Chinese citizens are thinking about positioning in the geopolitical moment (with respect to Russia, with respect to the war on Ukraine, with respect to the United States)?
At the end of the meeting, the two presidents tasked their teams to follow up on the leaders’ discussion. The challenge for Biden is who can take over this challenging task when China beat Biden's diplomatic team with an "unprecedented candid" gesture. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is seen by the Chinese as being responsible for confrontation. He has repeatedly criticized China on a number of issues like military provocations against Taiwan, human rights abuses against ethnic minorities, and efforts to squelch pro-democracy advocates in Hong Kong. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan is described as "insidious" because of his remark that the administration determined China knew that Putin “was planning something” before the invasion of Ukraine, but the Chinese government "may not have understood the full extent” of what Putin had in mind. To make things worse, Sullivan said this when China's top diplomat Yang Jiechi was on his way to Rome for negotiations. Some believe it was a little trick for Sullivan to get advantage over Yang in the meeting.
Across the globe, there are people who support Ukraine because they dislike Russia; there are people who support Russia because they dislike the U.S. and the West. Within  China, the view is that China is suppressed by the United States, so many Chinese support Russia. On one hand the Chinese admire that Russia has taken on the U.S. (President Xi admires Putin, in that sense), but the Chinese also say, “tactics not bravery make a great general.” So far, they haven't seen Putin's strategy, so there is disappointment here. Chinese people believe if it were China in the same situation, China's generals would've planned it much better. Hence, if China felt compelled to take over Taiwan the People's Liberation Army would have had a much better plan.
4.Any final comments or thoughts based on the sentiments in China today?
On social media, there are mixed feelings among Chinese people on the war on Ukraine, like a Chinese netizen posted in a tweet:
“My emotions are with the people of Ukraine; My principle is I respect countries’ sovereignty; My stance is I oppose NATO’s expansion; I feel Russia’s frustrations; and Fundamentally I hate US-led Western hegemony."
U.S. diplomacy now relies on threats and coercion, even ordinary people in China can't accept it, let alone leaders. Biden did not offer any benefit to Xi during conversation. The most popular novel in China is “Romance of the Three Kingdoms”, facing the pressure of the strongest kingdom, two weaker kingdoms must support each other in order to survive.
Wu Xinbo, director of the Center for American Studies at Fudan University, pointed out that the biggest problem between China and the U.S. is the credit deficit of America. Shi Yinhong, director of the Center on American Studies at Renmin University, believes that the containment policy of the United States has forced China to take corresponding measures to defend its national interests, thus promoting China-Russian relations. The two scholars have been considered pro-America in the past.
