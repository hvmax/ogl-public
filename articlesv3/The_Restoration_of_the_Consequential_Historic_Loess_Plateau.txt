### The Restoration of the Consequential & Historic Loess Plateau

28 June 2021|China, Economic Development
AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy and, in particular, life in China. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. We have sought to advance a conversation about theU.S.-China relationship, and a deep understanding of local economic development in China. We have written a series about the strategic strengthentrepreneurship in China todayas well as a series aboutChina’s Belt and Road Initiative,China’s big tech economy, and the Chinese companies that are changing China and the world.We have also written a series about innovative local governance and economic development in China’s provinces and cities (for examplehere,here, andhere). This post seeks to extend the conversation around economic development in China today, with an emphasis on China’s approach to infrastructure development. – The Editorial Team

This is a story about economic development – one that has deep historical and cultural roots, and one that is benefitting from and driven by the new era of local economic development in China. We have written about this issue previously when we have examined China’slocal governments as industrial firms. And we have written about it when we have examined several of China’s local municipal strategies (e.g.,here). This case moves beyond provinces and municipalities to the Loess Plateau region. And it is one that incorporates economic development with issues of environment, sustainability, and governance (ESG) issues that are important in China and globally. In this particular case, the OGL team dives into a deep analysis of a culturally and historically significant region that is both critical economically but also in dire need of sustainable ecological development.
Dating back to the Yangshao culture (仰韶文化), the Loess Plateau  (黄土高原) has nourished Chinese people of the region for 7,000 years. In modern times, with the increase in population and soil erosion, the ecosystem is facing unprecedented pressure. It has become an urgent task to protect the Loess, the birthplace of Chinese civilization, and allow people to continue their lives there. This is both a sustainability and a cultural issue today in China.
The Loess Plateau represents the most fragile ecology in China. The basic properties of Loess - steep and dense valley terrain and the concentrated rainstorms - are the natural factors causing serious soil erosion. In addition, land reclamation and over utilization are the human factors aggravating erosion. On the Loess Plateau, the most severe erosion is happening in the border area of Shanxi, Shaanxi, and Inner Mongolia.
Geologists surmise that the Loess Plateau originated from a kind of aeolian landform (in other words, a landmass formed by the wind). Geological records suggest that about 2.6 million years ago a monsoon formed after the uplift of the Qinghai Tibetan Plateau and continuously transported the dust from the Central Asian desert to the middle reaches of the Yellow River, depositing a 200 to 400-meter-thick loess layer. It formed today's Loess Plateau (estimated as about 640,000 km2).
Some geographers believe that the Loess Plateau was once covered with vast forests. However, geologists are cautious to say that the environment of the Loess Plateau was varied among dry steppe, desert steppe, and forest steppe, between dry climate and humid climate types. Since its birth, this land has been deeply eroded by water and sand. About 150,000 years ago, the Sanmenxia (三门峡) ancient lake basin was cut through and the modern Yellow River system was formed. The sediment in the Loess area was carried to the lower reaches by water and deposited into the vast North China Plain. In the ancient geological land and waterway formations, soil erosion was not always a bad thing.
We often say that the Yellow River nurtured the Chinese civilization, but more precisely, it is the tributaries of the Yellow River on the Loess Plateau that nurtured the Chinese civilization. In his bookThe Cradle of the East, Ping-ti Ho, a Chinese American scholar, wrote: "In the Old World, field agriculture first occurred in south-western Asia, on the hilly flanks of the ‘Fertile Crescent,’ around 7000 B.C. Sometime after 5000 B.C. more intensive agriculture took place on the irrigated fields of the great flood plains of the Tigris and Euphrates. The ancient agriculture of Egypt and the Indus River valley also depended on flood plain and primitive irrigation. Among the main characteristics of the earliest Chinese agricultural system, however, was its freedom from the influence of the great flood plain of the lower Yellow River and, as a corollary, the absence of primitive irrigation… there can be little doubt that the cradle of Chinese civilization is the southeastern part of the loess highland, and area that has little in common with the great flood plain of the lower Yellow River”.
In his view, the tributaries of the Yellow River on the Loess Plateau – the Weihe River Basin (渭河流域) in Shaanxi, the Fenhe River Basin (汾河流域) in Shanxi, and the western part of Henan gave birth to China's culture. The Neolithic culture of Yangshao (仰韶) and the early agriculture of northern China originated in this region.
Soil Erosion on the Loess Plateau: From the Zhou Dynasty to Today
From the Western Zhou Dynasty (c.1046-771 BCE) through the Han (c.202BCE-220CE) and Tang (c.618-907CE) dynasties, and after 2,000 years of intense exploitation by human activities, soil erosion had become serious on the Loess Plateau. The ecosystem was on the verge of collapse in Qing Dynasty (c.1636-1912CE). One of the examples was that the ancient Liupan Mountains (六盘山) used to be one of the best forestry green on the Loess Plateau, where Kublai Khan, the emperor of the Yuan Dynasty, enjoyed it as his summer resort. But when General Lin Ze-xu (林则徐) passed on his way to exile in Xinjiang in 1841, he noted in his journal that the sand and soil were all in purple. There was no single tree in sight, but there was some tiny grass.
During the first half of the 20th century, soil erosion on the Loess Plateau was even more shocking, which attracted the attention of many foreign scholars. In 1924, Swede H. Smith said in the Preliminary Report of Botany Investigation in Southern and Central Shanxi: "At present, most of the mountain areas are bare mountains. They (the Chinese) destroyed the forest with fire and axe... Because there are no trees, those hillside lands are not only useless, but also pose constant disasters and threats to the villages here."
During the same period, W. C. Lowdermilk, an American forestry professor who taught at the University in Nanking, led his students to investigate Shanxi and Shaanxi many times and wrote numerous papers. He pointed out that the increase in population led to the destruction of vegetation and the expansion of sloping farmland; However, when the heavy rain came, topsoil without vegetation rushed into the river, and the cultivated land also lost its productivity. He believed that the urgent task was to restore forest vegetation and stop this vicious circle.
There are many reasons for the collapse of the Loess Plateau ecosystem: deforestation, blind reclamation, war turmoil, natural disasters, and political corruption. But the most fundamental reason is the pressure from population growth. From the 6th century to the 15th century, the Loess Plateau generated a quarter of China's population; During the Ming and Qing dynasties, the ratio decreased, but the absolute number was still large, reaching 40 million in 1840. Today, the population is over 100 million. Crowding the dry loess for generations, people cultivated, grazed, cooked, and heated their brick beds. When the forests were used up, they’d burn straw and fallen leaves. When food was depleted, they’d peel bark and dig roots. If the crops of the field were not enough, more slopes were reclaimed and more turf was dug up.
Clearly the ecological protections were lost. The Loess Plateau is a loose geological architecture in texture and poor in corrosion resistance. Researchers say the loess land is mainly affected by three kinds of erosions: water, wind, and gravity. Water erosion caused by rainfall strips the topsoil and deepens the gully; dust blown by strong winds, such as sandstorms, deepens those crevices; and gravity erosion brings landslide and collapse. Among the three, the most severe and extensive one is soil loss caused by water erosion.
Over the years, the topic of conservation would be brought up because it affected the lower reaches of the Yellow River. Not until the nineties did the measures to control soil and water loss in the Loess Plateau shift from engineering such as building terraces and warping dams to ecological controls such as retiring farmland and replanting forest and grass. It is recognized that the most fundamental way to reduce the erosion is to restore the vegetation and rebuild the ecosystem.
For preparation, the Chinese researchers studied closely what the United States and others did in the past, especially how the plan and compensation worked. To list a few:
1929 Hewitt Reforestation Act where New York State increased forestry from 20% 100 years ago to 65% today;1956 Soil Bank Program (U.S.);1950-1960 Land Retirement or Acreage Division (U.S.);1985 Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), the biggest land protection program of U.S. Department of Agriculture;The European Union and the United Kingdom have had land retirement program since the 1950s; andHong Kong forests are one-third manmade since 1945.

• 1956 Soil Bank Program (U.S.);
• 1950-1960 Land Retirement or Acreage Division (U.S.);

• The European Union and the United Kingdom have had land retirement program since the 1950s; and
• Hong Kong forests are one-third manmade since 1945.
There was also abundant research on the suitable vegetation and sand blocking technologies with international collaborations.
As the result of the erosion, 90% of the sediment of the Yellow River comes from the middle reaches of the Loess Plateau. It was first recorded in the Ming Dynasty (c.1368-1644 CE) that the sediment concentration of the Yellow River water was six-tenths, and it became eight-tenths in the summer, autumn and rainy seasons. In modern times, the sediment discharge into the Yellow River has been continuously observed.
Because the accelerated erosion is generally caused by human activities, the ecological reconstruction of the Loess Plateau must begin with human behavior. Those areas that are not suitable for living should be appropriately resettled so that the natural environment can be restored. At the same time, vegetation can be increased through solid central and local planning. Experts have many ideas for the renewed sustainability of this region – shrubs on shady slopes and grasses on sunny slopes, forests in the valley, and food crops only on slope terraces of less than 15 degrees, etc.
Sustainability, Reform, and Restoration
Realistically, it is social and economic development that pushed these ecological projects along. After China's opening up in 1979, the ecology of the Loess Plateau began to improve. Many attribute the change to people's living standards improving as the problems of food, fuel, and grazing had been solved, and their lifestyles changed accordingly. If anyone still worried about food and clothing, and some furtively dug up the grass roots to satiate hunger, ecology would be empty talk and a distant dream.
With more than 500 million Chinese citizens lifted out of poverty over the last 40 years, the focus on sustainability in China has elevated conversation into real policy. Since 2000, the Grain for Green Project implemented by the Chinese government has become the world's largest ecological management project and returned farmland to forest and grass. By 2017, a total of 450 billion yuan (about 65 billion U.S. dollars) had been invested, and about 300,000 km2 of land had been converted to forest and grassland. Since the implementation of the policy in 1999, the vegetation coverage of the Loess Plateau has increased significantly, from 31.6% in 1999 to about 65% in 2017. Over the last decade, the sediment at the Lijin (利津) hydrological station has been reduced from 670 million tons annually to 126 million tons per year.
The sharp decrease of discharges in the Yellow River could be related to climate change, water conservancy projects, and other comprehensive elements, but the human efforts in ecological reconstruction have contributed a great deal. People living on the Loess Plateau have built terraces, repaired ditches and dams, planted trees, returned farmland to forest and grassland, etc. All of these activities have played an important role in soil and water conservation in different regions. Comparing the water level at the same hydrological points, though there may not be enough data to confirm, we see some significant changes and a trend in a positive direction.
Today, it is crucial to stop man-made ecological destruction and end disorderly reclamation. Wisely, they should take the means of combining engineering and ecological methodologies to adapt to local conditions; neither can be neglected. And with all of this activity, the ecology of the Loess Plateau may be restored. And it can be a great lesson for generations to come.
The bottom line is that the ecological reconstruction in this region has achieved some initial and remarkable results. It is very likely a turning point in the environmental history of the Loess Plateau. Returning the green to the Loess Plateau and reconstructing the Loess ecology is a great reward for China. Without the Loess Plateau, Chinese people would have no home for their nostalgia.
