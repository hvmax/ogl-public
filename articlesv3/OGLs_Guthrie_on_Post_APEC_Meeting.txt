AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy and, in particular, life in China. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. In this post, we follow our pre-meeting analysis (here) with a post-meeting analysis delivered through an interview with Kun Liu of CGTNâ€™s World Today.
