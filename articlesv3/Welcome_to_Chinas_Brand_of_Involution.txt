### Welcome to China's Brand of Involution

2 October 2021|China, China Population
AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy and, in particular, life in China. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. We have sought to advance a conversation about the U.S.-China relationship, and a deep understanding of local economic development in China. We have written about the U.S.-China Trade War as it relates toChinese Innovation,entrepreneurship in China today,anda series aboutChina’s Belt and Road Initiative. In this post, we turn our attention to the pressures that Chinese students and workers are facing in today’s economy. – The Editorial Team
Involution (内卷or NeiJuan) is a buzzword in China these days and understanding what it means provides a unique perspective on modern China in the 2020s.
Involution as a social concept was adopted by sociologist Clifford Geertz in his 1963 bookAgricultural Involution, which examined the process of ecological change in Indonesia. In China, the term has been adopted to describe the fierce internal competition and pressure college students are experiencing today. Reflecting the emotion of exhaustion and boredom of some Chinese people especially young people, Involution is a simile of the phenomenon that peers are competing for limited resources and lead to a decline in the individual’s “benefit-to-effort ratio”
A typical involution scene is: in a company that works 40 hours a week, someone voluntarily stays to work overtime, creating the illusion “I work the hardest!” and gets the appreciation from the management. For fear of being considered “not working hard enough,” other employees also “voluntarily” stay late. Over time, “996” (1) becomes norm of the company. However, when judging from the results, nothing has changed.
Over the last year, involution has become common jargon among Chinese netizens and is used to describe many aspects of society and life in China. The competition between peers is involution, attending after-school tutoring is involution, takeaway riders are driven by algorithms to ride faster and faster is involution, and the fact that the morning rush hour of the subway is getting earlier and earlier is involution. In the most general terms, the pressure and confusion of the Chinese people experience today is involution.
Putting aside why the Tsinghua University undergraduate turned on his computer when riding a bicycle, his unintentional behavior has caused repercussions as it spread through social media. Many people who think they don’t work that hard and are not that smart, become unbearably anxious as they compare themselves to that student. People’s lives under involution are like an unstoppable merry-go-round—though running at a high speed, it still remain in the same place.
The concept of involution can’t be separated from two words: peer competition. It is not your boss who makes you work overtime, but your colleagues who are willing to work overtime. Competition drives office workers (2) to beat themselves up constantly and fall into the "making out" game (3), even though they’re exhausted, both physically and mentally. Under the reward and punishment mechanism of the ridesharing platform, takeaway drivers ride faster and faster, only to be detected by the algorithm that leads to a higher and higher quota. The ever-expanding number of enrollments has caused the devaluation of ordinary university diplomas. College students compete fiercely to achieve a high GPA and academic honors in order to obtain a more favorable position in the job market. But this adds more involution with their office workers.
Chinese anthropologist Xiang Biao described Involution as an "infinite loop like a spinning top", "a competition that does not allow failure and withdrawal." Involution is everyone competing for the same goal, in the same way and in a single evaluation system (4). If an individual gives up involution and adopts a "lying flat (躺平)" attitude, s/he will be burdened with huge moral and social pressure.
Involution is not only happening in China. South Korea, which belongs to the same Confucian cultural circle as countries like China, Japan, and Singapore, has the lowest fertility rate in the world, only 0.09% in 2020. The 2021 TV series “High Class” (하이클래스) vividly demonstrates the involution of Korea’s education which begins with elementary school admissions. Before enrolling in a prestigious elementary school, kids have to attend interviews and so do their parents. There is no exception, even for the 0.1% of high-class elites. After all, “a place that costs you one hundred million won a year” is not somewhere that you can just enter if you want.
The Americans cannot escape from involution either. The overall acceptance rate of Ivy League universities has dropped from an average of 18.69% in 2007 to 8.11% in 2021. (5) In order to get their children into elite universities, many parents have replaced traditional education concepts that encourage a child’s independence and freedom with high participation, high investment, and high control over their children's lives and education, so-called helicopter parenting or lawnmower parenting. Many high school students in America have to take various AP courses, become volunteers in addition to their normal study and strive to form a core competitive advantage for college applications.
On Chinese social media, involution is used to describe Australia's cancelation of French submarine orders after participating in AUKUS and switching to the U.S. It is one thing not to bring the French when forming AUKUS, it is another thing to cancel the $60 billion mega-project. Instead of pleasing the U.S. with bloody French steak, the Australians should place another order if they had sufficient resources.
It makes sense that many people feel success can be achieved as long as they work hard. More than 40 years of market development has raised China's economy and people's incomes, and the Internet has magnified the halo of success stories like Jack Ma. But the reality is that although China is already the fastest growing economy in the world, its economic growth rate has dropped from 9.4% (1979-2018 average) to 6.1% in 2019. If opportunities look like a dense starry sky, the distance between success and ordinary people is actually as far away as those stars.
The root cause of involution lies in the scarcity of resources and social wealth, that is, the contradiction between the finiteness of resources and the infiniteness of human desires. The fundamental feature of involution is stagnant development. As large as a country, as small as a company, the cessation of development will inevitably lead to involution.
To get out of involution, China must continue to grow its economy and make the "cake bigger.” It has become an inevitable choice for China to improve the quality of its economy by innovation and penetrating high-end industries dominated by developed countries. Only in this way can China provide more high-paying job opportunities. But the development of high-tech industries is a long journey that requires patience and continued efforts. It is not something that will happen overnight. The economic model of China determines that in most situations, the government cannot directly decide the income of corporate employees. If salaries cannot be easily raised, why not increase the disposable income of a family by shrinking its expenses? It is logic to restrict industries such as real estate, education, and medical services through administrative measures. This is a societal dilemma, however. Entrepreneurs and investors are confused, and it remains to be seen whether ordinary people are satisfied or not.
For individuals who are not willing to "lie flat," the first step to get rid of involution is to break the demon and think clearly about “what kind of person I want to be”. Once the goal is clear, instead of complaining about involution, it is better to consider which direction suits you most and what is worthy of your efforts. Most people in China didn't have a chance of involution before opening up because of poverty and stagnation. Compared with 40 years ago,  Chinese society today is considered more involutive but it also is more open, more diversified, and can provide more opportunities. To seek a better life, ordinary people should learn to embrace their lives by getting along with themselves, finding a suitable goal, and giving up the involution mentality.
1. "996" refers to ‘996’ work culture: working 12 hours a day (9 am to 9 pm) and six days a week.
2. The meaning of “Office worker” (打工人): a white-collar is still a worker, no different than a blue-collar worker.
3. The "making out" game: The British sociologist Michael Burawoy described piece-rate pay system as the "make out" game in his bookManufacturing Consent: Changes in the Labor Process Under Monopoly Capitalism. In the factory workshop, the piece-rate system created the illusion of labor as a game, workers competed with each other to "make out" and surpass their co-workers in production quotas.
