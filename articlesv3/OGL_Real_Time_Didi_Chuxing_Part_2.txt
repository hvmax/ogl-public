We hope these breaking news insights from our OGL team members will help illuminate the events of the day and provide the depth needed to understand global political, economic and cultural transitions and transformations. This post follows up onDidi Chuxing Part 1, which looked at China's  efforts to clip the wings of Didi Chuxing, the ride-hailing app. Here's OGL's Chris Gao and Dashiell Chien's reaction to our Doug Guthrie's column.

1. Why was Didi Chuxing (NYSE: DIdI) so rushed to go IPO?
On June 10, China's first law on data security, the "Data Security Law of the People's Republic of China," was promulgated, and it will take effect September 1, 2021. The law is meant to protect national data security and to "set rules” and “draw red lines" for Internet companies like Didi. On the same day in the United States, Didi officially submitted Form F-1 to the Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC). Didi’s rushed IPO at this special moment -- the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China (CPC) -- suggests the company may be looking to evade the supervision of the new law. Didi probably thought that after the IPO, what had been done couldn't be undone, and it would be more difficult for the government to supervise a global conglomerate. Beijing described DiDi's action as double-faced behavior (阳奉阴为), which meant it was asked not to move this quickly. We won’t be surprised if some of the responsible officials in communication with DiDi will be sacked for the failure to detect Didi's covert intentions.
2. Why is Didi's road to IPO so smooth?
It took only 20 calendar days and two changes from Didi’s application to the SEC on June 10 to its IPO on the New York Stock Exchange on June 30. The review time is shorter than the SEC's normal procedures and timelines, but Didi did it. In Beijing’s view, Didi must have something to hide to rush this forward. So, who is helping Didi? What is DiDi giving away in return? Chinese officials must have these questions answered. When the U.S. government regards China as its biggest competitor, many wonder why the SEC would give Didi the green light express and, apparently, its support?
3. What kind of company is Didi?
Didi is reported to have at least 80% of the market share of online ride-hailing in China. It has a VIE structure. Its largest shareholders are SoftBank and Uber. Essentially, Didi is a Chinese company as illustrated by its location and customer base. Didi may be viewed as a technology company; strictly speaking, it is a platform company rather than a hard-core tech driver. Owning a huge amount of key data, Didi is widely considered a company without core technologies of its own. Didi has secured its monopoly position by burning investors' money and the acquiescence of the Chinese regulatory authorities. Meanwhile, the Chinese regulator's antitrust investigation into the merger of Didi and Uber (2016) has not yet concluded. In addition, Chinese social media has spread that Didi has a former U.S. intelligence officer serving as its independent director. This alone inflames the Chinese conspiracy theorists: Didi has been "kidnapped" by the U.S. for its IPO on NYSE.
In view of their experiences and networks, to say the Didi funders have no political capital obviously underestimates the complexity of the issue. We are more inclined to believe that Didi's funders had been under certain pressures, which forced them to take the risk of crossing the regulatory red line, and hoping everybody was too busy focusing on the CPC's July 1 100th celebration, which was even more politically sensitive.
4. What’s the future look like for Didi?
Didi’s performance in the U.S. stock market has given the Chinese government a lot of confidence. Wall Street and investors have proved optimistic about China’s huge consumer market with their investments, despite the huge regulatory risks and uncertainties. If Didi can cooperate with the Chinese government, the company's survival in China will not be a problem. If Didi’s management fails to fully cooperate to the level the government expects, or even uses external forces to interfere with the handling of the regulatory case, anything could happen to Didi and its top management.
The Chinese government has recently taken noticeable measures to strengthen supervision against a number of leading Internet companies, such as Alibaba, Tencent, JD, and Didi. Consequently, Tencent's acquisition of Sogou, China's No.2 search engine after Baidu, was unconditionally approved on July 12, 2021. The Chinese authorities understood that the competitiveness of the Chinese Internet companies has contributed to the rise of the country's overall strength in the competition with the U.S. However, the "too big to fail" mentality for companies will not work with Chinese authorities. And if you dare to challenge the regulatory system, you will be hammered into submission. The unanimous public support on the decisions made by Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) on Didi has undoubtedly given Chinese authorities more confidence.
On July 13, Didi shares soared 11.29% and closed at the highest price of $12.42. The game of politics, the market, and investors continues.
