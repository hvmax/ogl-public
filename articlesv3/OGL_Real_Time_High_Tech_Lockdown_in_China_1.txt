On Global Leadership's feature, OGL Real Time, presents our up-to-the-minute insights on current news and events. We hope these breaking news insights from our OGL team members will help illuminate the events of the day and provide the depth needed to understand global political, economic and cultural transitions and transformations. This post follows up on the difficult decisions that the Chinese Government has made around issues relating to the regulation of China’s Big Tech Industry, especially surrounding education, and we have discussed these issues in previous posts (e.g.,here,here, andhere). In this OGL Real Time post, we also address the tensions surrounding Mainland-Taiwan relations.

Question No. 1: While we have already written about the regulation of China’s tech sector over the last year, the regulatory process continues to rapidly evolve. Please give us the OGL Realtime update on how Chinese citizens are thinking about these regulations and the aggressive moves against China’s wealthy entrepreneurs.
–Answer by Chris Gao of OGL
Given the recent heavy regulatory measures that came down from the Chinese government, most Chinese netizens do not simply consider these measures as targeting the tech companies or suppression of wealthy entrepreneurs. Chinese citizens’ reactions vary greatly depending on the industries involved and the impact on their everyday lives. Based on our on-the-ground research, ordinary Chinese citizens are thinking:
1. The “Double Reductions” (1) related the series of measures on ed-tech companies have been shocking to the investor community and, indeed, controversial. Investors from the West tend to find it shocking that a government would move in aggressive ways that ultimately wipe out significant shareholder value. Chinese citizens less so.
a) Since the release of the measures in July 2021, most parents have not eased the anxiety they have regarding their children’s education, because the impact of these regulatory measures won high school and college entrance examinations is still unclear. Although there are many shortcomings in the current examination system, Chinese parents still view the system as fair and objective, and the clear goal and judgment are highly recognized by Chinese public. So, while parental concerns over students’ scores as the main selection criterion by schools, what would be a better evaluation method? The system is viewed as the best mechanism for avoiding nepotism and corruption with respect to access to higher education.
b) As an immediate result, we see more students participating in various interests and activities, such as art, music and sports, and other creative and extracurricular activities.
c) There are additional follow-up measures by local governments. For example, the Zhejiang Hangzhou Municipal Education Bureau stipulates that college students must first have a teacher’s qualification certificate to become a private tutor, further setting a high bar for participation in after-school learning and tutoring.
d) The interests of teachers and schools have been neglected in these changes. Many teachers have extended their working hours and have undertaken more work outside of teaching, such as after-school care for students. Schools are caught in a conflict between reducing the burden of homework and improving the quality of learning. And we can’t forget the ultimate evaluation by Chinese society over a school is its performance in the high school and college entrance examination.
e) To conclude, the ordinary people don’t care about the stock prices of educational companies. They worry about the kids’ education and future opportunities.
2. After the abrupt cancellation of ANT Group's IPO in 2020, new regulatory measures on tech-companies seldom become a hot topic in China’s social media ecosystem.
In ThePaper, a well-known news media outlet in China, we checked the number of comments on the news regarding Meituan (2) on ThePaper's Weibo (3) account. While there were only 48 comments on the news that Meituan was fined for ￥3.4 billion ($500 million) for its monopolistic behavior, there were 408 comments on the report that revealed Meituan follows its users’ location 24/7. The implication here is that Chinese are more concerned with companies following them than they are with the government’s regulation of monopolistic behavior.
3. In the social media following financial sites, there are supporters and opponents towards those regulatory measures. The supporters were unhappy about the “disorderly expansion” and monopoly of the tech giants. The Opponents pointed out that the policy is not transparent and an industry could be destroyed by an ordinance from the government.
4. As to the most recent case of the China's largest real estate company Evergrande’s debt breach in September, causing the world’s concern over a potential chain reaction of debt crisis, below are the focus of Chinese netizens in a month:
Whether Evergrande's real estate development work could be continued and completed (for who has invested in a unit) regardless.The news that some Evergrande executives redeemed their bonds in advance.Why is Secretary Blinken also paying attention to Evergrande?Has Evergrande been misled by its chief economist who is reportedly paid ￥15 million ($2.3 mil) annually? (He is known for his economic commentaries)
• Whether Evergrande's real estate development work could be continued and completed (for who has invested in a unit) regardless.
• The news that some Evergrande executives redeemed their bonds in advance.
• Why is Secretary Blinken also paying attention to Evergrande?
• Has Evergrande been misled by its chief economist who is reportedly paid ￥15 million ($2.3 mil) annually? (He is known for his economic commentaries)
Generally speaking, so far Chinese netizens are not worried because they believe that the Chinese government will not allow Evergrande’s debt issue to become a systemic financial crisis.
1. Double Reduction (双减) means to reduce the excessive homework load and after-school tutoring hours on the school subjects for students in compulsory education.
2. Meituan (美团) is China’s leading e-commerce platform for food, transportation, travel, shopping and entertainment.
3. Weibo refers to Sina Weibo (Nasdaq: WB). It is a Chinese blogging site lunched in 2009, one of the biggest social media platforms in China.
Question No. 2: I know this is a difficult question, but it is so prevalent in the global media today that we need to address it. Please help us understand how Mainland China thinks about its relationship with Taiwan, both in terms of the history and the economics.

Let’s lay down some historical facts first to better explain the relationship.
1292, Kublai Khan, the emperor of the Yuan Dynasty, sent officials to Taiwan to “proclaim mercy.”1335, Yuan Dynasty officially set up a “Patrol Department” in Penghu to administer the civil affairs of Penghu and Taiwan, under the jurisdiction of Tong’an County, Quanzhou, Fujian Province (now Xiamen). Since then, China has set up special administrations in Taiwan.1402-1424 (Yongle reign of the Ming Dynasty), navigator Zheng He led a huge fleet to visit Nanyang countries. He stopped in Taiwan and brought handicrafts and agricultural products to the local residents. After the 15th century, Japanese pirates continued to harass China's southeast coastal areas. The Ming government added “guerrillas” and “spring and autumn flood guards” in Penghu; at the same time, troops were stationed in Keelung and Danshui ports.In the early 17th century, the Dutch colonists invaded Taiwan in the late Ming Dynasty. Soon, the Spanish also came to occupy some areas in the north and east of Taiwan. Later, they were driven away by the Dutch in l642, and Taiwan became a Dutch colony.Ming Dynasty 1620 on, mainland residents migrated to Taiwan on a large scale, and organized armed forces to resist the Japanese pirates and Dutch invaders.In February 1662, General Zheng Chenggong forced Dutch colony governor Coyett to sign and surrender.1683, Zheng Keshuang, the grandson of Zheng Chenggong, led the people to submit to the Qing government. In 1684, the Qing government set up patrols of the Taiwan government under Fujian Province. By 1811, Taiwan’s population had reached 1.9 million, most of which were immigrants from Fujian and Guangdong.In January 1874, the Japanese invaded Taiwan. In October, China and Japan signed the Beijing Articles, which shows that China exercises sovereignty over the whole of Taiwan. After that, Qing officials proposed the establishment of a province on Taiwan.In 1884-1885, the French attacked Taiwan and were forced to withdraw.In 1885, Taiwan became the 20th Province in China, and the first governor of Taiwan Province was Liu Mingchuan.On April 17, 1895, after China lost the Sino-Japanese War, the Qing government was forced to sign the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which humiliated the country and ceded Taiwan to Japan.On August 15, 1945, Japan announced its unconditional surrender to the allies. Taiwan and Penghu returned to China's sovereign jurisdiction.1949, after the loss of the Civil War to the Communists, the Kuomintang ROC went to Taiwan, which made Taiwan split again from its motherland.

If people have doubts on whether Taiwan belongs to China territorially, they need to review the 1943 Cairo Declaration and the 1971 UN General Assembly Resolution 2758.
What do mainland Chinese citizens think? (Not the Chinese government. This is often omitted by international media and reporters.)
Majority of people unquestioningly consider Taiwan is a part of China.The territorial integrity is a core tenet of the sovereignty, not just CPC’s point of view, but from way back thousands of years of the Chinese heritage. It is the will of the state, whether it is able to claim or not.Reunification is a question of when. People understand there is a discrepancy in ideology between the strait, and a takeover by force may be inevitable, but they wish it doesn’t have to be.The flyover is a demonstration of what the PLA is able to cover. The PLA’s position here is to reset the strait’s dynamics instead of always being in reaction mode when the Taiwan card is played.

What do Taiwan people think?
According to news, there are 70% people now claim they are Taiwanese (before was dual status of Taiwanese and Chinese). So, the Taiwan identity is very strong and set against resisting annexation.Through desensitization in history teaching by both the Kuomindang (KMT) and the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), young people in Taiwan have a diminishing historical perspective on their heritage of Chinese culture. They know less and less of what happened in the past. There were the Japanese…there were the Dutch… now there is China.The Mainland will “invade” them and Taiwanese citizens believe the U.S. will protect them. Taiwan will find ways to lean on U.S. as much as possible.

What will trigger a war over the strait?
China would prefer a peaceful solution, but we all know it is not going to happen in the foreseeable future. If there is to be a war, it will be with US. For 40 years, the PLA has  planned for a conflict that would include US involvement.Reclaiming Taiwan by force and having a war with U.S. is not a priority for Beijing. The reclamation of Taiwan would be a goal for 2035.Playing with fire around China’s bottom line: Taiwan claims independence; foreign military stationing; etc. If the bottom line is violated, China is facing a historical choice. This is the choice of ultimate national interest and historical responsibility. In the face of such historical circumstances, Beijing leaders will have no choice but go to war.The biggest risk will be if Trump returns in 2024. He and Tsai would likely egg each other on and make irresponsible moves that cause Beijing to react.All sides use the Taiwan card (or China card) to play to their populist followers for votes. So, the best is all sides consume the issue but not to cross the line, which could lead to truly catastrophic consequences.
