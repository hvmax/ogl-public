### Comparing the US & China: Creating a Safe and Equitable Society

13 October 2021|China, China politics, US-China Relations
AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy and, in particular, life in China. Our goal is to offer nuanced analyses about the global political leadership and development issues that our world is facing today. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. We have sought to advance a conversation about the U.S.-China relationship, and a deep understanding of local economic development in China. We have been writing about the U.S.-China Trade War as it relates toChinese Innovation;entrepreneurship in China today;anda series aboutChina’s Belt and Road Initiative. We have also written a good deal about comparisons between the United States and China in terms of economic and political models. This post adds to that conversation. – The Editorial Team
One of the best places to find insights and inspiration about what people are thinking and worried about with respect to China is through clients and students. Recently, in an executive classroom, I asked my students what was on their minds. This was a more junior executive class, but the question seemed like it might be a topic that is on many people’s minds. One student had become very engaged in China issues and quite vocal in raising questions about where the region is headed. As I asked my question – the starting question for many executive classes we run – this student responded (paraphrased):
I have lived in China my whole life, so this is the only world I know. I am just wondering about democracy, freedom and economic development. I know you have taught us that China’s style of state capitalism has had some advantages for economic development. But it seems like things are very tense with China right now. I am wondering which system do you think is safer for its citizens? In China, people are tracked by the Government and need to be very careful right now. Every move Chinese people make is tracked on their phones. We don’t have freedom to determine even whether our children can have tutors or play video games. And with President Xi Jinping’s Common Prosperity campaign, it seems that young business people like me are not even going to be able to take advantage of capitalism.
I was struck by the student’s response, particularly his use of the word safety (安全). The student seemed to be asking about the Chinese Government’s surveillance and drawing a line between safety and freedom on the one hand and governmental social control and personal risk (at the hands of the government) on the other.
First, let’s talk about safety. What do we really mean by this? I understood that the student was talking about democracy, freedom, self-determination, and the risks posed by a government that regularly uses surveillance. So that is one set of "security" issues, and they are certainly issues to be taken seriously.
But let’s look other examples that relate directly to safety. In these examples, I will draw comparisons between China and the country that many believe epitomizes freedom and is the pinnacle of the system of capitalist democracy in the world, the United States.
Let's look at safety through the lens of gun violence, a frequent measurement in the U.S. The United States leads the world in both firearms per capita and in total number of firearms in civilian possession. Indeed, according to the Small Arms Survey, which was produced in Geneva, Switzerland in 2017, there are more civilian-owned guns in the United States than there are citizens. Let that sink in a bit. In the United States, the pinnacle of freedom and democracy, there are about 120 guns per 100 people (the ONLY country for which there are more civilian-owned guns than people). The number for China: 3.6 guns per 100 people.
The question is not just how many civilian-owned firearms are there; it is also how they are used to inflict violence. According to the University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, the United States has a gun-related death rate about 180 times that of China (3.6 vs .02 per 100,000 population). When it comes to this metric, the United States is clearly not safer than China.
What about with COVID-19? The United States leads the world in COVID-19 deaths – another ignominious category. As of October 10, 2021, there were 734,611 COVID-19-related deaths. Only Brazil and India came proved to be as  ineffectual in controlling the U.S. pandemic (and even they lag behind the United States by hundreds of thousands).
And in the world’s pinnacle of capitalism, freedom, and democracy, we are still arguing about mandates for masks and vaccines.
We have written about China’s handling of the pandemic periodically; for example,here,here, andhere. In the same timeframe as the numbers listed above, China has had a total of 4,636 deaths. China skeptics will immediately shout that China is lying – underreporting and manipulation of data have a long history in Communist China and, some would argue, are endemic to the system. But do we really think Chinese officials are underreporting by a factor of 180, which is what it would take to get to U.S.-type numbers? Further, anyone who is living in China – and the OGL China team resides there – will tell you that contact tracing, aggressive lockdowns, and mask wearing have saved lives. Yes, they are inconveniences and perhaps incursions on individual freedoms, but these measures have saved lives, hundreds of thousands of lives.
And this is where things get interesting. Going back to the student’s question, he seemed to be asking about social monitoring (tracking phones) and a lack of freedom in a variety of areas. But it is through these measures that the government has saved lives, particularly during the pandemic. Contact tracing has saved lives.
And just one final point on the lack of surveillance in U.S. society: There is a tremendous amount of surveillance in the United States, too. It is just that we accept that large technology companies are going to do it – in the name of capitalism and share prices, and the hallowed Dow Jones Industrial Average. As long as the government is not doing it, Mark Zuckerberg, Sheryl Sandberg, and other major shareholders will cheer you on all the way to the bank.
Which brings us to the equitable issue and the student's question about enabling or handicapping entrepreneurs. Recently, President Xi has been moving aggressively against China’s tech sector, against the private education tutoring sector, and against the elite economic class in general. He has also moved against sectors like gaming and representations of Western cultural trends, e.g., Chinese actors and actresses, LGBTQ representations in popular media, etc. As a young manager, the student wondered if he was ever going to get his shot at the market economy?
Patience here. How do you build an equitable economy and society? Here again, I would draw some comparisons. While we have heard and read a great deal about the rapid rise in inequality in China over the course of the economic reforms – and certainly President Xi’s recent rhetoric seems to confirm this concern. Today, China and the United States are not that different in terms of inequality. While skeptics will quickly cite the statistic that the per capita income in the U.S. is six times that of China’s, per capita income statistics are very superficial. Why? Because they are based on averages over the entire population – so the wealthiest 1% are lumped in with the poor and unemployed, and we come up with an average per person across the population. This tells us nothing about inequality across the economy. Instead, let’s look at the distribution of wealth:
Ratios indicate ratios of the average income of the richest 10 and 20% compared to the bottom 10 and 20% of society. Gini Coefficients are calculated as 0 means a completely equal society and values near 1 indicate a society in which the vast majority of the population has very little income or wealth, while a very small proportion of the population controls all of the income and/or wealth; thus, the higher the coefficient, the more unequal the society. Two calculations are given here (World Bank and CIA); the Wealth Gini was calculated by Credit Suisse.

Actually, the U.S. and China are pretty close in terms of income inequality. By the 10% and 20% ratios, China is a little more unequal than the United States. In terms of Gini Coefficients, the World Bank and the CIA rate the United States as a little more unequal than China. However, if we look at wealth, the United States is significantly more unequal than China in terms of the Wealth Gini. This should not be a huge surprise, given that many wealthy people and families have their wealth tied up in property, equities, and other investments. The Wealth Gini is probably a more accurate measure of how unequal a society is.
One final point on this issue. Since the 1980s and the Milton Friedman revolution, the United States, through corporate tax breaks and the errant “theory” of trickle-down economics, has seen the largest transfer of wealth from the working and middle class to the country’s wealthiest class than in any period in the last 100 years of U.S. history. Radical markets have not created more opportunity for the poor and working class; they have created greater opportunity for the wealthy to collect money in the stock market and for corporate elites to earn windfalls through share buyback programs.
Which system or society is safer and more equitable, the U.S. or China? At this point, I am really not sure. I guess it depends on what metrics you look at. But I am not sure that the United States today provides the sole good example for the world in these areas going forward.
