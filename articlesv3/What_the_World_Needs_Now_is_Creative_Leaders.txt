### What the World Needs Now is Creative Leaders

9 August 2023|Creative Leadership, Everyday Leadership, Leadership, Leadership Development
We're bringing this post back up for a viewing to honor our dear friend Craig Markus. Craig passed away earlier this week, far too early for those of us who knew him. He was an exceptional light in a world that can be remarkably dark. He loved pop culture and space and all the simple things that make you laugh. He was a brilliant creative leader and designer. He was more than a creative thinker and amazing teacher though. He was, most importantly, a great father, one who cherished his two sons and cheered on their every victory, and a wonderful friend. He will certainly be missed.
Craig Markus, MBA, is an award-winning executive who has served in both creative and business roles in the world's most recognized and respected advertising agencies and marketing firms. During the coronavirus lockdown, Craig is expanding his leadership coaching activities and exploring how he can further share what he's learned over 30 years of providing confident, consequential, and creative leadership to international companies and organizations. Here, Craig discusses how great, even good, leadership must have creativity at its heart. -- The OGL Team
It is the summer of 2020 and I am thinking back to spring when this all started. Before most of us could really understand or feel the weight of what we were about to experience, when it seemed our biggest problems were a lack of toilet paper, disinfectants and paper towels. Oh, how I long for the good old days when we were freaking out about hand sanitizer. Like most of you, I now have plenty of toilet paper. Thanks in part to Proctor & Gamble and my girlfriend’s anxiety/love of bulk items, we have enough for COVID-19, -20, and, if we are judicious, -21. But we aren’t prepared for this other shortage. The one that is quietly but noticeably having a huge impact – a shortage of leadership.
@*#$! I think they’re out of leadership.
@*#$! I think they’re out of leadership.
It has become too easy to point to the man behind the Resolute Desk as the poster child for this shortage(not to mention decent human behavior). What we are experiencing is not just a lack of leadership in politics and government.There is a lack of effective leadership in nearly every corner of society and business.It didn’t happen overnight. It’s been brewing for years.
Unfortunately, or perhaps fortunately, leadership happens to be one of those things that you don’t notice is missing or has gone bad until you really need it. Running out of leadership, in a time of converging crises of global health, national economic, and social consciousness is much,much, more damaging. And unfortunately, that kind of leadership is much harder to find than Charmin.
We need our leaders to be at their best when we face our biggest challenges. Abraham Lincoln, Martin Luther King, Indira Gandhi. Great leaders become great because of how they handle the tough stuff. Captain Kirk left the bridge when there were no Klingons in sight, but the minute shit got real, he was the first one there and the last to leave. In 2020, here on earth, shit has gotten real.
COVID:19 isn’t the only pandemic
We are sick, and it’s not just the coronavirus: the climate, institutionalized racism and sexism, socioeconomic disorder, classism, and the way we treat each other, to name a few. There are multiple pandemics and when we look back, I hope we can see that this was the catalyst for the change that we needed, rather than just a pause. But for that to happen, for us to use this moment to truly “get better”, among other things, our leaders are going to have to change too. We need a new breed of leaders better suited to today’s world, and we need our current leaders to just be better.
WTF! Shouldn’t we have this leadership thing down by now?
YES! We love leadership! We have loved it since the first fish-human led us out of the ocean. Our first celebrities were leaders – Jesus, Moses, Shin Tzu, and Alexander the Great. We love to talk about our leaders. We love to write about them, read about them, and study them in all areas of our lives government, business, culture, the military, sports, medicine, science, media, entertainment, art, music, etc. This obsession has become big business. There are more than 600,000 recommendations on Amazon alone for everything from profiles of presidents, kings, queens, and generals to business school publications to biographies by entrepreneurs, executives, players, and coaches.
Over the past 75 years, the study of leadership has also become one of the faster growing fields in education. There are undergraduate degrees, graduate degrees, PhDs. There are executive courses, on-line course, outdoor courses. There are seminars and workshops, coaches, and consultants. There are even schools where you can start “developing tomorrow’s leaders today” as early as kindergarten. There are podcasts, YouTube videos, TED talks, experts to follow and, as I write this, I am sure people are TikToking their way through the7 Habits of Highly Successful People. The business has never been healthier. This should be the golden fucking age of leadership. So, what’s the problem?
Not the leaders we're looking for
I wanted to understand where they went. The leaders. The really good ones. I know they are out there. I know there isn’t a shortage of people who want to lead, who want to change the world, who want to make it better, and who are perfectly qualified to do so. We are seeing them slowly start to come to the forefront. I just think, to mention toilet paper one more time, they are in a different aisle.
So, I dug into articles, studies and findings. OK, fine, I Googled. I Googled “top leadership traits”, “top leadership traits business school”, and “top leadership qualities”. I read business publication articles and business school pieces. I even read Tony Robbins (don’t judge, I like TR), all in an effort to try to figure out what is holding leaders, and us, back.
All the lists looked something like this:
11 powerful Traits of successful Leaders (Forbes):
Self-managing, acting strategically, effective communicator, accountability, setting goals, having a vision, managing complexity, fostering creativity, creating lasting relationships, team-building.
The 5 Essential Qualities of a Great Leader (Inc.):
Clarity. Decisiveness. Courage. Passion. Humility.
6 Characteristics of an Effective Leader (Harvard Business School):
Ability to Influence Others. Transparency—to an Extent. Encourage Risk-Taking and Innovation. Value Ethics and Integrity. Act Decisively. Balance Hard Truths with Optimism.
10 Basic Leadership Qualities (Tony Robbins):
Integrity, Ability to delegate, Communication, Self-awareness, Gratitude, Learning agility, Influence, Empathy, Courage, Respect.
I noticed something missing: something so fundamental to humanity, and something that, to paraphrase American mythologist and author Joseph Campbell, might be the single most distinguishing characteristic of the species. It frightened me that the powers that be had left it off the list—creativity.
It is true that there are many evolutionary changes that have enabled us (hopefully not temporarily) to become the dominant species on the planet. These include, in no particular order, the opposable thumb, the ability to walk upright, reason, memory, and the capacity for language.
But creativity is the glint in the eye of humanity. It is our essence. Creativity got us out of the rain/snow/eyesight of the woolly mammoth and into a cave. Creativity allowed us to see a rock as a way to feed our families, fire as more than a deity, and the world as more than a disk. Creativity is how we pass on stories that teach values. It’s creativity that has enabled us to move fast, to fly high, and travel far. Creativity gets us over, under, and around. Creativity is how we move forward. How on earth could we have failed to prioritize the importance of creativity when it comes to leadership?
The best leaders have always been creative leaders
We may not want to call them that, but they are. Gandhi, Mandela, King, Einstein, Churchill, Lincoln, Washington, Steinem, Jobs, Wooden, Merkel, the Obamas, and the list goes on and on. In order to achieve success, each and every one of them had to be creative. It was a core attribute. Jobs invented, Churchill used language, Washington famously retreated as an offensive maneuver, John Wooden created the Pyramid of Success, Lincoln created a "Team of Rivals". Think about your favorite leaders and I am willing to bet that creativity/creative thinking/being creative was critical to their success. Even the fictional ones like Kirk were creative (how else could one face the Trouble with Tribbles).
Creativity always leads
In an effort to encourage our leaders to be more creative and for creative people to aspire to positions of leadership, and to try to get the “leadership experts” to rethink their lists, I have tried to identify what it is about creativity and creative people that makes many of them ideal leaders.
My point is simple. Creativity always leads. The best leaders are creative leaders in that they possess some or all of these qualities. And somehow, for some unknown reason(s), we have ignored creativity as a factor. The time has come to recognize creativity as critical to contemporary and future leadership. That is, if we truly hope to get better.
Creatives thrive on a challenge, especially to the status quo.The times they are a changin’ (a creative wrote that), and fast. Creatives rise to a challenge. Creative people are fond of saying things like “that’s not good enough” and “It can be better.” That’s not their egos talking, it’s their vision. It’s frustration at and with the status quo. Right now, we need leaders who are eager to change the world, and who aren’t afraid to let go of what isn’t working.
Creatives are curious AND open minded.Creatives are open to new experiences, new ideas, and new expression. Creatives intentionally seek them. They like the novel, the uncharted. Creatives are uncomfortable when they get too comfortable. No one is contented right now. We need creative leaders who are wide eyed and open minded
Creatives not only imagine, but can imagine how to get there.We need new ways to approach new problems and new ways to approach old problems. Einstein (great creative leader) famously said that, “The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again but expecting different results.” Creative people look for different answers but also know that people, by nature, resist change. And so, they figure out how to build the bridge that others will cross.
Creatives are actually problem solvers.I have worked with creatives my whole life. Most people think great creative work is like magic. It’s not. It is problem solving. Mathematicians use slide rules or whatever mathematicians use. Creatives use intellect and imagination. In order to come up with a beautiful solution, one needs to really understand the problem. Only then can one imagine a solution that no one else saw coming.
Creatives think out of the box.It’s been very fashionable to write that ‘why’ is the most important question one can asked. But creative thinkers ask one that is equally, if not more important. They ask “why not?”. President Kennedy, in his famous speech at Rice University, only asked “why” choose the moon? He was also challenging the entire space community by asking “why can’t it be done” before the decade was out. Why can’t your phone be more than a phone? Why can’t I kneel during the national anthem? Why and why not lead us out of the box? (Old advertising joke: “How many art directors does it take to change a light bulb? Does it have to be a light bulb?”)
Creatives know when to use intuition over institution.This one is a bit tougher. As I mentioned, the understanding of leadership has become heavily institutionalized. And there is tremendous value that come from knowledge and understanding. But creatives learn to listen to their intuition. They have to. Henry Ford (creative leader) once said that if he had asked people (the institution) what they wanted, they would have answered “a faster horse”.
Creatives are courageous, passionate, visionary, strategic, agile.When you cull through the lists like the ones I cited above, you realize that many of the traits come naturally to creative thinkers. Not all of them, but many. They are part of the profile.
Creatives are makers not takers.Boy, do we need this one. Creative people have to make. It’s the basic operating system. It’s like breathing. This is very different than a leader who is simply commanding and moving people in a direction. I’m not saying there is no place for that kind of leadership. We do need leaders who are going to give more than they take, either in salary or Twitter attention. People who model the kind of behavior they are trying to incite. Kennedy was particularly good at this as well, encouraging others to “ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country.”
I am not saying that every creative person has all these traits, nor am I saying that every creative person should be put in a position of leadership. Or that every leadership position should be filled by a creative person. That would be an absolute nightmare. But I am hopeful. We are already starting to see creativity in leaders at play. And I am making a case that it is going to not just need to continue but become part of everyday leadership and our leadership every day.
