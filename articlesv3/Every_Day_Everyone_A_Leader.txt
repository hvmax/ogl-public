AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. Several of us have advised companies and taught about leadership over the years, and we have developed a theory of leadership that takes us away from the big personality or charismatic leader to the person on the ground fighting for their team, community, or family. In this post, we seek to continue our advancement of a view of everyday leadership in this day and age. – The Editorial Team

In the last few decades, society has come to worship the charismatic leader – strong in crisis, magnetic in personality and passionate of vision. Yet, after years of the born-to-lead culture, today’s public space is sorely lacking individuals who are capable of mastering their organizations, leading movements and inspiring change.
That is especially true today, as we ride the disorienting waves of fear and indecision associated with the coronavirus pandemic, widespread geopolitical disaffection and racial unrest. This moment, with its complexity and fragmentation, demands a new type of leader and an improved approach to leadership.
There is no doubt that the dominant leadership theories that guided public discussion and scholarship in the mid-20th century have fostered generations of leaders in industry and government. They have a solid track record of achievement, and they should not be discarded. Effective leaders do have a vision for the organization; a passion for executing that vision; and have established an environment of transparency and integrity to ensure the organization succeeds.
The second wave of leadership scholarship in the 20th century brought us the charismatic leader. Harvard Business School Professor Abraham Zaleznik in his 1977 essay, “Managers and Leaders: Are They Different?”, dramatically changed the trajectory of leadership scholarship. By turning leadership into a personality trait, Zaleznik laid the foundation for the cult-based view of leaders. Only visionary, charismatic and inspiring individuals need apply for the ranks of leadership.
These are great albeit clichéd notions of leadership that must evolve to meet the needs of today’s individuals and organizations. Leadership isn’t the province of the magnetic personality, and it isn’t solely reserved for the individual at the top of the corporate ladder. It doesn’t depend exclusively on a passionate vision or assume that integrity alone will guarantee effectiveness.
Everyday Leaders, quite simply, are forged in the day-to-day work of organizations; that only by mastering organizational and human complexity can leaders align strategy with organizational dynamics; and that leaders must know themselves, alert to their failings and graces, in order to better serve the organization. The anchors of our framework are organized around five key themes: complexity and alignment, humility and being wrong, democracy, introspection, and creativity.
Everyday Leadership's main components.
Everyday Leadership's main components.
Complexity and alignment. Leaders must embrace complexity for the opportunities it holds, both the complexity of the organization and of the human dynamics within the organization. Only by thinking deeply about these intricate patterns and relationships can a leader align organizational form and function, and craft strategies that create new and unexpected avenues for organizational growth and innovation.
Humility and being wrong. Leaders must have an innate understanding of who they are and be able to define their strengths and weaknesses. While some debate whether acknowledging weakness and apologizing for errors undermines leaders, we contend that by admitting mistakes leaders can gain credibility and trust within the organization. Humility is a powerful tool for personal and institutional growth.
Democracy. Individuals at every level of the organization are capable of leadership. In fact the success of the organization depends on each individual being empowered to lead, because leaders are not born, they mature in the workplace and in civic life.
Introspection. Everyday leaders do not lead by intuition or charisma alone, but instead by having the patience to think analytically about how the parts of their organizations fit together as a whole. They think deeply about their role in their organizations and how best to lead – or to evolve as leaders – based on their profound understanding of themselves and their institutional cultures.
Creativity. The infinite complexity of the organization and the individuals who make up its workforce should be celebrated. Good leaders understand that complexity adds depth, and they embrace it. When leaders follow the typical mindset of strategy and economics, they gravitate toward what is common, comfortable and known. By embracing creativity, leaders can find endless opportunities to discover something new. The real world is much more exciting and interesting, and it requires creativity in its leaders to respond to the unpredictable moment.
Some may even wonder about the description of our theory: Everyday Leadership. The dictionary definition of “everyday” is simple, “an adjective that means commonplace, ordinary, or normal.” Describing our leaders as common or ordinary doesn’t diminish our view of the everyday leader. We believe it elevates the notion, ensuring equity and agency for everyday leaders in every position in an organization.
Finally, this kind of leadership is built and sustained through everyday action because it insists on the full participation of everyone. Our leadership goal isn’t the creation of effective leaders alone, it is the creation of successful organizations that are guided by far-sighted, humble and creative leaders.
This thinking about leadership might seem mundane and quotidian in comparison to flashier manifestos. What we are proposing is a simple framework – built on a deep understanding of human behavior and interpersonal relationships – that’s sole purpose is creating an effective organization. In leadership, sometimes the best choice is not counting on a single individual to save the day but rather looking for a more versatile and universal leadership that engages everyone, every day.
