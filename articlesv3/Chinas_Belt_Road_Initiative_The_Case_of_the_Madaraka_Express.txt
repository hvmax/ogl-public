### China’s Belt & Road Initiative: The Case of the Madaraka Express

24 September 2020|Belt & Road Initiative, China
AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy and, in particular, life in China. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. We believe in careful quantitative econometric analysis but also deep case study analysis. We have sought to advance a conversation about the U.S.-China relationship and a deep understanding of local economic development in China. We have written a series about the strategic strength oflocal economic development in China’s 2nd and 3rd tier citiesandentrepreneurship in China today. We have also recently embarked on a major research project on theChina’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). This post continues our conversation on the BRI. – The Editorial Team
By The On Global Leadership Team
China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI, 一带一路), the investment plan connecting Asia, Africa, and Europe through a network of railways, ports, roads, and digital infrastructure, remains a particular focus of On Global Leadership, in part, because of its historical and visionary impact. In previousposts, we discussed the logic behind the initiative, what we and others have called China’s Marshall Plan.
In this essay, we drill down deeply and explore BRI’s experience in Africa by examining the history of the construction of Kenya’s standard gauge railway (SGR), the Madaraka Express. BRI’s focus on Africa is significant. In 1980, the per capita gross domestic product (GDP) of most African countries was higher than that of Mainland China. By 2018, only three African countries’ – Seychelles, Equatorial Guinea, and Mauritius—exceeded China’s per capita GDP. One of the most important lessons from China’s economic development is to develop infrastructure first, which might be overly simplified as, “Wanna be rich? Build roads first!” (想致富, 先修路)
Madaraka Express: A Brief History
The Mombasa-Nairobi Standard Gauge Railway was designed to link Mombasa, the largest port in East Africa, and Nairobi, Kenya’s capital city. The name is particularly telling. Kenya declared independence on June 1, 1963, some four decades after becoming a British colony, and its national day is called Madaraka Day. Madaraka means “power” and “responsibility” in Swahili, Kenya’s native language.
The SGR is a flagship project under the Vision 2030 development agenda aimed to make Kenya a middle-income country by 2030. Reflecting the thinking that Africa must define its own destiny, the Madaraka Express is a Kenyan idea, although one that was only made possible by the partnership with China.

Many believe that if not for Chinese loans and Chinese companies’ strong track record of completing projects on time, Kenya probably would not have decided to build its first new railway since 1901. (The last railway was built by the British, and it was known as “The Lunatic Express.”) The Madaraka Express connects Kenya’s Northern Corridor, stretching from the port city of Mombasa and ending at the border city of Malaba. The project is being built in phases:
·Phase 1(472 km}: Mombasa – Nairobi, completed and started operation on May 31, 2017, the construction cost was US$3.8 billion.
·Phase 2{490 km}: Nairobi – Kisumu – Malaba that is divided into three sub-phases.
oPhase 2A{120 km}: Nairobi – Naivasha, completed and started operation on October 16, 2019, the construction cost was US$1.5 billion.
oPhase 2B{262 km}: Naivasha – Kisumu, which is on hold for now due to a dispute between Kenya and China on financing.
oPhase 2C{107 km}: Kisumu – Malaba, pending.
The general contractor of the SGR is China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC), a subsidiary of the China Communications Construction Company (CCCC). The SGR is operated and managed by Africa Star Railway (Afistar), a majority shareholder is CRBC. The Export-Import Bank of China undertook 90% of the SGR financing. Ultimately, although largely financed by China, the SGR is owned by the Kenyan government.
The SGR has carried the burden of high expectations vis à vis Kenya’s economic development, and it has not met its financial goals. The debt from its construction, as well as the issues in operation between China and Kenya, have sent ripples through public opinion in Kenya in recent years.

The future of the full line was thrown into some doubt after the Kenyan Appellate Court ruled in June 2020 that “the $3.2 billion contract between Kenya and China for the construction of the Standard Gauge Railways (SGR) is illegal.” Kenya has accepted more than $5 billion loans from China for SGR construction since 2013. If Kenya fails to service the loans, local leaders fear China will wrest control back over some of Kenya’s most important infrastructure, including its Inland Container Depot in Nairobi or the Mombasa port whose assets were used as collateral for the loan.
A number of African nations have become leery of the BRI, labeling it debt-trap diplomacy. Under such terms, China gives enormous loans to developing nations with loan terms that allow China to leverage the loan recipient’s indebtedness to secure other economic, military or political ends. Kenyans fear the loss of their infrastructure, following examples in Zambia, which lost an airport, and Djibouti, which opened its doors to the construction of China’s first overseas military base.
Railways have never been a business that makes easy money. The Eurostar, the Japanese Shinkansen, Amtrak in the U.S., and Chinese high-speed rail operators all have had difficulty generating profits. Only through government support and soft budget constraints can most railways cover huge operational losses and survive. The revenue of the SGR line was KSh10.1billion in its second full year of operations, while the cost of operation has been estimated at about KSh18 billion a year, a deficit of about 45%. The mega project will take a long time to break even.
The reviews for the passenger service have been mostly positive. There is no denying that the railway is a romantic way to travel. SGR was listed among the top 13 most magnificent railway tours for 2019 by the Telegraph. In less than five hours and at a speed of 120km/h, the Madaraka Express has proved to be a preferred and reliable option for travel between Nairobi and Mombasa. Although prices of the economy ticket went up from Ksh700 ($7) to 1,000 ($10), overall seat occupancy remained at more than 96%, requiring booking to be done 30 days in advance. Hotels and parks at the coast have attributed their high number of bookings to the Madaraka Express, especially for first‐time visitors.
One strategic challenge for the SGR is to scale its freight volume to reach the break-even threshold, i.e. 12 million tons a year. That means lifting the share of cargo transportation of Mombasa port from 15% to 40%. However, this will not be easy. The technology adopted by the SGR is more advanced and the speed is higher, although the source and quantity of cargoes along the SGR have not increased dramatically. Moreover, there are two existing transportation routes parallel to the Mombasa‐Nairobi SGR: the highway A109 and the meter-gauge railway (MGR) built in 1901. Thus, on the premise that the Kenyan economy remains flat, the SGR will inevitably compete fiercely with the other two routes. The measures promulgated by the Kenya government to force cargo owners to use SGR were criticized by the road transportation industry and ultimately had to be withdrawn.
Kenya’s public debt as a percentage of GDP has increased to above 62% in 2019, up from 42% when President Uhuru Kenyatta took office in 2013. Nevertheless, on the questions about debt issues, the African Export Import Bank says the concern about the Chinese lending to African nations like Kenya is overblown, and China is filling a vital gap as a development partner for capital‐scarce Africa.

In June 2019, Kenyatta, during a trip to China, had expected to finalize an agreement with Beijing to secure another $3.7 billion in new loans to build the third phase of the SGR line to Kisumu, the port city in the north of Kenya. Those talks never resulted in the new SGR loans, but he was able to secure a $400 million loan to restore the British-built meter-gauge railway to the Ugandan border.
Critics have to remember when Canadian Pacific Consultant Services (CPCS) recommended the SGR option as opposed to MGR in 2009 in the feasibility study for the East African Railways Modernization Master Plan, they had projected an economic growth of 3‐4 % by 2030, much lower than Kenya’s average 5.6% growth rate from 2015 to 2019. On the other hand, switching to domestic circulation of its economy, China likely will be more cautious as it continues to invest in BRI projects. It is foreseeable that enabling existing projects to achieve better results will be more valued than new projects.
The Case of Lafarge Holcim
Headquartered in Rapperswil-Jona, Switzerland, LafargeHolcim became the world's largest cement producer after two companies - Lafarge and Holcim - merged in 2015. As a supplier, it has participated in 42 large-scale BRI infrastructure projects in 18 countries. The former Lafarge entered the Kenyan market as early as the 1960s and is the largest local cement producer there. With an annual production capacity of 2 million tons, it has 40% market share in Kenya today.
Sensing the opportunities for business development with Chinese companies, which were exploring global infrastructure markets, LafargeHolcim created a position called Group SVP and Strategic Account Director (SAD) in Beijing in 2013 to serve the global business needs of large Chinese construction contractors like CCCC. Shortly afterwards, LafargeHolcim joined the Kenya SGR project.
The cement produced in Kenya adheres to the British standard, which is quite different from the Chinese standard that would generally be used in the SGR project. Led by the new SAD, LafargeHolcim established multi-level communications in China and Kenya with the Chinese contractor. The company's French R&D center and the technical department in China jointly proposed a technical improvement plan for their Kenya plants. An engineer was sent from China to Kenya to supervise the technical transformation. Its Mombasa plant has an annual production capacity of 900,000 tons. In 2015, it supplied 160,000 tons of cement to the SGR project. The remaining 740,000 tons could only be sold in discount to reflect its past specification. As a result, LafargeHolcim Kenya cut its profit by US$6.7 million.
Due to the tight schedule for SGR construction, the transportation capacity of the third-party logistics companies in play couldn’t meet the needs. LafargeHolcim headquarters invested more than 5 million Euros to purchase 65 sets of cement trucks and leased them to the 3PL to meet the demanding project timelines. To ensure effective communication with the SGR project team, LafargeHolcim Kenya hired a Chinese key account manager to serve the SGR project. He and the local Kenyan account manager drove 1,000 kilometers back and forth every two weeks to visit all the construction sites of the SGR.
From this dynamic, it seems clear that the service was meticulous and the outcomes were important. LafargeHolcim won 87% of the cement contract and supplied about one million tons of cement for the SGR from 2014 to 2017. The partnership between LafargeHolcim and the Chinese organizations paid off. In 2018, LafargeHolcim won a bid from CCCC to provide cement for the Malaysia Coastal Railway Project. This US$100 million contract is the largest cement supply contract ever in the global building materials industry.
The Challenge of Human Resource Management
Although CRBC has had construction projects outside of China over the last 30 years, the SGR project became a significant challenge. Because railway construction and operations integrates the technology-intensive and labor-intensive activities, human resources management was at the top of the many challenges faced by CBRC in completing the SGR.
During the construction phase, CRBC managers were most troubled by frequent strikes by local employees. In China today, strikes are considered serious labor disputes and are very rare; in Kenya, strikes are much more common. Many strikes were caused by what  Chinese business owners consider to be relatively trivial issues such as whether drinks supplied in workers’ meals ought to be water or milk. Debates around the management of Kenyan employees were spirited but also sought to put forward a template for HR management in BRI projects going forward.
For example, in 2018, China’sPetrochemical Construction Magazinepublished an article to share experiences on how to manage local Kenyan employees. Using SGR as an example, the article listed the risks and countermeasures in five key areas: recruitment and work assignments, pre-work training, logistics support, work supervision, and handling strikes. While the first four risks had two to three suggested responses, the strike-handling issue had 18 suggested measures for Chinese managers operating in Kenya. Those solutions included analyzing the possibilities of influencing and appealing to other local employees; arranging for on-site security to maintain order after a strike breaks out; encouraging employees to express their demands in writing, etc.
To ensure Kenyans take over the operations and maintenance of SGR in 2027, two major requirements in the O+M contract signed between the Kenyan government and CRBC are knowledge transfer and the localization of management positions. CRBC selected China Southwest Jiaotong University (SWJTU) to train local employees before the Mombasa‐Nairobi SGR started operation in 2017.

Considering the wide range of skills involved in training, from April 2016 to May 2017, SWJTU organized a team with more than 60 teachers from seven domestic railway vocational colleges to serve all types of railway workers in the SGR operation. Many subject lecturers did not speak English, and they were accompanied by English translators in classes. The project opened two sessions with a total of 25 classes and trained 893 local trainees, most of the trainees have received college or undergraduate education. The overall evaluations of the Chinese teachers on the Kenyan students were good; they have been trained to become the future trainers.
Competency-based education (CBE) was the main teaching method applied. Selected subjects were translated into English as handouts. The training venue was in the Kenya Railway Technical Training Institute, and the relevant practical training was conducted in the Nairobi railway depot. The requirements of trainees reflected the characteristics required for railway operations. For example, trainees who were late for their courses more than three times would be disqualified.
CRBC also sponsored 100 Kenyan high school graduates as Afistar’s management trainees to pursue university education at Beijing Jiaotong University in China in railway-related undergraduate majors. Following the monthly training exercises, the Kenyans have gained skills that enable them to operate and maintain rolling stock, locomotive, dispatch, track, communication and signaling systems, freight and passenger services.
By the end of 2019, the total number of Afistar employees was 3,201, of which 2,525 were Kenyans. The number of Kenyan supervisory/management staff reached 252, and the highest position held by a Kenyan is deputy general manager. Fifty-eight out of 123 work assignments can be independently carried out by 1,072 Kenyan staff members.
A Cross-National Experience
The Chinese have a culture of pragmatism in which the results of doing things are more important than the process. In Kenya, reflecting its British customs, the process of accomplishing one thing is at least as important as the result, if not more important. Proper process means more transparency, more communication, and more time spent.
Realizing the importance of responding to the concerns of Kenyan society, Afistar hired a Kenyan public relations manager and publishes social responsibility report every year. Recognizing the expectations and responsibilities behind the strict requirements of Chinese management, Kenyan employees are also adapting to the Chinese management style. This is a process of adapting to each other.
From China’s view, the Kenyans might better focus on how to amplify the impact of the SGR in promoting the country’s social and economic development. Every year, Kenya imports a large number of industrial products. The improvement of infrastructure makes it possible for Kenya to accelerate its industrial development and realize import substitution. As we have written previously aboutChina’s Double Circulation Systemand the development ofindustrial clustersto build manufacturing supply chains, the lessons from China are important for other developing nations. And major infrastructure projects like SGR can play a significant role in these economic development projects. SGR can promote the development of areas along the route and encourage more balanced economic development between regions. The increase in SGR freight volume will depend on how the economic pie is enlarged. Its economic benefits will be fully realized only if Kenya puts the necessary supporting infrastructure and policies in place.
In Kenya, the SGR draws a significant amount of attention and scrutiny, some positive, some critical, just like the criticism of the MGR built by the British over 100 years before. Certainly, the dept-diplomacy issue must be addressed in Africa as China continues its BRI initiatives. But without railway construction, Nairobi would be a significantly less developed city. After grabbing global attention through SGR, Kenya should seize upon the opportunity to fully exploit its dividends, allowing it to become a stage for investment competition from countries around the world, just as many Chinese provinces have done over the last four decades.
