### The Reappearance of Jack Ma and Alibaba: Return or Retreat?

10 April 2023|China, Economic Development
AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy and, in particular, life in China. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. We have written about thehistoryandcurrent stateof U.S.-China relations. In this post, we explore the return of Alibaba's founder Jack Ma, and what his resurfacing means in China today for Alibaba and other mega companies.
For China, the last week of the first quarter of 2023 was, in short, a happening week.
In Beijing, Tim Cook (CEO of Apple), Jay Y. Lee (executive chairman of Samsung Electronics), Amin Nasser (CEO of Aramco), Ola Källenius (CEO of Mercedes-Benz) and some  60+ global business leaders discussed the economic recovery in the 2023 Annual Meeting of the China Development Forum.
In Hainan, 2,000 delegates including Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, Cote d'Ivoire Prime Minister Patrick Achi, and Chinese Premier Li Qiang attended the Boao Forum for the Asia Annual Conference 2023, and its theme was an "Uncertain World: Unity and Cooperation”.
Maye Musk, mother of Tesla's founder Elon Musk, toured different cities across China and promoted her new book,A Woman Makes a Plan.Meanwhile,Ma Ying-jeou, former president of the Republic of China, began a 12-day ancestral worship tour to China on March 27, his first trip to the mainland.
Yet none of these events could match the return of Jack Ma, one of the most prominent Chinese entrepreneurs, the founder of multinational technology giant Alibaba, and the exiled bad boy of China's business community.
Jack Ma is back.
At 1:00 p.m. on March 27, 2023, five hours after Bloomberg released a tweet noting, ”Beijing wants to show it’s backing private businesses, but Ma’s decision to stay overseas suggests otherwise”, China's STAR Market app announced that inside a tunnel in Hangzhou, a witness took video of Jack Ma sitting in a van (Figure 1). At 2:00 p.m., Yungu Education WeChat public account released an article on Jack Ma's visit to Hangzhou Yungu School (a private school invested in by Alibaba Partners). In this moment, Ma was confirmed as returning to China.
What kind of signal does Ma's return send?
The intense attention on Ma shows that the billionaire business tycoon still has great influence, and to some extent, Ma represents the confidence in the private economy and foreign investment in China. However, there are two completely different interpretations of his arrival in China, "RETURN" or "RETREAT".
Chinese social media mostly interpreted his return as positive. Today, China's economic outlook is full of uncertainty, and its private sector urgently needs some reassurance. Ma's return shows that the policy environment for the private sector has improved. But many foreign media outlets, like Bloomberg, remain skeptical. They are concerned about the long-term political risks of Beijing's influence on day-to-day business operations. Others assume that Ma's return is some kind of a deal, a stopgap measure to win the hearts and minds of China's private sector, and question how long Ma will stay in China this time.
Although the Chinese government has not directly issued any direct comments on Ma's return, we can still tell from Premier Li Qiang's remarks made at the China-Foreign Entrepreneurs Dialogue on March 30 (1):
1. The Chinese government has been and will always be encouraging the development of the private economy.
2. There is nothing wrong with the previous measures against Alibaba.
In the table below, we have compiled the timeline from October 2020, when Ma delivered his troublesome speech (our November 22, 2022 post) to his return to China in 2023. From a series of events that happened after December 2022, we can see that  Ma's coming back was a matter of course. However, as we've pointed out previously (January 21, 2021 post), this shouldn't have been the news in a sound business environment where people don't see ordinary things as extraordinary.
Now that Ma is back, it does not mean that the business environment for China's private enterprises has been fundamentally improved. Entrepreneurs still face  unprecedented challenges in a world of turmoil and transformation; instability and uncertainty have become the norm. Perhaps more telling than the Ma's return is the actual situation on the ground, in the bank accounts and balance sheets, which will still take time to recover.
The first stop? Yungu
On the afternoon of March 27, the news that Jack Ma showed up at Hangzhou Yungu School (a private school invested by Alibaba Partners) appeared on social media. According to the description, Jack Ma walked the school thoroughly this time.
Ma used to be an English teacher, and he has said that he wished to return to school to teach again someday. Picking Yungu for his debut was a well-thought-out choice:
First and foremost, the key is to convey the message that Ma is now in China.Second, it is not suitable now for Ma to point his fingers at Alibaba's business or China's economic policies.Third, he had to say something, otherwise it will cause controversy. For Ma, ChatGPT is an ideal topic, sounding like he is still wise and thoughtful, and at the same time, it will not trigger undesired comments and judgments.

The biggest risk of the choice is to overexpose Yungu, an aristocratic school. Its annual tuition fees (2) range from ￥130,000（$19,000) to ￥200,000（$29,000), and most of their students are expected attend university outside China.
It seems that the visit was made by someone who just ended his hibernation, and had sensed some undercurrent at work. People want to see Ma's next move.
The reorganization of Alibaba Group
Just one day after the news of Ma’s return, Alibaba Group announced a "1+6+N" reorganization plan. This most significant reorganization in the Chinese e-commerce giant’s history will see Alibaba become a holding group and split its core businesses into six different business groups, each led by a separate CEO and board that are empowered to bring in outside capital or list publicly, and other smaller business units.
The six groups are:
1. Cloud Intelligence Group, including cloud, AI, DingTalk and other businesses, with Daniel Zhang serving as CEO;
2. Taobao Tmall Business Group, including Taobao, Tmall, Taobao Deals, Taocaica\i, 1688.com, and other businesses, with Trudy Dai serving as CEO;
3. Local Services Group, including Amap, Ele.me, and other businesses, with Yongfu Yu serving as CEO;
4. Global Digital Business Group including Lazada, AliExpress, Trendyol, Daraz, Alibaba.com, and other businesses, with Fan Jiang serving as CEO;
5. Cainiao Smart Logistics with Lin Wan serving as CEO;
6. Digital Media and Entertainment Group including Youku, Alibaba Pictures, and other businesses, with Luyuan Fan serving as CEO.
A mammoth enterprise with annual revenue of $134.6 billion and 230,000 employees, Alibaba's reorganization would simplify its hierarchy and shorten the decision chain, improve efficiency, and speed up response to market needs. It is hoped that the independent operation of these business groups will improve efficiency and performance, and revive the long-depressed stock price. Another apparent benefit of the plan is to remove a long-time regulatory overhang. Beijing’s obvious anti-monopoly concern is that Alibaba has become too large and too influential.
The headwinds facing  Alibaba are a combination of slowing growth of China's economy, anti-monopoly regulations that have helped Alibaba’s competitors, as well as geopolitical risks stemming from intensifying tensions between China and the United States.
From an industry perspective, with its saturation of China's mobile internet market and the expansion of its organizational scale, Alibaba has become a “traditional company”. Alibaba's major businesses are facing fierce competition. According to the latest earnings data, only two out of Alibaba's six business groups are profitable, and so there could be some consequences to dismembering the company. Taobao Tmall Business Group (e-commerce) is the cornerstone of the Alibaba empire, cash cow and major source of profit. From Pinduoduo to Douyin, younger competitors continue to encroach Taobao Tmall market with newer business models, better customer experience, and faster responses,
Alibaba's domestic e-commerce market share has dropped from 70% in 2018 to less than 50% in 2022. The Chinese government's anti-monopoly measures have had a considerable impact during the process. The Cloud Intelligence Group, which will be headed by Daniel Zhang, Chairman and CEO of Alibaba Group, is the second most profitable business group. In 2022, Alibaba Cloud ranked first with a market share of 36% in China. Although its revenue increased by 7.6% year-on-year to ￥75.3 billion ($10.9 billion), its market share decreased by 2.7%. Alibaba's other four major business units are currently losing money or playing catch-up in their respective industry segments.
It seems that Alibaba's leaders don't think that their company, an elephant with other businesses carried by Taobao Tmall, can dance with wolves. We can't speculate whether the reorganization will work or not, but one thing is certain: the management wants to reinvigorate the entrepreneurial mentality of Alibaba's fans.
It is hard to imagine that a reorganization of such scale will happen without Jack Ma's approval, perhaps this is why Jack Ma has to show up in Hangzhou at this moment.
Jack Ma and his era
In 2020, after ANT Group's IPO was suspended, an article published on people.cn, reported, “There is no so called Jack Ma's era, but Jack Ma in his time”（没有所谓的马云的时代，只有时代中的马云), sparking widespread discussion on Chinese social media.
People like Ma have lived successfully in China's reform and opening period, they have created world class enterprises like Alibaba, and they have written the history of the internet in China. Also, they have become the most glorious entrepreneurs of their era. While China's reform and opening up has provided them with opportunities, they have also changed contemporary China.
Market vitality comes from people, especially from entrepreneurs and entrepreneurship. Over the past 40 years, the remarkable development of China's economy, the improvement of people's livelihoods, and the enhancement of national power are closely related to the continuous stimulation of economic vitality and the growth of entrepreneurs in China. The more challenges to China's economy, the more it is necessary to carry forward the spirit of entrepreneurship, give full play to the role of entrepreneurs, and press for more dynamic development of enterprises. Proven entrepreneurs are scarce resources in China, and China would do well not to destroy them. Instead, China's homegrown entrepreneurs should be protected and encouraged, and the rewards will be substantial.
1. Translation of Li Qiang's original words: "Whether legally or at the policy level, we have never changed the basic national policy of opening up to the outside world. However, we have noticed that in recent years, there have indeed been some biases in public opinion, including our punishment for non-compliance of some private enterprises, which was originally only for specific enterprise and specific non-compliant behavior, but some public opinions were biased, as if they were (targeted) against certain type of enterprise. We've never been like this. We penalize non-compliant behavior, not against any type of enterprise, including foreign-funded enterprises. What we are emphasizing now is to treat all enterprises equally.
