### China's Supply Chain & Innovation: The Case of Brilliant Labs

3 November 2021|China
AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy and, in particular, life in China. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. We have sought to advance a conversation about the U.S.-China relationship, and a deep understanding of local economic development in China. We have written a series about the strategic strength oflocal economic development in China’s 2nd and 3rd tier citiesandentrepreneurship in China todayas well as a series aboutChina’s Belt and Road Initiative. More recently, we have been writing about the U.S.-China Trade War as it relates toinnovation in the Chinese economy. This post adds to that conversation. – The Editorial Team
Recently, an old friend, Bobak Tavangar, joined one of my executive classes to share his experiences of doing business in China. Bobak has lived in Asia for many years, several years in Shanghai and now living in Malaysia. Prior to launching his venture,Brilliant Labs, with his business partner, Ben Heald, Bobak worked for Apple in China. Bobak was part of Apple’s Supplier Responsibility division, which is a part of Operations. While there, he developed intimate knowledge of China’s supply chain. During his appearance in my executive seminar, Bobak dropped several insights that are relevant for our discussions of Chinese innovation (discussed previously on OGLhereandhere) and the power of China’s supply chain and development model (discussed previously on OGLhereandhere).
Before going deeper on the case ofBrilliant Labsand Bobak’s insights, a little review on the OGL theory of what makes China’s manufacturing supply chain remarkable. We have written previously about the underlying logic of China’s powerful supply chain and three key features that make China’s manufacturing supply chain so special. First, there is the labor supply. China’s “floating population” [liudong renkou] – an internal migrant labor force of some 300 million workers – is an incredible resource for factories throughout China. To be clear, Chinese labor is no longer that cheap; the key feature is that it is a mobile migrant labor force, organized by the State-backed dispatch labor system. Other countries (e.g., India) have deep labor pools, but no country organizes the flow of these labor forces the way China does. (Think of an immaculately organized temp labor force for the manufacturing sector.) Second, China has built a large amount of its infrastructure in the service of linking together the national network of suppliers in the manufacturing sector. For China, infrastructure has not just been about buildings, bridges, and high-speed rail (despite what we read about Evergrande); it has also been about building the roads and ports that link China’s suppliers together and to the world. Third, China’s local governments have done a fabulous job of creating local industrial clusters. Following the work of Andrew Walder, we think of these local initiatives as “local governments and industrial firms,” where local governments are given incentives to develop local political economies around specific industries, components, modules, devices, final assembly, and countless others.
To illuminate this dynamic in a specific case, here is one of my favorite statistics: Apple controls about 25% of the smartphone market share in the world. Yet, among such esteemed competitors as Samsung, Huawei, Xiaomi, Oppo, Vivo, and others, Apple takes about 85-90% of the profits in this market segment. Yes, 85-90%, meaning 10% of the profits in the smartphone segment are divided among everyone else.[1]
Most people assume this is because of product differences, but that is not the case. Amazingly, in my own experience with research and executive education at Apple, even Apple executives, whom one would think understand the business model as well as anyone, widely assume this difference is largely because of product superiority. Instead, however, the story is really about supply chain management, and China’s manufacturing supply chain has some advantages that cannot be replicated anywhere in the world.
The common perception of China’s success over the last four decades is one of a deep and cheap labor pool. However, it is also true that China and its foreign partners have builtthemost flexible and innovative supply chain in the world, and companies that manage that supply chain effectively can capitalize on it to great profit. So why is Apple so profitable? Because the company does an amazing job of negotiating with multiple suppliers and forcing them to compete with each other for Apple business (which is undeniably a high-volume business). These suppliers then use the knowledge they gain from Apple operations engineers and then turn around and charge Apple competitors premium prices for the same – or very similar – components. Hence the disparity in profitability.
But let’s think about what this means. Most people (including the former US President, Donald Trump) seem to think that Foxconn builds Apple’s products, but Foxconn is only a final assembly (FATP) partner. In practice, Apple works with many suppliers across China and the world in the mining of rare earths and the building of components, modules, and final assembly. For every mining resource, component, module, or final assembly process, there are multiple suppliers competing for this business. So, the idea that companies like Apple or Tesla could simply build an FATP factory in Wisconsin (or somewhere in Vietnam or India) completely misunderstands the complexity of China’s integrated supply chain.
Back to Bobak and Brilliant Labs. While Bobak was passionate about his Supplier Responsibility work at Apple, he also has the creative entrepreneur in him, and he wanted to create something transformative. After leaving Apple, he teamed up with another Shanghai ex-pat, Ben Heald, and created Brilliant Labs. These entrepreneurs are creative thinkers who are looking for the next transformative technology. They settled on Augmented Reality. But, instead of the big, clunky goggles that take up half of your face, they conceived of a small, elegant fixture that would fit over one lens of a pair of glasses.
Bobak sounds a bit like a young Steve Jobs when he talks about the vision he and Ben had. However, their work also required a creative approach to managing the supply chain for components that go into the augmented reality lens Brilliant Labs is building. Bobak visited scores of suppliers to find a fit with each supplier for a given component that would fit into his complex augmented reality lens. The beauty of China for entrepreneurs like Bobak and Ben is that there are clusters of suppliers for any and every component you can imagine. And often there is a supplier that does exactly the same thing right down the street (this is the logic of industrial clusters) – and they compete with each other creating a true market at each stage of the industrial production process. If you are an entrepreneur trying to build a product, you can pick an area for a given component, visit several potential suppliers, negotiate over price – and if you are doing it well, force the suppliers to compete with each other – and choose a partner for a given component. And you do this over and over again for each component in the product, Bobak said.
An additional fascinating nugget that Bobak shared with my class was that Brilliant Labs would like to think broadly about the business it is doing in terms of global supply chains. He wanted to find the best components from anywhere the company could get them, including bringing business to American suppliers. But his answer was a little sad for American manufacturing.
First, Bobak talked about the bureaucracy of doing business in America, especially in the tech sector. Without invoking specific names, he told stories about “being served with ITAR documents before even exchanging pleasantries. Some suppliers even went so far as to warn us not to use a ‘foreign language’ in our written interactions with them because they would refuse to interact with us further if we did (I’m American and Ben is British so no one was using anything but English).  Finally, the American suppliers wanted written assurances that we were not in violation of federal regulations – Department of Treasury or Department of Defense.  Again, all of this before ‘Hello’. In terms of what is reasonable, we were patient with the documentation/requirements above (sadly, something we have to get used to as Americans) but the preemptive refusal to engage with a foreign language ‘or else’ was unsettling, especially given the global economy we live in today. The whole experience – from the unprovoked/preemptive nature of it all, to the repeated invocation of various punitive government measures, to the generally aggressive posture – felt like interacting with a country at war.”
He then compared this to the reception of his young company by Chinese suppliers. According to Bobak, “the Chinese suppliers were engaged, friendly, had a ‘can-do’ attitude, and extremely entrepreneurial.” (Remember our discussion of industrial clusters above – these suppliers have significant incentives to figure out how to work with a potential client, because that client might just go across the road to work with a competitor.) If this sounds like the contrast between a rules-bound bureaucracy (the US) and a hungry entrepreneurism (China), it is. Ironically, the world’s largest communist economy is winning in the area of entrepreneurialism. As Bobak put it, “the contrast was indeed stark.”
Finally, inevitably in sectors like this, especially as they relate to China, some pundits and critics will raise the issue of intellectual property theft and the dangers of dealing with China for these reasons. Not surprisingly, Brilliant Labs also worries about issues like these. However, they have a solution: they source components from China but then final assembly takes place in Singapore. With an integrated Asian supply chain, such solutions are not only viable, but also elegant.
In any case, we will conclude here: Over the last forty years, China has constructed a remarkable manufacturing supply chain – one that has created powerful industrial clusters and one that has created opportunity for large players like Apple and smaller entrepreneurial players like Brilliant Labs. There are many concerns and questions about the direction China is going under the current administration. However, China’s supply chain is still the most robust and entrepreneurial in the world.
