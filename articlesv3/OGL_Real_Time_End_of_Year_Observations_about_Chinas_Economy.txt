### OGL Real Time: End-of-Year Observations about China’s Economy

2 January 2022|China, China politics, Economic Development
On Global Leadership's feature, OGL Real Time, presents our up-to-the-minute insights on current news and events. We hope these breaking news insights from our OGL team members will help illuminate the events of the day and provide the depth needed to understand global political, economic and cultural transitions and transformations. This post explores the dialogue occurring inside of China surrounding China’s end-of-year economic status and its economic prognosis for 2022.

Question 1: What is your perspective on the over-arching tone of this conference. I know through some of my conversations with the OGL China Team, you felt like the articulation was a somewhat pessimistic view in three key areas. Can you lay these out for our readers?
Economic stability will be the top priority of China's policymakers for 2022. The top leadership recently acknowledged that the country is facing pressure from:
A contraction of demandSupply shocksWeaker expectations
• A contraction of demand
• Supply shocks
• Weaker expectations
The annual Central Economic Work Conference, which concluded on Dec 10, 2021, pledged to safeguard economic stability amid rising domestic and external challenges. It unusually painted a gloomy outlook and mentioned “stability (稳)” 25 times throughout the conference's news release. It is either a communication style change or the top is seeing real difficulties ahead, so they want to give a serious warning.
The shrinking demand mainly refers to two aspects. One is the lack of growth in household consumption so far, and the other is that the strict regulations on real estate and local government debt have significantly affected the growth rate of real estate and infrastructure investments. Supply shocks refers to the significant increase in global commodity prices in the context of a mismatch of supply and demand, which has caused negative effects on middle and downstream companies. The weakening of expectations relates to the current micro entities’ expectations of the short-term economic growth and market expansion.
At present, there are at least three external instability factors in China:
First, the COVID-19 pandemic with new strains emerging one after another, so the intensity of the prevention situation in 2022 is still severe;
Second, in the context of U.S. domestic inflation, the Federal Reserve may reduce debt purchases and raise interest rates in 2022. Usually when the Fed tightens monetary policy, China may face short-term capital outflows, depreciation of the RMB against the U.S. dollar, and increased foreign currency debt burden;
Third, global commodity prices remain high, which will bring imported inflation into the Chinese economy.
Top policymakers at the meeting decided that supportive policies should be implemented ahead of schedule, and all regions and departments should actively roll out policies conducive to economic stability. Between now and the Chinese New Year, we believe they will roll out supportive measures to shore up growth against strong headwinds and will likely set 5% as the bottom line for GDP growth for 2022. All the annual goals will be officially proved by the next congress meeting in early March 2022.
The emphasis on economic stability signals that China will pursue a more pro-growth policy to avoid deep economic slowdown, as it is likely to face strong downward pressure. We expect the government will intensify fiscal spending to boost domestic demand and increase infrastructure investment. We also expect them to fine-tune regulatory measures that came down in last summer in the financial and energy sectors in order to stabilize production and growth.
Question 2: So, let’s go deeper on consumption and the Double Circulation Economy. How important is the building of a consumption-based economic growth plan within all of these dynamics?
Expanding domestic demand has been proposed as a strategy move in China's 14th Five-Year Plan (14th FYP). China is now in a stage of high-quality development, its main features are：
The GDP growth rate has dropped from 8% a decade ago to less than 6%.China’s economic structure is changing rapidly, and consumption is playing an increasing role in the economic growth. In GDP by expenditure approach, the contribution rate of final consumption expenditure is 54.3%, while capital formation is 43.1%.The driving force of economic development has shifted from capital, labor, and land to innovation and human resource.

• The driving force of economic development has shifted from capital, labor, and land to innovation and human resource.
Meanwhile, Beijing is very vigilant about the external environment, projecting that the international economic and political landscapes will remain complex and fast-changing：
The international environment is growing more complicated, with a noticeable rise in instability and uncertainty;The universal impact of COVID-19 is significant, and the world economy has slumped into recession;Economic globalization is enduring a backlash, global supply chain and demand have shifted dramatically;The global energy supply and demand landscape has undergone profound changes.
• The international environment is growing more complicated, with a noticeable rise in instability and uncertainty;
• The universal impact of COVID-19 is significant, and the world economy has slumped into recession;
• Economic globalization is enduring a backlash, global supply chain and demand have shifted dramatically;
• The global energy supply and demand landscape has undergone profound changes.
Therefore, from now until to 2035, China’s goal is to accelerate the cultivation of a domestic demand system, to create new demand through innovation and high-quality supply, and move to "a new pattern of development that focuses on domestic circulation and features positive interplay between domestic circulation and international circulation"(1).
Domestic demand consists of both consumption and investment. China will adopt the following strategies to expand domestic demand during the 14th FYP period:
Improve the quality of physical consumption and increase residents' consumption in services.Comparing the data of 2020 and 2014, we can see that although China's per-capita disposable income has increased faster than per capita GDP, the growth rate of household consumption expenditure was 13.2% lower than disposable income growth. The food consumption and durable consumer goods ownership has indicated that the growth of residents' basic living consumption will slow down. New demands for consumer products is evolving in the pursuit of higher quality and new products; for example, the growth in the consumption of beef, fruit, and nuts in food. The growth rate of service consumption expenditure, especially of medical and health section, far exceeds the growth rate of household consumption expenditure.
Optimize investment structure and improve investment efficiency.After the 2021 Central Economic Work Conference proposed to appropriately advance infrastructure construction，"new infrastructure" should be the “appropriate” infrastructure investment in 2022. Projects in digital, smart, and low-carbon areas such as industrial Internet platforms, solar power, energy storage etc are easy to obtain funding. However, it is generally believed that new infrastructure accounts for less than 10% of total infrastructure investment. How to stabilize traditional infrastructure and real estate investment is the key to maintaining economic growth in 2022.
China is not short of housing from average housing area per household. Real estate projects in areas with an influx of population, especially tier 1 and tier 2 cities, are still considered as profitable and high-quality projects and thus should be supported. In traditional infrastructure, local governments are reluctant and concerned about excessive debt. Therefore, the central government should be proactive in supporting projects with long-term benefits, though insignificant short-term gains.

Question 3: Moving away from the economic development issues a bit: Carbon emission issue — long term
The annual Central Economic Work Conference has re-tuned the energy policy from an aggressive curbing of coal usage three months ago to a more balanced approach in order to save the economy.
The meeting statement emphasized the need to have a proper understanding of the country's carbon peak and carbon neutrality goals (3060). The phase-out of traditional energy in China should be based on safe, reliable new energy alternatives. It needs to first strengthen the clean and efficient use of coal, increase the absorptive capacity of new energy, and then optimize the use of coal and new energy.
The meeting also added a corrective term that the newly-added renewable energy and energy used as raw materials would be excluded from the cap on total energy consumption, a shift from controlling energy consumption amount and intensity to controlling the amount and intensity of carbon emissions. The earlier controlling mechanism has ruled out and chased away many investment opportunities both from domestic and abroad.
