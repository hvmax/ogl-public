### Revisiting Authentic Leadership, Part I: Unfiltered & Knowable

25 November 2020|Leadership, Leadership Development, Organizational systems
This is the first in a three-part series that revisits authentic leadership. To begin, we stake out here some of the general history of the concept, looking back 2,500 years to  the philosophers of ancient Greece. We then fast-forward to the past five decades of academic analysis and research, primarily in the fields of sociology and educational and business psychology. Despite the many attempts by researchers to demonstrate the utility and relevance of specific components of authenticity for leadership development, a recent trend has been to dismiss the concept altogether as unhelpful and even misleading for leaders and as a basis for leadership development. Still, questions remain whether the premises of much contemporary research and other discussions may be too limiting and could recommend other, more potentially constructive ways to approach and apply the concept to leadership.
The authentic leader is a Straw Man. As a figure in popular discussions of management, particularly in social media, that is largely true. Unfortunately, it is also often the case in more systematic research and reflective studies. Yet like many contested terms in management,authentic leadershiprefers to a tangled set of debates and defining factors. Several Straw Men, that is, emerge when authentic leadership is invoked, defended, attacked, or simply searched for. The aim here is to chart some of the complicated (and sometimes contradictory) aspects of authentic leadership. It is done with the belief that, despite being doubted or even dismissed by critics, many of them thoughtful and well-intentioned, the prospect of gaining a clearer and practical understanding of authenticity in one’s life and leadership can still have value.
The idea of authenticity has roots stretching back to ancient Greek philosophy and it is epitomized by phrases likeknow thyself. Awareness and knowledge of oneself remains a core variable in most approaches to authentic leadership. Yet it is not unproblematic. Setting aside the meanings of the self in non-Western traditions of thought, a reasonable question to pose is how understanding of the self has shifted in the millennia since Socrates. As described below, the Enlightenment brought to the Western world new conceptions of selfhood marked by altered relationships between the individual and their consciousness, others, the natural world, and God. More than an abstract exercise in intellectual history, tracking these changes affords a valuable appreciation for leaders of how the current predominant framework of the individual self, and notions of authenticity constructed around it, is not somehow innately human or unchangeable.
More recently, authenticity emerged amidst the sweeping social and cultural changes following the Second World War. In the 1960s, particularly, self-understanding, transparency, and expression in the face of social and institutional norms become priorities for many in public and organizational life. While challenging often stifling and outdated social and institutional norms, like that of the preceding decade’s “organization man,” that individual and, especially, internal focus on the self-produced what some characterized as the “Me generation.” In 1976, sociologist Daniel Bell decried that, “American culture had become primarily hedonistic, concerned with play, fun, display, and pleasure – and, typical of things in America, in a compulsive way”. Observing the Enlightenment thinking that allowed his contemporaries to make happiness “a political factor,” Bell criticized the era’s “megalomania of self-infinitization”. Such changes in individual thinking and development, Bell and his contemporaries argued, illuminated profoundly damaging effects on social interactions, public and organizational life, and common bonds of values and beliefs.
Paralleling the macro-level analyses and commentaries at the time were increasing empirical efforts to examine, particularly in the field of psychology, specific aspects of individual self-understanding and ways of relating to others and situations under the banner of “authenticity.” In the early 1980s, education researchers James Henderson and Wayne Hoy introduced the “Leadership Authenticity Scale,” a 32-item measure based on subordinates’ perceptions of a leader’s (for them, a school principal’s) accountability, manipulation of subordinates, and salience of the leader’s self over their job title or role. Importantly, the instrument sought to contextualize the leadership authenticity in terms of both the relationship with subordinates and the existence of a positive organizational climate. Yet at its core was a belief in the individual’s genuine actions. As two commentators put it at the time, “Supervisors will be effective if their behavior with teachers is based not on what they think others expect of them, but on their own genuine wants and needs” (Pajak & Seyfarth 1983).
During the 2000s, authentic leadership was squarely embraced by management thinkers and researchers for its relevance to leadership development. Bill George, the former CEO of Medtronic and then a professor at the Harvard Business School,argued in several booksduring the decade that knowing one’s authentic self entailed learning to be self-aware. George described the discovery of one’s “true north,” “the internal compass that guides you successfully through life,” as the basis for purposeful leadership and meaningful engagement with others. Researchers Bruce Avolio and William Gardner, both then at the University of Nebraska, summarized in 2005 the burgeoning field of “Authentic Leadership Development.” Drawing on several strands of thinking and practice, from self-actualization in humanistic psychology to educational leadership models to positive psychological capacities, the authors claim that the development of authentic leaders can relate to sustainable organizational performance.
Led by American management psychologist Fred Walumbwa, five scholars introduced theAuthentic Leadership Questionnaire(ALQ) in 2008. The “theory-based measure” drew together various factors that had emerged in previous research to assess a subject’s authenticity. Its four defining dimensions are self-awareness, unbiased processing, relational transparency, and the concordance between behavior and values (“Internalized Moral Perspective”). That they were set as discrete attributes measurable by a questionnaire provided a clearer conception of how the expansive topic of authenticity might be approached. At the same time, such definitions lent themselves to simplification and reduction of a complex idea to fixed factors. The validity of outcomes became a problem for the ALQ, however, and the University of Miami’s Linda Neider and Chester Schriesheim introduced a subsequent, revised measure, theAuthentic Leadership Inventoryin 2011. A key difference was to distinguish outcomes based on responses to specific questions into separate scales for authentic leadership and for those attributes and behaviors associated with transformational leadership.
This shift toward focusing less on a singular measure or standard of authenticity continued in the 2010s. Wharton professor Adam Grant wrote in a 2016 New York Times column, which asserted that, “‘Be Yourself’ is terrible advice.” The first reason he cited tied being authentic to the personality trait variable of lowself-monitoring. While a less inhibited or filtered expression of our thoughts, feelings, or other inner states might in principle be encouraged, research shows such a lack of social awareness is not generally rewarded in professional life or personal relationships. Grant’s second reason was the seemingly common-sense recognition that “being yourself” requires afixed self, which is hard to reconcile with processes of learning and growth. Similarly, when Columbia psychologist Scott Barry Kaufman wrote about “a lack of consensus among both the general public and among psychologists about what it actually means for someone or something to be authentic,” the “thorniest issue” is the problem posed for scientific investigators by the core notion of a “real” or “true” self (2019). Like Grant, he sees these problematic constitutive elements of authenticity as reasons to leave behind the priority of our inner self and, with it, the preoccupation with being authentic to that self.
Another insightful researcher, London Business School psychologist Tomas Chamorro-Premuzic, has likewiseassailed the possibility and importance of authenticity, calling out both our human inability to know ourselves and the greater comparative priority of leaders’ competence and caring. That latter critique pushed back directly against what has emerged as a frequent tendency in popular accounts to equate authenticity with unfiltered communication and interactions with others. For psychologist and consultant Karissa Thacker, this represents “Popeye’s view of authenticity”: “I am what I am.”Low monitoring and little or no filtering enables individuals to just be themselves, regardless of others or social contexts. It is what Grant, in a 2020 article, calledauthenticity “without boundaries.” It is also the lazy leader’s approach to authenticity, as Thacker puts it. In joining this chorus of condemnation, we might equally describe it as the lazy leadership analyst’s approach to being an authentic leader or person.
Reviewing and determining the lack of viability of each these potential variables – low monitoring or filtering, requiring a fixed or true self, the inability to know oneself, having a lack of boundaries with others, extreme individualism – suggests, as critics do, that the larger category of authenticity is inadequate. Yet the term persists. Freighted with optimism around the human potential of leaders,authenticitycan seem more a self-help cure-all for what ails leaders despite failing tests as an empirical building block for leadership development. Besides its warm-and-fuzzy connotation, authenticity remains entrenched in our cultural imagination as the necessary foil of fakeness, the true and unadulterated essence to contrast the falseness and compromise found elsewhere. The contrast seems as relevant to leaders as it is to a range of other people, products, and brands, to food and music, artistic expressions and travel experiences. While that contrast may itself be artificial and even irrational, people’s ardent belief in its meaning may suggest that theempiricaltesting – and summary refutation – of authentic leadership may not be all there is to the story.
What else could justify authenticity? One possibility would be to broaden the lens on which research we consult beyond that related to work places, interactions, and performance. Instead, for example, we might consider findings in personality and social psychology. To be sure, authenticity as a concept is still debated these fields around many of the same questions raised around leaders: the existence of an innate self, the possibility of uncovering it, and how it relates to happiness or fulfillment. But the emphasis is on people showing up in life as their whole selves rather than in culturally prescribed or delimited ways. University of Houston psychologist Brené Brown’s definition of authenticity – which she summarized in a response to Grant’s 2016 article – is apposite here. She has “found thatthe core of authenticity is the courage to be imperfect, vulnerable, and to set boundaries.” That courage is vital both to an individual’s growth and his or her relationships with others. Brown even asserts that, “We need braver, more authentic leaders. We need cultures that support the idea that vulnerability is courage and also the birthplace of trust, innovation, learning, risk-taking, and having tough conversations.” In other words, the alternative would emphasize the value of bringing whole, integrated, and finally imperfect selves forward rather than assessing which essential parts – specific traits or behaviors – may or may not be keys to revealing an inner self.
Other possibilities might involve quite different perspectives. Consider the putative authenticity of actors, artists, and musicians. We will explore more fully how these figures and their fields relate to authenticity in the next installment of this series. For now, though, it is worth calling out the long history in each of these creative fields of authenticity as a marker for an evolving and performative, often symbolic, quality of individuals. Some of that quality may be akin to the integrated if imperfect selves described by Brown, with the added dimension that those selves are often brought into existence as creations for public audiences. Another perspective might pertain tothecraftsman, who, for sociologists like Richard Sennett, epitomizes individuals having a more reflexive and less transactional relationship with work. Though the products of craftsmen are often labeled as "authentic" for the marketplace, the acts and processes of craft production itself can be viewed as having both a cultural value and human meaning. That meaning derives from the specific bodily skills, technical understanding, and powers of imagination of an individual – perhaps an active and embodied basis for authenticity. Some researchers have even argued for an embodied “craft of leadership” that, by this logic, could speak to authenticity in leadership (Taylor & Ladkin 2014).
It is thePlatonic dialogue ofCharmidesthat describes “Know thyself” as the first of the maxims that appear at the Temple of Apollo at Delphi. The next two were “nothing to excess” and, more relevant here, quoting the pre-Socratic philosopher, Thales, “to bring surety brings ruin.” Authentic leadership may finally be too nebulous a category for today’s predominantly empirical management researchers. Yet it may nevertheless still help leaders to become aware of and evaluate other illuminating perspectives on themselves, their engagement with work, and their relationships with others. Similar to the “inside-out” view adopted by some firms, which take careful stock of their resources and capabilities instead of assessing users or competitors, the perspective of a leader understanding and acting upon their innate self still seems a necessary if not sufficient element of comprehending one’s authenticity. In the same cultural moment as Daniel Bell’s critique, in 1973, the theorist Theodor Adorno described the trend toward the extreme version of individualism and self-transparency as a “liturgy of inwardness.” Whether under the specific term ofauthenticityor as a general commitment to more active and reflective self-leadership, we do well today not to be excessive either in our faith in that inwardness or in trying to exorcise fixed formulations of that perspective altogether.
In the second entry in this series, we will look beyond narrowly fixed determinants of authenticity, particularly awareness and knowledge of an innate self, or measures of extreme individualism, like low monitoring and an internalized moral perspective. Instead, learning from the experiences of artists and musicians, our focus will be on the potential for leaders to make continuing efforts atauthenticationas ongoing processes of the active reflection and evolution of their multiple selves.
