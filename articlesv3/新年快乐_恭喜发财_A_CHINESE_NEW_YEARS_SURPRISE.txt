10 February 2024|China history, Chinese Culture
AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy and, in particular, life in China. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. We have sought to advance a conversation about the U.S.-China relationship, and a deep understanding of local economic development in China. In this post, we wish our readers a Happy Chinese New Year by sharing a recent experience of an event seeking to bring our two countries a little closer together. The event was a Chinese New Year Banquet hosted by Global Ties Arizona.
新年快乐, 恭喜发财. Happy New Year. May your year be happy and prosperous.
China and many Asian countries celebrate the Lunar New Year, or Chinese New Year, at this time of year. When I lived in China, it was a particularly exciting because the festivities were so colorful and widespread. The 15-day festival begins with the new moon, which this year is Feb. 10 in Western calendars, and it will run until the next full moon. Marked by celebrations, feasts, and special events, the festival honors households, ancestors, and deities.
Recently, I was asked to attend the Chinese New Year Banquet held by Global Ties, Arizona (GTA). I was asked to give a short keynote speech to the 300+ attendees. I quickly agreed. It seemed like a good way to spend time with a community of people I enjoy being with, and a good way to help welcome in the Year of the Dragon.
Global Ties, Arizona(GTA)is a nonprofit organization set up to attract visitors from and conduct exchanges with cities and countries all over the world. Founded in 1950 as the World Affairs Council of Phoenix, which was affiliated with the Nation Council for International Visitors (NCIV), the organization was built on the idea of internationalizing the City of Phoenix.
It went through several incarnations and name changes. Today, GTA has a rich, nearly 60-year history of fostering global connections for Arizonans through international exchange programs, community educational programs and special events”
As GTA Founder, J. Lester Shaffer, describes the mission, “People are people the world over… Once we share a meal or spend the day with a foreign visitor, we realize how alike we are and the differences between people melt away…” (here) Today, the organization, which is run in a visionary way by Executive Director Kristin Allen, is part of the network of nonprofits that sit under theGlobal Ties U.S.umbrella.
I have come to know GTA as one of their “China hands,” someone they call on when they need someone who knows something about China and to meet with visitors GTA might be hosting.
At the Chinese New Year event, I was seated at a table with a team from Phoenix’s Sister City, Chengdu, who had traveled to Phoenix to perform a dance at this event. Also at my table wereRita Marko, President and CEO of Phoenix Sister Cities, Inc., andChristina Mercado Gonzolez, Vice Chair of the Board of Global Ties, Arizona, who is also an alum of the Arizona-based school where I teach, theThunderbird School of Global Management.
As part of my invitation, I was invited to give one of the dinner speeches to help welcome the audience and briefly talk about how I had come to devote my life to studying China. As the event approached, I came to understand that the GTA leaders had something very specific in mind. Chairman of the GTA Board and the evening’s Master of Ceremonies,Barry Wong, would interview me. I was to answer in Chinese, and there would be a translator who would translate my answers from Chinese to English.
My thinking was, “OK, whatever you all need from me…” but I must admit I wasn’t sure how the five minutes would go, as I was having some trouble envisioning how this would be interesting. It turns out that Barry and the GTA team were brilliant. Barry foresaw the impact of the staged event and it was truly remarkable.
After introductions, Barry asked me to explain to the audience why I started studying Chinese as a college student more than three decades ago. Following the directions I was given, I answered in Chinese, and you could see the audience curiously watching me.One brief example of the interview can be found here.
As I ended the story of my college years, Barry let the translator finish, and then took the microphone and dramatically paused for a moment, then said said, “Did I just blow your minds, ladies and gentlemen? We’ve got an American of European ancestry, speaking Mandarin Chinese, we’ve got a Chinese American translating into English… And we’re all Americans… Embracing culture. Embracing culture.”
The audience erupted with applause. I stood there watching and thinking how brilliant this script was for getting across what GTA was all about.
After the event, I reflected on the fact that this was the most meaningful keynote address moment I had ever participated in. 新年快乐, 恭喜发财. Happy Year of the Dragon! May your year be happy and prosperous.
