AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy and, in particular, life in China. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. We have also written about thehistoryandcurrent stateof US-China relations. Recently, we have written about the 50th anniversary ofPresident Nixon's visit to Chinaand how U.S.-China relations have evolved over that period. In this time, it is impossible to not be considering the war on Ukraine and what is means for China and the transforming Geo-Political Ecosystem. In this post, we weigh into these issues.

It is never easy to talk about war in a utilitarian sense. People die in invasions and wars, and it seems strange to talk about these moments in terms that predict advantages for different players in the global economic system. However, in times like these, it is necessary to think through what the major players might bring to the table and how different players might affect or change the direction of the world.
Recently, there has been a good deal of writing on what China’s role has been in the past several months and what it should be in the weeks and months ahead. There are three basic camps of punditry and reporting emerging here:Group 1: China knew what was coming and is therefore complicit; Group 2: China is neutral in the conflict; and Group 3: China needs to be engaged as key negotiator.
Group 1:The argument is that China knew the invasion of Ukraine was coming and is therefore complicit in the invasion. Its detachment is further evidence of China’s growing alliance and friendship with Russia. Several reporters have reported that President Xi asked President Putin to hold off on the invasion until after the Olympics (China has denied this). But the tone here is that China is steadily moved closer and closer to Russia. As Frank FangwroteonThe Epoch Timeson March 7, “Russia and China are deepening their relationship, in ways previously unseen. Two weeks before the invasion, as Russia was drawing heavy international criticism for its plans to attack Ukraine, Putin and Xi proclaimed a ‘no limits’ partnership, a bilateral relationship ‘superior to political and military alliances of the Cold War era.’” There is also a speculative thread running through this group that connects the Ukraine war with China’s plans for Taiwan (again, with no evidence).
Group 2:China may not have conspired or facilitated Russia’s moves, but her decision to sit on the sidelines constitutes a dangerous game for China and for the world. Recently, the New York Times’ Thomas Friedmanweighed into the discussion, laying out the ways in which China might influence the world if it chooses to leverage its economic and political power to influence Russia in a positive direction. China should take this course, because peace and global trade have been very good for China since its economic opening in 1979. “Peace has been very good for China. Its continued growth depends on China’s ability to export to and learn from that world of steadily integrating and modernizing free markets,” Friedman noted. He also laid out the dangers for China if it continues down a neutral path, further pointing out the dangers for China, especially if tensions with Taiwan continue to grow.
Group 3: Finally, there are those who believe China should be engaged, won over, and encouraged to use its power to influence the outcome. While many remain deeply concerned with China’s seeming alliance with Russia or its neutrality, a few voices have sought to encourage engagement. For example, Australia’s Prime Minister Scott Morrison noted, "China has long claimed to have a role as one of the major powers in the world and to be a contributor to global peace and stability. No country will have a bigger impact on concluding this terrible war in Ukraine than China," (Reuters,March 7, reported by Byron Kaye). In a similar vein, the European Union’s High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Josep Borrell noted that, “China is a peace-loving country,” and “hopes the Chinese side can play its role in encouraging and bringing about a ceasefire, and in pushing the parties concerned to set foot on a path of negotiations and political settlement” (Xinhua,March 8).
Given the complexity and global importance of this tragedy, we at OGL fall fairly squarely into Group 3 – not only from a normative sense of how the worldshouldengage China to help end this crisis, but also in our reading of what China is aspiring to do.
Recently, in apostabout the 50th anniversary of President Nixon’s trip to China, we surmised that that trip may have been the beginning of laying the groundwork for a G2 – and eventual alliance between the world’s two most powerful economies and militaries. Fifty years ago, when Nixon visited Mao, China had a long road ahead to regain that type of role in the world. Today, China runs the second-largest (soon to be the largest) economy in the world and also houses the world’s largest military. But many inside of China still feel a lack of respect emanating from other advanced industrialized nations. China has never been honored with an invitation to the G7/G8, despite having one of the world’s most powerful economies (Russia was a member of the G8 before its invasion of Crimea). It is clear that China aspires to solidify its position as one of the world’s most powerful and important geopolitical forces.
What we believe China wants is engagement and recognition for its important position in the world. Yes, it is true that Xi met with Putin and an alliance seemed to be emerging. It is true that China abstained from the Security Council vote to condemn Russia’s actions. However, it is also true that China has built a position in the global economy that make it extremely interdependent with several major economies of the world. Take, for example, the U.S.-China relationship. Despite all of the discussion about China’s pivot away from the West, there is simply no way our two economies can de-link from each other.
Let’s look at a few examples – Apple, Tesla, and Walmart. Apple and Tesla are two of the most valuable publicly traded companies in the world (Apple No. 1, Tesla No. 7). For both Apple and Tesla, China is their second-largest market behind the United States. Both companies generate about 25% of their revenues in China. But this is not just about sales and revenues that would be lost if China and the United States somehow stopped collaborating. It’s about the manufacturing supply chain. Quite simply, these two powerfully innovative companies depend so heavily on China’s supply chain, that, in our opinion, there is no alternative for them. There are other suppliers that build the components, modules, and final assembly processes in other nations, but the massive scale and the integrated nature of China’s supply chain make it impossible to reproduce this system outside of China.
Let’s step beyond the high-tech sectors and look at light industry goods and the “big box” retailers. Walmart and Home Depot, both DJIA companies, are less dependent on the technical prowess of China’s manufacturing supply chain, but still very dependent on the sheer scale of China’s manufacturing supply chain. By revenues, Walmart is the single largest company in the world. Walmart is also the single largest exporter from China to the United States. Home Depot is not a large as Walmart, but in the top 20 of the F500 rankings. And, like Walmart, China is the single largest producer of Home Depot products for shipment to the United States and around the world. If we suddenly reached a cooling of relations, Walmart, Home Depot, and many other “big box” retailers would be hurt tremendously. Even as the manufacturing process of these important companies is simpler than the likes of Apple and Tesla, they would also struggle to find a supply chain that would mirror what can be produced at scale in China.
Bottom line: If relations between China and the United States spiraled into an economic gorge, several of the United States’ most valuable companies would take a huge hit. And for a country that often judges the strength of its economy on the strength of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, this would not be good for anyone.
China has been wise and discrete in its approach to developing economic alliances in the West, as well as with nations such as Russia and North Korea. Interestingly, China is the largest trading partner with both Russia, Ukraine,andthe United States and the EU. For that reason alone, China is in a rare position to play negotiator at a time of crisis and import. Superpowers rise to the moment, and this opportunity would not only benefit China’s prestige but also its economy.
Our main point here is that it is very unlikely China and the United States could or would de-link economically. China has as much leverage over the U.S. as we have over them. So, the only real choice is engagement. And that brings us back to our reading of what China wants today and to what it is trying to achieve during the current crisis. We feel strongly that Morrison and Borrell are striking the right tone. The fact that Borrell directly engaged Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi was critical, believing that China playing a central role in helping to resolve the current crisis is optimum for Ukraine, China, and the world. If China wants to be “a” if not “the” global superpower, the world needs China to follow through on what comes with that power.
As we have written in a number of other posts, China wants respect and wants to be treated as a leader on the global stage (see, e.g.,hereandhere). Together with China, the United States, and the EU can negotiate their way out of this crisis. But instead of fomenting about President Xi’s meeting with Putin, why not create the G2 (US+China) or G3 (US+China+EU) and get on with the negotiations? And, President Biden, this is not a time to send in Secretary of State Blinken. This is a time for leadership from you. What’s it going to be, President Biden?
