AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy and, in particular, life in China. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. We have written a series about the strategic strength oflocal economic development in China’s 2nd and 3rd tier citiesandentrepreneurship in China today. We have written aboutinnovation in the Chinese economyandeconomic developmentas it relates tosocial inequality. We have also written about thestrategy and logic of local economic development in China’s reform era. This post adds to that conversation.

In previous posts, we have written about the local economic development strategies of China’s provinces and cities. One of China’s most famous development stories is the city of Shenzhen, which was transformed after it was named China’s first Special Economic Zone (SEZ) in China's era of economic opening (经济开放).
Bordering Hong Kong to the south, Shenzhen is a fishing village-turned-metropolis. The city was created in 1980 and it is now one of a handful tier 1 cities in mainland China (1). In 2020, Shenzhen’s US$401.6 billion GDP was equivalent to that of Israel, surpassing South Africa and Vietnam (2). Thanks to native tech companies, such as Huawei, Tencent, BYD, DJI, ZTE etc., the city has been called “the Silicon Valley of China.” The success of Silicon Valley is closely linked to an ecosystem that included world famous universities like Stanford and Berkeley. So having a university with the prestige of Stanford is what Shenzhen has sought.
Higher education is one of the most competitive industries in the United States. American universities have nurtured talent in the U.S. and globally. They have also developed and patented a large number of top-notch technologies. Their academic approach and systems have been widely admired, studied and referenced by other countries. But the Chinese are catching up.
For thousands of years, education has been valued highly in Chinese culture. In the last forty years, China’s economic development has allowed the country to invest heavily in the higher education. Most recently, social changes within America are reducing the attractiveness to Chinese students who might have dreamed of studying abroad in America. Meanwhile, as the 21st century has unfolded, the ambition of higher education development driven by local governments in the eastern coastal areas has been changing the landscape of China's higher education, a key example is in Shenzhen.
The Ministry of Education (MOE) often comes up with some like of list to rate the universities under its administration. In the past there were the “985” rating and “211” list. The most current one is a list on the school and the major called “Double First Class” (3). In this list of Double First Class universities announced in 2017, none is located in Shenzhen. So, the reality of higher education in Shenzhen is far from satisfactory. In all fairness, Shenzhen has worked hard in developing its system higher education. As of December 2021, Shenzhen has 15 local colleges and universities, among which the top ones are Shenzhen University or SZU (founded in 1983) and The Southern University of Science and Technology or SUSTech (founded in 2010). In “the Global Talent Competitiveness Index 2021 Report,” Shenzhen scores higher than its provincial capital city Guangzhou in “Major Universities” (4). Nevertheless, for Shenzhen, which is accustomed to being at the top in various economic rankings, its status in higher education falls below people’s expectations.
There are two main paths for Shenzhen to grow its higher education ecosystem: (1) independent development from green field (new) universities and (2) introducing prestigious universities:
Independent Development: Being the first local university in Shenzhen, SZU has become a prospective candidate to join the next version “Double First Class” list. SUSTech, established for just ten years, has grown even faster than SZU. Currently, SUSTech ranks ninth in mainland China in the THE ranking, its admission score is already at the upper-middle level among the “Double First Class” universities. What’s more, Shenzhen is planning to break ground on four more universities, i.e., Shenzhen Ocean University, Shenzhen Institute of Creative Design, Shenzhen Normal University and Shenzhen Conservatory of Music.
Introducing Prestigious Universities: Just as Shenzhen is able to attract top talent across the country, it is also attractive to top universities in China looking to set up campuses. The full-time undergraduate programs introduced into Shenzhen include: The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK-Shenzhen), Shenzhen MSU-BIT University, Sun Yat-sen University, Harbin Institute of Technology (HIT) and Jinan University. Name brand universities offering graduate schools in Shenzhen include the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Tsinghua University, Peking University, Wuhan University, Xiamen University, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Georgia Tech Shenzhen Institute of Tianjin University (GTSI), etc. The undergraduate tuition for the 2021-2022 academic year for CUHK-Shenzhen is 95,000 RMB (about US$15,000), ranking fourth in mainland China (5). Since 2019, HIT Shenzhen’s undergraduate admission scores have exceeded HIT’s main campus in Harbin.
The rapid growth of higher education in Shenzhen is inseparable from the full support from Shenzhen local government. Although the number of universities is significantly less than that of Beijing and Shanghai, Shenzhen’s budget for general higher education for 2020 was ￥18.17 billion, close to Beijing (￥19.8 billion ) and Shanghai (￥20.3 billion), the per-student financial appropriation standard for university students in Shenzhen is the highest in China (6). Comparing 2020 financial data of the top two universities in the four first-tier cities, SZU and SUSTech’s revenue mainly depend on government financial allocations, although the statistical caliber of funding for different universities varies.
Further than funding, having first-class scholars is more important for a university. In this regard, Shenzhen’s role model is the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), only 50 kilometers away. Founded in 1991, 8 years after SZU, HKUST is now an Asia’s top and internationally renowned research university; it ranked No.1 in THE Young University Rankings from 2018 to 2020. Chia-Wei Woo, the founding president of HKUST, was a consultant to SUSTech when it was founded. After Woo left the presidency of Cal State San Francisco and joined HKUST, he used his network to recruit a group of Chinese professors in North America for HKUST. It is obvious SUSTech also intended to follow suit.
According to the introduction on SUSTech’s official website, as of December 2021, SUSTech now has over 1300 faculty members on staff; 100% have PHD degrees; 90% have worked overseas; and 60% are from Top Universities around the world. Among SUSTech’s 27 academicians and chaired professors, 15 are from mainland China, 12 are from Hong Kong and overseas, 25 are Chinese and 2 are non-Chinese. Zhu Qingshi, the founding president of SUSTech (2009-2014), served as the President of the University of Science and Technology of China before, Zhu’s successor Chen Shiyi (2015-2020) and current president Xue Qikun (2020-current) has served as the vice president of Peking University and Tsinghua University respectively, this is why the majority of these domestic elite professors come from Beijing and the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
Building world-class institutions of higher education (much less an ecosystem) is hard work and it takes time. Thus, we believe, what we are observing now is just the tip of the iceberg of intellectual capital that is fueling China’s first Special Economic Zone. Looking back, we see some major disagreements on Shenzhen’s higher education ecosystem:
Reason –The two most cited reasons are to meet the needs of Shenzhen’s economic development and to satisfy the demands of Shenzhen residents for high-quality local universities. The latter is reasonable, while the former is specious. With world-class companies such as Huawei and Tencent, Shenzhen’s attractiveness to top talent is on par with other tier 1 cities. Having studied in Beijing or Hong Kong, then working in Shenzhen will not affect Shenzhen’s demand for talent. If having a well-known university was just a vanity project, this would likely be a wasted effort. However, given the tremendous investment from the local government, it seems clear that Shenzhen is focused on building a high-tech intellectual ecosystem on par with Silicon Valley.
Philosophy –The different views on how to run a university directly affected what was emerging. There is some cognitive dissonance between the local governments and the universities. Shenzhen has always hoped that the universities they funded would put local interest first, while the universities, especially universities introduced from outside Guangdong Province, don’t think that the localities understand education and they always put their brand and reputation first. A frequently asked question is: now that there is a prestigious university at our doorstep, is it easier for local students in Shenzhen to be admitted? When SUSTech was founded, it put its independence in a prominent position. As a result, SUSTech’s governance, enrollment methods are inconsistent with the requirements of the education authorities at different levels. The university is caught in the dilemma between walking away from traditional education system getting recognition by the authority of the system.
Methodology –Shenzhen’s economic development is known for its speed, but whether this works for education is questionable. To catch up the speed, many newly-founded universities in Shenzhen lacked adequate preliminary planning; the projects were launched hastily in pursuit of policy dividends and short-term benefits. SUSTech initially regarded HKUST model as the template of its scheme, but soon the cooperation between the two parties came to an end, the biggest disagreement was whether to design a comprehensive curriculum and form faculty before starting student enrollment. HKUST said yes, but SUSTech chose to "get on the bus first and then buy the ticket." Although SUSTech’s choice was often adopted in the early stages of Shenzhen, it was considered to have violated the spirit of rule of law and fairness after 30 years of reform and opening up, and was therefore rejected by the authority. In 2011, the first class of students refused to take the National College Entrance Examination (Gaokao高考) after being admitted by SUSTech in advance. As a result, their undergraduate degree was not recognized by the Ministry of Education when this cohort of students graduated 4 years later, and these students lost the opportunity to be a civil servant or work in state-owned enterprises.
Higher education is among the most highly regulated industries in China. Concerning about the gap between the eastern regions and other less-developed regions, Beijing has always been vigilant about universities setting new campus in another province. Ministry of Education (MOE) used the term "neither encourage nor support” in 2017 (7) and escalated to "strictly control the universities affiliated to MOE, and universities central and western Regions to carry out inter-provincial education in the eastern region" in 2021(8). In May 2020, MOE specifically called off Wuhan University's Shenzhen campus project determined in 2016. It looks like Shenzhen will not be able to introduce new undergraduate programs from Chinese universities outside of Guangdong or Hong Kong anymore.
From a broader perspective, what Shenzhen has experienced in developing its higher education has more or less occurred in other regions in China. The current layout of higher education in China was formed in the 1950s. The country was divided into six administrative regions, each has its own comprehensive universities, science and engineering universities, normal universities, agricultural colleges and medical colleges. When the old layout doesn't fit the new social and economic map, local governments in coastal areas lead a new round of university construction, because technology and talent always gather in places with good development momentum, high degree of civilization, and the most active place for innovation. However, bringing top scholars across the world to China is not only about benefits, but more importantly, is about good academic atmosphere. Now that China aspires to have world-class universities, it is not possible if there is no respect to academic freedom and university’s autonomy to conduct academic activities. From this perspective, SUSTech’s pursuit of independent education has tested Beijing's red line, i.e., local government can't change the basic system of higher education:
University governance must adhere to the leadership of the party - the “principal accountability under the leadership of the party committee”.Undergraduate admissions can't bypass Gaokao.
• University governance must adhere to the leadership of the party - the “principal accountability under the leadership of the party committee”.
• Undergraduate admissions can't bypass Gaokao.
Therefore, the reform logic of China’s governance is that the basic system can only be changed top down. Without breaking the basic system, local innovations are easier to succeed at the level of implementation mechanisms.
In general, through large-scale capital investment mostly from Shenzhen government, universities like SUSTech and SZU have reached first-class level in China, but they will be difficult to move up further, because now Shenzhen’s competitors have changed from Xi’an and Wuhan to Beijing and Shanghai. It is not realistic for Shenzhen to rely on its special zone identity to obtain exclusive policies for further breakthroughs in higher education. The purpose of Beijing to let Shenzhen pilot is to gain experience and further replicate the learnings in other parts of China, not just to maintain Shenzhen's unique status.
In 1955, William Shockley decided to leave Bell Labs and one year later, he started Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory in a farming valley 50 miles south of San Francisco where later becomes the famous Silicon Valley. In 1955, Stanford University, 70 years after its establishment, was far less famous than its neighbor UC Berkeley and CalTech. While Stanford University has contributed to the Silicon Valley, the Silicon Valley has made Stanford what it is today. If Shenzhen people know these details, they may be more patient. There is a Chinese proverb “it takes ten years to grow trees, but a hundred years to rear people” (十年树木, 百年树人). Building a good university requires not only funding, talent, and policies, but also time.
Also in 1955, Qian Xuesen (9), “Father of Chinese Rocketry,” was finally allowed to leave America and return China. Qian’s achievements stem from his education: undergraduate study from Jiao Tong University in Shanghai, Master and Doctor’s degree in MIT and CalTech. At the age of 94, Qian, China’s most influential scientist, made a remark to then Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao “Why are our schools always unable to cultivate outstanding talent” (为什么我们的学校总是培养不出杰出的人才), later being called “the Question of Qian Xuesen.” In many ways, the outcome of U.S.- China competition depends on the answer to Qian’s question.
