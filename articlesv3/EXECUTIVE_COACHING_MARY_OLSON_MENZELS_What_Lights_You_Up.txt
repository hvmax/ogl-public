AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide analyses about leadership in the global economy. We work to bring research and analyses to our readers, students, and clients, helping them understand this complex moment in this moment in China’s economic development trajectory. As part of this goal, OGL Chairman Doug Guthrie, together with the Thunderbird Foreign Policy Initiative launched the Leadership and Innovation Series. The series invited Mary Olson-Menzel to discuss her recently releasedUSA Today-bestselling book “What Lights You Up: Illuminate Your Path and Take the Next Big Step in Your Career. Guthrie, Fondrevay, and Olson-Menzel are all members of the 100 Coaches Group, which brings together top-level executive coaches from around the world.
I believe that organizations like the 100 Coaches Agency, founded by Marshall Goldsmith and Scott Osman, and the Thunderbird School of Global Management are changing the way that leadership education and executive coaching are evolving in fundamental ways, in ways that are great for the rising leaders in the global political economy.
To better understand this phenomena, Thunderbird recently hosted Mary Olson-Menzel for a discussion about her USA Today-bestselling book “What Lights You Up: Illuminate Your Path and Take the Next Big Step in Your Career. Olson-Menzel was in conversation with me and Jennifer Fondrevay, a rockstar executive coach and Thunderbird alum.
I have always been a China scholar. In business school world, you can’t just be an area studies person (“China guy”), you have to fit into some functional area of expertise. In my early years at New York University's Stern School of Business, I was put into the Management Department. Initially, the thinking was that I would be a strategy guy. Even at that young age, I had helped several foreign companies think about how to navigate the Chinese economic landscape. However, I found what I really loved to teach about was leadership – helping leaders think strategically but also build strong and effective teams and organizations.
I then built my career around that passion. I ran NYU’s Executive Education business, oversaw the Berlin School of Creative Leadership, even became a dean of a business school for a short time. Then, when my academic administrative career ended suddenly, I went to work for Apple's Tim Cook and Joel Podolny. I was tapped to run Apple University in China, and I was doing my two favorite things: teaching leadership development and advising senior leaders on how to navigate China in the tense political world of President Xi Jinping.
When I returned to the U.S., and returned to academia, I was invited by Marshall Goldsmith to join the exclusive 100 Coaches Group. I remember the initial conversation with Marshall:
Doug: “Marshall, I am not sure if you have the right person… I have never been an Executive Coach.”
Marshall: “Doug, the word on the street is that you coached Tim Cook and the Apple Executive Team on how to navigate China under Xi Jinping… I think your credentials are fine… Do you want to join us or not?”
Doug: “I’d be honored.”
So, there I was, hanging out on weekly calls with the top 100 executive coaches in the world. And it was there that I met Jennifer Fondrevay and Mary Olson-Menzel, two dear friends, and two powerhouses in the field of executive coaching.
Through 100 Coaches, the three of us became friends and collaborators. When Mary’s wonderful book was scheduled to come out, Jennifer and I arranged to give a book talk at Thunderbird. She gave her book talk on October 17, 2024, and Mary and Jennifer were amazing. Our standing-room-only audience learned so much that day.
