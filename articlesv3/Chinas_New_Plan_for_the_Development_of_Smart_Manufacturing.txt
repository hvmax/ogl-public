### China’s New Plan for the Development of Smart Manufacturing

AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy and, in particular, life in China. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. We have written a series about the strategic strength oflocal economic development in China’s 2nd and 3rd tier citiesandentrepreneurship in China today. We have also written about the ways in which local officials have engaged in careful development ofChina’s powerful manufacturing economy(see alsohere,here, andhere). This post adds to that conversation.

Recently, China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT), the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) and another eight ministries jointly issued the “14th Five Year Plan” (14FYP) for the development of smart (intelligent) manufacturing. The plan defined the guiding concepts, basic principles, development paths, development objectives, key tasks, and safeguard measures for the development of Intelligent Manufacturing in China for the next five years and onward. A close reading of the documents embedded in China’s Five-Year Plan might seem a wonky subject for people who aren't close China watchers, but there are important implications here for China and corporations doing business in China in the years to come.
First, the plan is a continuation of "Made in China 2025". China is intent upon building a consumption-based economy (through theDouble Circulation Economy Plan), yet it has no plans to transition away from manufacturing. There is much discussion of Smart Manufacturing in both "Made in China 2025" and in the 14FYP.
Second, as is evident from moves that have been made to rein in China’s Big Tech economy, the government is clearly worried about the balance between the “real” economy and the “platform” economy. The Plan calls for a redirection of focus and resources in the core economy through a deeper investment in and development of smart manufacturing. The fear is that a shift in focus and resources to the platform economy will lead to a hollowing out of the manufacturing economy.
Third, by observing the industrial evolution in the United Kingdom, Japan, the United States, and Germany, China has decided to keep all industry 1.0 and 2.0 at home while continuing to develop industry 3.0 and 4.0. The government sees the digitization of the industries and the industrialized digital industry as a way to move forward and an engine for growth.
The content of the Plan can be summarized as “two steps, four major tasks, and six actions.” There are also measures laid out for cross-function coordination, finance support, a public platform to link the needs in services, and international corporations.
In the Plan, by 2025, most manufacturing enterprises “above scale”(1) will achieve digitization and networking, and enterprises in key industries will initially apply intellectualization. By 2035, all manufacturing enterprises above scale will be fully equipped with digital networking, and backbone enterprises in key industries will basically be realized in intellectualization.
Four Major Tasks
Four Major Tasks were outlined in the Plan:
First, accelerate system innovation and enhance new momentum of integrated development;
Second, deepen promotion and application, and explore new paths of transformation and upgrading;
Third, strengthen the indigenous supply and expand industrial systems to a new advantage; and
Fourth, consolidate the foundation support and build a new safeguard for smart manufacturing.
Six Actions were charted in the 15-page document with specific contents, paths and goals:
Smart manufacturing technology breakthrough actionIntelligent manufacturing demonstration sites actionIndustry intelligent transformation and upgrading actionIntelligent manufacturing equipment innovation and development actionIndustrial software breakthrough and improvement actionSmart manufacturing standards pilot action
• Smart manufacturing technology breakthrough action
• Intelligent manufacturing demonstration sites action
• Industry intelligent transformation and upgrading action
• Intelligent manufacturing equipment innovation and development action
• Industrial software breakthrough and improvement action
• Smart manufacturing standards pilot action
This Plan has important policies and practical significance. First, the Plan is the implementation detail of the 14FYP for national economic and social development of China and it outlines the long-term objectives through 2035. In the national 14FYP, the development of smart manufacturing related industries is highlighted, and the plan released this time is the execution plan in this key field, which cascades down to all fields and regions to formulate more detailed blue prints and differentiated focuses according to their own conditions.
Second, instead of the digital and intelligent platforms that were hit last fall by policies, the state is now giving full attention and support to the development of digital intelligence in the manufacturing industry. The Plan aims to strengthen the intelligent level of China's manufacturing industry, promote the integration of manufacturing industry and digital intelligence technology through pilot demonstrations, cultivate system solution providers, and positioning in standards creation.
Third, the Plan tracks with the global trend of technological development and industrial transformation and upgrading. The wave of digital transformation has brought a great impact on the traditional manufacturing. Digital industrialization has spawned a series of digital related industries and formed a new industrial system with good market potential. The integration of artificial intelligence and other digital technologies in the manufacturing has accelerated, and the barriers between digital technologies and industries have been continuously broken through. Yet the new business forms and models have put forward higher requirements for the relevant systems and supporting policies, to which the governance modernization is the only way.
The Implications for Business
What will this mean for business? We believe the plan will likely have these effects:
1. China refocuses digital technology and artificial intelligence in the “real” economy
2. Industry transformation and upgrading from Industry 2.0 to Industry 3.0 and 4.0
3. Access to 5G connection, network hardware and software, and AI in manufacturing sectors
4. Need of electrical engineering and computer science (EECS) talent
5. High-end Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machinery will be key
6. China will be aggressive in the standards setting and fighting for a say in the global industrial political economy
Note 1: “above scale” is a statistic term generally means an entity’s revenue >RMB 20 mil (~USD3 mil).
