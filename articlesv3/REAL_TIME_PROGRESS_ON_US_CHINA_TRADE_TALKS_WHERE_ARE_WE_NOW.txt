### REAL TIME: PROGRESS ON US-CHINA TRADE TALKS… WHERE ARE WE NOW?

On Saturday May 10, 2025, in Geneva, Switzerland, Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng met with US Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent, and US Trade Representative, Jamieson Greer. We have written and spoken about the current “trade war” dynamics in a number of previous posts (see, e.g.,here,here,here,here, andhere). Since President Trump’s launch of the tariffs on April 10, the tariff/trade war has escalated to Chinese tariffs on the US of 125% and Chinese tariffs on the US of 145%. The May 10 Geneva meeting was the first formal meeting between the world’s two largest economies since President Trump announced tariffs on China in January of 2025. This is an important step forward, as our countries seek to avoid and Economic Cold War. In this post, we analyze the perceptions of these issues from both the US and China sides of the equation.
This is a tense time in US-China relations. President Trump made good on his promise of aggressively tariffing the world, launching tariffs on many (virtually all) global trading partners, including Canada, Mexico, the EU, and, most importantly for our OGL research, China.
The U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods have escalated to hysterical levels (145% at one point), and China reciprocated with 125% tariffs on US imported goods. In the world’s current global political economy, this is an unsustainable process that challenges decades of economic theory and practice, undermines global manufacturing supply chains, and depresses the global economy.
We have written about these issues in a variety of political posts. Are Trump, Vice President Vance, and Peter Navarro simply ignorant of how tariffs work? The success of raising prices at the border through tariffs to incentivize American consumers to “buy American-made goods” only works if there is a manufacturing supply chain here. Unfortunately, there is not, whether you’re talking iPhones, toys or furniture. Where are we going with this trade war? The primary target is the world’s second largest economy and the United States’ most important manufacturing supplier, and the ill effects of this have already taken a toll and will be felt around the world if they continue unabated.
So, where are we right now? To quote President Trump from his Truth Social site: “A very good meeting [on May 10th] with China, in Switzerland. Many things discussed, much agreed to. A total reset negotiated in a friendly, but constructive, manner. We want to see for the good of both China and the U.S., an opening up of China to American business. GREAT PROGRESS MADE!!!”
Big questions about whether there was indeed “GREAT PROGRESS MADE!!!,” as the entire process feels like a bit of a ruse right now. But certainly, things are changing. Economist Paul Krugman just published “When an Arsonist Poses as a Firefighter: Tariffs, What the Hell Just Happened?”
So, whether “GREAT PROGRESS WAS MADE” or whether this is just an “arsonist posing as a firefighter,” this is a debate we can have. And what the crazy shenanigans mean for the citizens of the two largest economies is open for discussion. So, let’s dive into the OGL views on this critical, important issue…
How are US citizens perceiving and experiencing the growing economic tensions between our two nations?
Unfortunately, we believe the US citizenry has been a little slow to grasp what is happening with the US economy. The idea that Peter Navarro, co-author of the incendiary book, Death By China: Confronting the Dragon – Death By China, is a ridiculous and obvious illustration of the ways in which the Trump Administration is attempting to fuel a trade-war fire. However, our OGL analysis is that a significant portion of America is still unclear about the lies they are being fed. For the most part, it seems that the majority of Americans still believe that tariffs will increase prices, thus inducing manufacturing supply chains, for goods ranging from toys to garments to iPhones, to return to the United States. The fact that US capital markets are bouncing around significantly based on the rapid changes in the tariff and trade markets shows that there is much uncertainty in what the Trump Administration is attempting to achieve in this new administration.
How are Chinese citizens perceiving and experiencing the growing economic tensions between our two nations?
Following the China-U.S. talks in Geneva, the two nations issued a joint statement announcing reciprocal tariff reductions and scaled-back countermeasures. Main viewpoints on Chinese social media regarding this development include:
Beyond expectations - As Chinese state media had lowered expectations ahead of the talks, emphasizing a "dialogue" rather than "negotiation," the May 12 joint statement exceeded even the most optimistic predictions. As China is the only country to retaliate against Trump's tariff measures while other countries remain restrained, Beijing's tough stance is seen as a success and a sign of strength. Many media predict that other countries will take a tougher stance in trade talks with the Trump administration.Who blinked first - Before the Geneva talks, media speculated whether China or the U.S. would "blink first." While Washington claimed the trade deficit party "holds more cards," the outcome suggests the U.S. made bigger concessions. We believe this result benefits both nations. After a month of intense confrontation, rationality ultimately prevailed. China and the U.S., as the world's two largest economies, present a nuanced economic landscape: the U.S. leads in nominal GDP, while China surpassed it in GDP measured by purchasing power parity (PPP) over a decade ago. The interdependent economic relationship between the two remains crucial to the well-being of both nations. China has consistently emphasized that a prolonged trade war between the two countries benefits no one and that it does not seek conflict with the U.S. While challenging negotiations lie ahead for both governments, it is premature to label either party as a “loser” of the Geneva agreement. That said, those who initiated Trump's global tariff war have undoubtedly emerged as clear losers.Stay alert - Scholars view the current outcome as a "temporary détente," with the U.S. and China still on a downward trajectory of economic and trade decoupling. Upcoming negotiations will face significant challenges, including economic structure differences, non-tariff barriers, and fentanyl-related tariffs. Given the Trump's history of abrupt reversals and eroded credibility, some warn that Washington may resume pressure under new pretexts. China must therefore guard against U.S. backtracking, leverage tools like its holdings of U.S. Treasury bonds, and avoid excessive leniency.Protracted Competition - Most Chinese netizens recognize that the Sino-US rivalry is a marathon, not a sprint. Although China's 90-day tariff truce agreement signifies an initial success in the trade conflict, the country remains the weaker party in comprehensive national strength. China's journey to surpass the US will undoubtedly be arduous and protracted.

Overall, the prevailing narrative across Chinese social media can be summarized into three key themes: supporting the government, acknowledging the outcome, and remaining vigilant.
Part of the question of who is going to “blink” first has to do with the personalities of the leaders. Chairman Xi is a proud leader, and it seems unlikely that he will allow China to be seen as bowing down to the United States. How are people in China viewing Chairman Xi’s leadership in this moment?
Chinese netizens generally express support and understanding regarding Beijing's response to Trump's tariff escalation, primarily in the following areas:
Support for firm countermeasures: Most netizens see Trump's initiation of a new trade war as "economic coercion" and "political theatrics," arguing that China must retaliate against his bullying tactics.
Acknowledging the government's strategic steadfastness: Netizens praised the government for its composure and determination in handling Trump's unpredictable policies while maintaining its own pace. Amid Washington's erratic shifts, public sentiment largely endorses Beijing's prudent stance, cautioning against lowering China's guard due to transient conciliatory rhetoric from the U.S.
Concern about economic impact: Discussions focus on tariff-induced pressures on export-oriented enterprises and supply chains, especially in U.S.-dependent sectors like electronics and textiles. Calls arise for targeted relief measures, such as financial aids and subsidies, to protect vulnerable industries from trade war effects. Many middle-class employees of foreign companies in China are growing pessimistic about the future, fearing the ongoing trade war could threaten their jobs. They believe foreign firms generally comply better with regulations like social insurance and working hours. Currently, domestic companies, caught in intense internal competition, cannot fully replace the positive role foreign enterprises play in China's employment and consumption.
Proud of China's International Influence: Netizens note that China's firm countermeasures have created a demonstration effect, boosting confidence in resisting the Trump tariffs. Top leader's diplomatic efforts, including visits to Vietnam, Malaysia, and Cambodia in April and a phone call with the French President in May, convey China's commitment to upholding international trade rules.
How is China adapting its existing manufacturing supply chain to form new partnerships and national alliances in response to the trade war?
We have written about China’s manufacturing supply chain being the most advanced and sophisticated in the world. Of course, the trade war is going to hurt the economy that is built around this supply chain. However, where in the case of the United States, following President Trump’s logic, a domestic manufacturing supply chain must be built from scratch. In China’s case, the supply chain is there, and the requirement now is a pivot to partnerships with new “customers” or new national partners.
Should the two governments fail to reach a substantive agreement within the next 90 days, we estimate there will be negative impacts on the industries of both countries in the following ways.
Impacts on China:
Short-term (within 1 year): Export-reliant sectors, particularly consumer electronics, photovoltaics, and textiles, would face severe disruptions such as declining orders, rising inventory, liquidity shortages, and overcapacity issues. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) may experience mass closures, resulting in layoffs, wage cuts, and increased unemployment pressures.Medium-term (1-3 years): Accelerated offshore production relocation could disrupt supply chains. Although Chinese firms may expedite diversification into new markets, such efforts face significant challenges, including long implementation cycles and delayed returns due to trade barriers and geopolitical risks.

Impacts on U.S.:
Short-term (within 1 year): The U.S. retail industry has borne the brunt of the impact, facing product shortages and price increases, which raise consumer costs and intensify living pressures. Importers and retailers are experiencing severely squeezed profit margins and rising operational risks, with some businesses at risk of bankruptcy. Large enterprises dependent on Chinese supply chains, such as those in automotive and electronics manufacturing, are facing production halts and rising costs due to disruptions in critical component supplies caused by both Trump tariffs and China's non-tariff measures. Meanwhile, restricted U.S. agricultural exports to China are harming the farming sector, potentially undermining the interests of traditional MAGA supporters and may affect the outcomes of the upcoming Congressional midterm elections. supporters and influence the outcomes of the upcoming Congressional midterm elections.Medium-term (1-3 years): Without China's support, the U.S. manufacturing reshoring initiative would be unlikely to succeed. Domestically, the U.S. will face persistent high inflation, slow economic growth, and an increasing risk of recession.

A prolonged Sino-American stalemate would accelerate the reconfiguration of global supply chains. Washington's push to relocate critical industries from China to the U.S., which has low short-term feasibility, is already increasing costs and reducing efficiency for multinational corporations.
Meanwhile, China is deepening regional cooperation through the Belt and Road Initiative and RCEP to reduce reliance on the U.S., while strictly controlling the outflow of core technologies. If the deadlock persists, both countries risk entering a lose-lose dynamic: global trade volumes would decline sharply, and decoupling pressures would destabilize the global economy.
