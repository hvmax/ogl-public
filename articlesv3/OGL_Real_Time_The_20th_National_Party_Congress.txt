On Global Leadership's feature, OGL Real Time, presents our up-to-the-minute insights on current news and events. We hope these breaking news insights from our OGL team members will help illuminate the events of the day and provide the depth needed to understand global political, economic and cultural transitions and transformations. This Real Time Q&A post seeks to present a nuanced picture of some of the key behind-the-scenes dynamics leading up to the 20th National Party Congress, which will take place on October 16, 2022.
In the lead up to the 20th National Party Congress, there has been a lot of speculation about President Xi Jinping’s third term. What can we say about the process of extending his tenure?
OGL: We believe the party has already reached consensus on Xi’s third term so it’s not really a topic for the 20th Congress. The following table summarizes the important events and public statements drumming up support for Xi's re-election, and we can see that the third term is already a matter of course. Currently, Xi holds three key positions: General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, Chairman of the Central Military Commission, and President of China.
The topic of Xi's third term is  rarely discussed among ordinary people, which could be for a number of reasons including:
1. It is a very sensitive topic and quite far from the daily lives of normal citizens.
2. Although there are dissatisfactions of one kind or another, in general, people accept the performance of CPC.
The U.S. crackdown on China is considered an important reason why China is facing so many difficulties. So far, China's performance in the U.S.-China trade war has been better than most people expected.Although strict COVID-prevention measures have affected the lives of many people, and industries such as aviation and tourism have been seriously affected, the social order in China has generally remained normal. While the life of ordinary people is not easy, but it has not reached the point that life cannot be carried on.

3. Comparatively, Xi was born in 1953—younger than some major leaders in the world like U.S. President Biden (1942), Russian President Putin (1952) and Indian Prime Minister Modi (1950).
What does this mean for the future of the Party?
OGL: We have several thoughts about that:
1. In the short term, Xi's third term would ensure the continuity and certainty of China's policies. At the same time, higher expectations are put forward for the party and Xi, in particular:
How to further develop the economy and improve people's livelihood.While maintaining the environment of China's peaceful development, how to safeguard China’s national interests and protect China’s dignity, so as not to appear soft to the outside world (2).
• How to further develop the economy and improve people's livelihood.
• While maintaining the environment of China's peaceful development, how to safeguard China’s national interests and protect China’s dignity, so as not to appear soft to the outside world (2).
2. In the long run, the postponement of China’s next generation of leaders does not represent a solution to the issue. The key is how will the CPC establish a succession mechanism and institutionalize the leadership system.
Can you give us a sense of the priorities the Party will be pursuing in the wake of the Party Congress?
OGL: The general background of the 20th Congress is that China has built a moderately prosperous society and is marching toward its 2nd Centenary (1949-2049) Goals to develop China into a modernized socialistic country and achieve the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. At the Congress, CPC will lay out goals, tasks, and major policies for the party and the country in the next five years and beyond. Economic development will remain the most important task for CPC (others may think ideology overtakes the economy), and  addressing the imbalance and inadequacy of development is the priority. We expect the party will make major efforts on overcoming shortfalls and weaknesses as an important improvement.
What do you expect from President Xi's third term?
OGL: Maintaining a position for China to be able to have both peace and development.
What are your predictions for what the Party Congress will mean for China’s economic performance and China’s role in the global political economy?
OGL: The party congress is the event that has the greatest impact on China's political economy today. Here are some of the areas of interest for the 20th Congress:
1. Standing committee members. Who will be the new members and will the current seven-person standing committee be enlarged up to nine? The arrangement is a signal as to how the CPC will establish a succession mechanism and who will be in the key leadership positions of China for the next five years.
2. Report to the 20th National Congress of CPC by President Xi is the most important document of the Congress, and we'll be tracking:
Will the expression, "China is still in an important period of strategic opportunity for development", continue to be used for this complex environment?Will there be further clarification on the overall risks that may delay or interrupt the process of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation?Are there any new statements on economic development, deepening reform and opening up, developing democracy and the rule of law, social development, national security, etc.Is there any new framework regarding national reunification?

Some 2,300 party delegates will gather in Beijing on Oct. 16 to select a new central committee, which consists of about 200 members. Those members will then determine the members of the Politburo (25 members) and its seven-member standing committee, the highest leadership circle.

2. Refers to the angry reaction of the mainland people after U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan in August 2022. The last time people showed such a flood of anger was when the U.S. bombed the Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia in 1999.
