We hope these breaking news insights from our OGL team members will help illuminate the events of the day and provide the depth needed to understand global political, economic and cultural transitions and transformations. This post follows up on the difficult decisions that the Chinese Government has made around issues relating to the regulation of China’s Big Tech Industry, especially surrounding education.
By Dashiell Chien, Chris Gao, and Diane Long
1. What is happening with China’s regulation of the education-technology sector in China today?
On July 24, 2021, the CPC and State Council announced its  “double reduction” policy (双减) to reduce primary and secondary school students’ workload and reduce after school subject training pressures.  Immediately, the EdTech stocks listed in Hong Kong and New York plummeted, some down as much as 50%. Overseas investors committed to a massive sell-off in panic. People could not imagine a government would smash one of its own industries, with the flip of a wrist.
To understand this heated issue, it's critical to understand the premises and the fundamentals behind these decisions. What is President Xi’s “New Era”, the nation’s new ideology and direction for growth?
The recent measures came out the CPC’s Central Committee, which issued a top-down reform order on education and tutoring institutions (教培产业). In practice, the central government took charge of educational adjustments while the Ministry of Education implemented the policies. Therefore, one must view this education direction as a political issue rather than an administrative affair.
This “reduction” of students’ workload started in 2018. Since then, almost every couple of months there had been further discussions and guidelines coming out. And even before the final showdown on July 24, there was a reform meeting, held by Xi on May 21, 2021, that covered the specifics that came out two months later. If investors had been paying attention, they could have seen this announcement coming and could have escaped the financial loss.
The same disciplinary exercise has happened with the real estate market for years, and more recently the FinTech sector (such as Ant Finance and others). The economic, social and industry policies in recent years were aligned with new narratives about Chinese ethics and values, as well as top-level designs and underlying logic--the gauge of how well the party and the Chinese government are coping with domestic and external challenges.
Back to the online and off-line tutoring industry. It addresses how to manage the education system, and what should the education outcome be. Chinese leaders have their own answers from a top-level design. Beyond the school learning process, education is considered the core if not the highest position in Chinese society.
1. Education is supposed to help maintain social stability and promote common prosperity. But can it create more equality of opportunity? That is to say, is access to a good education dependent on a family’s income or not? The college entrance examination may be fair to everyone, but higher-income families tend to buy after-school courses and have an additional apartment to access a good school district. Thus, financial ability plays a crucial role in enhancing social mobility and having more chances than those who don’t have financial means.
2. What kind of education does the party want the next generation to receive? A well-rounded education (and good physical health) or endless problem-solving sets and memorization prepping for ‘gaokao’ (高考), the college entrance exam.
3. The party particularly cares about what type of education future social elites (politicians, entrepreneurs, executives, professionals, and overseas educated talents) receive and their sense of allegiance to the party. It's important they have a correct understanding of the country.
4. The best way to allocate resources is for public schools to carry more of the responsibility for providing a balanced, free, and quality education. The technology should support rural schools by streaming top teachers' lectures, making scarce resources available broadly to students and teachers in training.
EdTech platforms by nature are chasing user memberships for leveraging and capitalization. It creates societal anxiety and FOMO, leaving parents with no choice. Among the parents with school children, the hottest terms in the recent years are “involution” (内卷) and “rooster kids” (鸡娃). The first describes the fierce competition among K-12 students and the unhealthy use of excessive problem-solving and memorization. The later has a history. In the 1960s, there was a treatment of rooster blood injection to activate patients. Now, the phrase is used to describe the group of parents who are forcing kids into after-school studies and tutoring, and their children are considered “rooster kids”.
The EdTech expansion violates the following values of the party’s vision for China:
1) Education and profiteering. To what extent did the party let capital strong-arm education? The platform economy is about user traffic. Promoting content to active users creates a fear of missing out (FOMO), parental anxiety, vicious competition, etc. Also, it comes with false ads and misleading promises. The central government plans to detach education from financial institutions to prevent the disorderly expansion of the tutoring industry. Consequently, the new guidelines said tutoring institutions are not allowed to raise funds from overseas, putting a halt to overseas listing.
2) Education and real estate.The party has pledged to rein in speculations on housing prices in school districts. In China,  educational resources belong to local governments and are distributed based on local housing property and hukou (residence status). It is inevitable that superior school resources motivate people to chase property in respected school districts, which drives up housing prices. Apparently, Beijing has decided to form a swapping system requiring school principals and seasoned teachers to rotate from school to school every five to six years. The hope is to level the reputation of all schools.
3) Education and birth rate. Steady increases in China's birth rate has become a core issue in the national strategy. But the mounting pressure of education costs is an obstacle for having multiple children. The party wants to stimulate births by controlling unnecessary anxiety driven by the cost of educating and tutoring children.
4) Education and consumption. Expansion of the tutoring industry is bound to limit the household appetite for other consumption areas, thus defeating the domestic circulation strategy.
Education is about politics, and there obviously is high-level consideration in terms of logic and ideas behind the regulation. Enterprises and players that come into the market need to understand the underlying logic here. It’s a paradigm shift that  parents, students, schools, and training companies all need to absorb. In general, people think if the examining system is not changed, the “gaokao” is not changed, then the path forward will not be changed.
There could be some unintended consequences that redirect this effort at social change. The training activities could go underground, becoming less transparent and more expensive. The development of remote education technology would likely be held up.
The best option for investing in China right now? Find the growth fields in the direction of the nation’s ideology, along with the Chinese social values, and the new development pattern that was laid out in CPC’s 14FYP and 2035 Guidelines.
2. As the on-the-ground OGL China team, what do you  think is actually going on with the regulation of big tech firms in China today? What does the Chinese Government want to achieve in regulating issues ranging from gaming to music streaming?
The recent intense rectification of the technology sectors in China has gone beyond the imagination of most people. A series of measures taken by Chinese authorities mark the end of the era of loose supervision of Internet technology companies for the past 20 years.
The status and resources achieved by Chinese Internet giants such as Alibaba and Tencent, also brings with it intense regulatory pressure. In the past two decades, Chinese Internet technology companies have experienced a rare era of freedom mainly for two reasons:
First, the Chinese government wanted to encourage new industries represented by Internet technology;Second, the Internet technology sector is developing so fast that the government is unable to formulate supervisory mechanisms in a timely manner.
• First, the Chinese government wanted to encourage new industries represented by Internet technology;
• Second, the Internet technology sector is developing so fast that the government is unable to formulate supervisory mechanisms in a timely manner.
From the history of Chinese Internet giants, one finds that almost all of them had original sins such as plagiarism, piracy, and infringement in their early days. After growing up, they have also been involved in issues such as monopoly, breach of data privacy, and use of algorithms to oppress workers at the bottom, etc. Driven by capital, these Chinese internet companies, which believe in the law of the jungle and winner take all, have taken  advantage of loopholes in supervision and have grown brutally as a result. Not only have they defeated Chinese domestic off-line opponents, one after another, but also American internet giants like Amazon and Uber in China as well.
Chinese netizens have long lamented that while the U.S. tech giants are investing in artificial intelligence, biomedicine, and other hard core technologies, their Chinese counterparts were busy coming up with clever models that address ordinary people’s wallets and aim at suckers who will pay. Beijing believes that "hard technologies" is the key to the competition between countries.
If China needs to be more autonomous in areas like semiconductors, more resources and talent must be invested in the "hard technology." These days, many young people in China find that learning a skill is not necessary for their survival in big cities. Young migrant workers would rather choose to deliver packages generated by Internet platforms than work on an assembly line at factories. One purpose of this enhanced regulation on platform-based internet companies is to turn around the mass pursuit of short-term wealth and guide young people to join "hard technology" companies that require patience and a longer-term commitment.
Strengthening tech company supervision is a global trend. For a long time, global regulators have been more talk than action. China is trying to tame these technology monsters, essentially using administrative power to promote social change, with the goal of creating an equitable environment for the entire society. Many people have doubts about whether Beijing can maintain the market vitality and corporate competitiveness of the Internet industry while strengthening regulation. Different regulatory bodies having different regulatory requirements, which has confused many companies and caused a lot of anxiety and uneasiness, and dampened the enthusiasm of the investors, especially overseas investors. Driving social change is a gamble. Whether the Chinese authorities themselves can keep to the rules, respect the market, and regulate by law will determine the success of this approach.
