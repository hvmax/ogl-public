### Year of the Tiger: OGL Observations on China for 2022

13 January 2022|China, China politics, Economic Development, Geopolitics
AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy and, in particular, life in China. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. We have sought to advance a conversation about the U.S.-China relationship, and a deep understanding of local economic development in China. In this post, we reflect on the year that has been and the issues we need to keep an eye on in 2022. – The Editorial Team
By The On Global Leadership
People have always looked to clairvoyants to predict the future, and today's sage thought leaders have responded to that need with predictions for everything from current events to sports. On Global Leadership has enjoyed reading the assessments of our friends Scott Galloway, Kara Swisher and SupChina, a China-focused platform, but we don't see ourselves as being in the business ofpredictingthe future.
Because we concentrate on deep, nuanced analysis of events as they unfold, we would like to offer instead a series of areas to watch in the Year of the Tiger. (We will attach probabilities to our areas to watch to put more meat on the bone.) In releasing these observations now, we are anticipating China’s Lunar Calendar, which begins February 1, 2022, and not the western calendar. Accordingly, we are timing our areas to watch to reflect the beginning of China's calendar of annual events and activities.
China Politics & the 20th National Party Congress
Will President Xi continue to serve as general secretary? This is something to watch in the run up to the 20th National Party Congress, the quinquennial political gathering scheduled for the fall 2022, but it is going to be the case (100%). How the Party aligns around his re-appointment, however, will be important. This will be largely tied to the economy and, in particular, GDP growth. Xi has been given a lot of latitude in some of his hardline policies because economic growth has continued under his reign. If his aggressive positions begin to harm the economy, a turn could happen quickly.Will Li Keqiang continue to stay as a Politburo Standing Committee member? (50%) Going back a few decades, age did not seem to be so much of a consideration. At the 15th Central Committee of the CPC in 1997, the top three out of seven Politburo Standing Committee members were over 68: Jiang Zeming (71), Li Peng (69), and Zhu Rongji (69). Since 2002, there has been an unwritten rule (a norm) on the term of office of Politburo members. If you're 67, you stay; if you're 68, you retire. The rule was partially broken by Wang Qishan’s vice presidency at the age of 69, but without a position in the Party. Current members under the age of 68 are: Li Keqiang (67), Wang Yang (67), Wang Huning (67), and Zhao Leji (65). It will be interesting to see if this norm will hold in the coming year.Finally, among new Politburo members who has the potential to be part of the next core team? Years ago, it was widely assumed that Chen Minger was the heir-apparent to  Xi. While it seems that Chen has been sidelined, the question remains of what a Xi succession plan will eventually look like. (50%)

Infrastructure projects will be accelerated in Q1. (100%) As we have written previously, China has orchestrated a complex balance transitioning between investment-led and consumption-led growth. However, the dynamics of COVID-19 have shifted the calculus of economic development, including the development of theDouble Circulation Economy. Moving from investment-led to consumption-led growth is difficult, which is the reason economists have analyzed and written about what they call the “middle-income trap” for developing nations. COVID-19 will require that China continue to grow the economy through more investment in infrastructure – and there is still work to be done building China's infrastructure.Can China's foreign trade maintain double-digit growth? (Note: 2021 Jan. – Nov: export 21.8%, import 22.2%) We believe the answer to this one is yes. (100%) First, China is the largest market in the world. Two of the most valuable companies in the world right now, Apple and Tesla, have China ass their second-largest markets, behind the United States. Both of these companies do billions of dollars in business in China. Imports will continue, especially as China builds a larger middle class. On the export side, China will not be challenged here. China’s manufacturing supply chain is unrivaled. There are many reasons for this, which we have written about and discussed elsewhere: the floating population, the integration of the supply chain through infrastructure, and the thoughtful construction of industrial clusters. There is no country-in-the-waiting that is going to take China’s position as exporter to the world.Will China’s property tax pilot carry on as planned? (70%) Despite all of the questions that have been raised about Evergrande, China’s tax pilot is an important policy in the making (GL has written about thishere). We believe that the pilot will continue and will continue to evolve.The real estate financial crisis,but the central government will control it to the level of causing great pain for the private investors.Inequality will continue to grow – 600 million low-income workers won't have much improvement due to the supply-chain shocks that will reduce low-level manufacturing jobs. (50%)China will work on improving productivity by implementing 5G connections and smart manufacturing. (75%)

Will China give up 'Dynamic zero-COVID' policy and change to "living with the virus"? (Note: The gist of “Dynamic zero-COVID” is to cut off the spread of new infections as soon as possible, instead of just letting go of the situation and allowing it to run out of control.) We believe this has a low probably (Perhaps 5%). It is clear that the Xi administration has bolstered its position through its management of COVID-19. Whether you believe the statistics or not, it is clear that China’s handling of the virus has saved lived by orders of magnitude compared to the United States (6,000 deaths versus 700,000 deaths). The wildcard here will be the Beijing Olympics. How Beijing chooses to handle the zero-COVID policy when thousands of athletes are entering the country is a script to be written.Will China relax border management for COVID-19 prevention? (0% for Q1, 30% for Q4).

U.S.-China relationship
When will President Biden lower the Trump tariffs? We have to admit we are at a loss in this area. When Biden was inaugurated, we assumed there would be a transition from antagonism toward engagement. But Biden advisor Kurt Campbell shortly thereafter announced the end of the engagement era and the beginning ofthe era of competition. As we have discussed previously, this is a sad turn of events. As to whether it will continue, it's looks that way for now. (90%)

Cross-strait relations
Will the situation across the Taiwan Strait get worse? There will be a lot of noise, but probably no real action. (85%)China and Russia will get closer in sharing resources and technologies to fight the pressure from the West. (70%)There will likely be a scuffle or standoff event in the South China Seas, but not in Taiwan Strait, as this could too easily spiral out of control. (75%)
