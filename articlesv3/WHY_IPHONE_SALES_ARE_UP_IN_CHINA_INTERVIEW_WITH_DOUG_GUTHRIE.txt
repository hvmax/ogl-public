### WHY IPHONE SALES ARE UP IN CHINA: INTERVIEW WITH DOUG GUTHRIE

On Global Leadership’s regular feature OGL Real Time presents our up-to-the-minute insights on current news and events. We hope these breaking news insights from our OGL team members will help illuminate the events of the day and provide the depth needed to understand global political, economic, and cultural transitions and transformations. In this post, we link to a recent interview with Straight Arrow News reporter Simone Del Rosario.
The Straight Arrow News interview with OGL's Doug Guthrie begins with questions about why Apple iPhone sales have suddenly jumped in China and then explores larger trade issues related to China’s manufacturing supply chain and China-India relations.
Guthrie surmises that iPhone sales are likely up because Apple continues to rely on and develop its close ties with the Chinese Government. He further notes that the recent resolution of the China-India border dispute suggests that the future will bring a collaborative stance between the two BRICS nations. The BRICS forum for cooperation includes 9 countries: the original five (Brazil, Russian Federation, India, China, and South Africa) and four recent additions, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, and United Arab Emirates.
