### The Legacy of Jiang Zemin

20 December 2022|China, China history, China politics
AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy and, in particular, life in China. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. We have written about economic development in China and China’s economic reforms, U.S.-China relations, China’s changing role in the global political economy, and the history and current state of Chinese politics. In this post, we take stock of the legacy of former paramount leader Jiang Zemin and his critical role in China’s rise over the last 40 years.
After the death of former Chinese Paramount Leader, Jiang Zemin, on November 30, 2022, the Communist Party of China (CPC) honored him as an outstanding leader and held a high-profile memorial for him. Public opinion on social media expressed deep condolences and fond memories of the former leader. That's in contrast to the criticism Jiang received during his administration.
Jiang played a significant role in China’s rise over the course of the reform era. In many ways, we might see Jiang’s reign (1989-2002) asthedefining epoch in China’s economic and political rise. In the this post, we consider the legacy of Jiang, and place his legacy in the context of China’s historic rise over the last 40 years.
A Historical Context
In the early Ming Dynasty, China was far and away the most powerful economy – contributing about one-third of the global GDP – and its military armada dwarfed that of every other country in the world. A case can also be made that China was clearly the world’s most innovative nation, contributing such world-changing innovations as gun powder, the nautical compass, paper, paper money, the printing press, and many others. After the death of Ming Emperor Yongle, however, China turned inward, and began a slow steady decline in status and power, as the West embarked on an era of exploration, mercantilism, and, ultimately, colonization.
When Mao Zedong came to power in 1949, following the Century of Humiliation (1839-1949), the Chinese people looked to the second half of the 20th Century with great hope and optimism, expecting a new chapter for the world’s most populous nation. But it did not come. Mao’s reign would further devastate the once-great Middle Kingdom.
When Mao died in 1976, China was a broken nation. The economic chaos of Mao’s Great Leap Forward saw 50 million people die of starvation. There was the chaos and upheaval of the Cultural Revolution, which saw more than a million people die at the hands of their fellow citizens and a generation of students “sent down to the countryside,” thus missing out on crucial educational opportunities. By the time Deng Xiaoping came to power in 1979, ushering in the era of China’s Economic Opening, China's stature in the modern global political economy was, perhaps, at an all-time low.
The Rise of Jiang and the Rise of China
There was great hope with Deng’s open-door policy, as it came with many reforms that would set the table for an era of economic growth. It was no longer illegal to be a private entrepreneur.[1] Chinese entrepreneurs were encouraged to copy and learn from the West. And many Chinese citizens welcomed the freedom to engage in the economy in a variety of ways.
Yet China's situation at the end of Deng’s reign was still far from optimistic. In June 1989, when Jiang was appointed CPC general secretary by Deng and other elder revolutionists, “China was at a critical moment, facing both pressure from abroad and difficulties at home,”[2]
The country faced tremendous political and economic uncertainties, with the reign (1989-2002) of Jiang and Zhu Rongji, the former premier of the PRC. It was a turning point for China. Jiang lived up to Deng’s expectations, leading China through these challenges. He resisted significant interference to ensure that China continued to carry out reforms and open up, building a solid foundation for decades to come.
By the time Jiang stepped down as CPC general secretary in 2002, China had made the fundamental transition from a sleepy planned economy dominated by the State sector to a vibrant market economy. It had weathered the massive bankruptcies of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and waves of unemployment, and had ushered in the historic moment when it joined the World Trade Organization (WTO). Externally, China withstood the pressure from the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Asian financial crisis of 1997-1998, and endured the “humiliation” brought by the United States.
During Jiang’s reign (1989-2002), the Chinese economy and society underwent transformational changes. In order to turn the spirit of Deng’s southern tour into reality, Jiang proposed to establish a “socialist market economy” and put it into the report of the 14th CPC National Congress and constitution. Controversial as this shift was within the Party, this critical move allowed the CPC to truly free itself from the shackles of traditional Maoist ideology. With the support of Jiang and under the direct leadership of Zhu, China introduced major reforms in several key areas, including public finance, taxation, baking, foreign trade, foreign exchange, planning, investment, pricing and circulation. These reforms generally established the framework of a market economy.
In this period, China had many SOEs that were woefully inefficient, financially subsidized, and uncompetitive. Jiang and Zhu showed their political and economic courage, bankrupting a large number of SOEs, replacing them with private enterprises and foreign-invested enterprises. Meanwhile, China had to avoid a potential social crisis caused by the unemployment of more than 20 million SOE employees during this period of downsizing.
In 1994, fiscal and tax reforms continued with the establishment of central and local tax-streaming systems. Through enhancement of the financial resources and authority of the central government, the reform had maintained the enthusiasm of local governments and promoted the construction of a unified national market.
Even as difficult and bold reform-oriented decisions were made during Jiang’s administration, there were also challenges. During this period, relations between China and United States were complex, and China experienced several “humiliations” at the hands of the U.S. In 1993, the Chinese container vessel Yinhe was under siege for three weeks in international waters by American warships. The U.S. refused to apologize when open inspection found no chemical weapons, which had been claimed by U.S. intelligence officials. On May 8, 1999, the Chinese embassy in Yugoslavia was bombed by U.S.-dominated NATO, killing two Chinese citizens. On April 1 2001, an American surveillance plane collided 0with a Chinese fighter over the South China Sea, causing the disappearance of the Chinese pilot.
Jiang did not overact. While lodging protests with the U.S., Jiang prevented the rise of extremism and worked to normalize China-U.S. relations. Because of these circumspect actions, he bore the stigma of being weak within China. After the 9/11 attack, Jiang immediately called President Bush to express China's support for the United States. It turns out that Jiang's forbearance avoided a direct conflict between China and the U.S., maintained China's favorable external environment, and won China a long and golden development period.
Jiang also faced significant criticism at home and abroad during the course of reforms for a number of China's challenges, including corruption, unemployment, pollution and environmental degradation, a widening gap between the rich and the poor, controversies during the implementation of the birth control policy, and the crackdown on the Falun Gong movement. Nevertheless, despite these criticisms and controversies, Jiang did not back down from his radical reform agenda.
China’s WTO Bid: Entering the Global Political Economy
China’s accession to the WTO is a milestone of opening up and engaging with the world. Many people believed that once China joined the WTO, it would crush domestic industries like the automobile, making China a vassal of international capital, Jiang and Zhu realized that China’s integration with the global economy was inevitable, and China needed to swim in the vast ocean of the global market. Joining the WTO enabled China to grab the opportunity of globalization and provided China a new engine to drive reform and modernization.
The Theory of Three Represents
It was during a February 25, 2000, speech in Guangzhou that Jiang introduced China and the world to the Theory of the Three Represents. The “three” includes (1) the development of advanced productive forces, (2) an advanced culture, and (3) the fundamental interests of the majority of Chinese people. In terms of ideology, Jiang's theory may seem simplistic or even somewhat hollow. But its central message advocated for an expansion of the CPC’s social foundation and a consolidation of its ruling position under the new historical conditions. For a decade, Jiang and Zhu had fought for the radical reform of the state sector and the further legitimization of the private sector.
Under the Theory of Three Represents, private business owners could join the CPC, something which would have been unthinkable in the past. And Jiang was arguing that the legitimization of these forces – radically reforming the state sector and laying the groundwork for a rapidly growing private sector – could be incorporated into CPC ideology without threatening the Party or its legitimacy. Placing the theory in its historical context allows us to see it as a more radical text.
One way to think about China’s radical transformation over the last four decades is to break it down into epochs of the Reform Era, which are tied to the four leaders we have described across this period. Deng ushered in the Reform Era in 1979 and stayed in the position of paramount leader until 1989. This was an era of “economic opening,” announcing to the world that China was open for business (and, by the way, China has a very large labor force). It was a period of radical change in allowing for entrepreneurship through small household business.
The era of Jiang began in 1989, and it was a period of radical transformation. Very difficult reforms of SOEs came into being: budget constraints were hardened and SOEs were forced to become more efficient. Downsizing, fiscal tax reform, and many other hard reforms were presented. It was also a period of further opening to the West, as China invited major foreign companies such as General Motors, General Electric, Volkswagen, and many others to help China build its technological and manufacturing knowledge. Finally, it was the period that saw China enter the WTO.
The era of Hu Jintao (2002-2012) was China’s first decade in the WTO when markets were open, and companies like Apple and Walmart had free reign to operate in the supply chain. (Under WTO rules. it was no longer legal to have a quid pro quo for market access.) It was also a period that saw the rise of indigenous Chinese private businesses and, in particular, technology companies such as Tencent and Alibaba, which was actually founded in 1997 but excelled in this period.
Finally, there is the era of Xi when we are witnessing a strong push for China to become the largest economy in the world and reclaim a position as one of the most powerful geopolitical players. All of these epochs are important, but, arguably, it is the era of Jiang and Zhu that was "The Greatest Leap Forward".
As a final note, what do Chinese citizens think? It takes time to assess the achievements of a leader. Changes in Chinese public opinion have revealed that Jiang is a leader who can stand the test of time. “It is a tribute to the creativity of the generation that governed China in the 1990s that we can now take for granted what was then a vision," said former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger in the Foreword ofZhu Rongji Meets the Pressin 2012. The reminiscences of Jiang are the reflections of 30 years ago. They are spirited, thriving, open, and inclusive. It is also a wish in these current troubled times that people hope China and other nations can learn from history and move towards a better future.
