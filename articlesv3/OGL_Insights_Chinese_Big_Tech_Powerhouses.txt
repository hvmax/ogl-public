### OGL Insights: Chinese Big Tech Powerhouses

24 October 2020|China
AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy and, in particular, life in China. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. We have sought to advance a conversation about the U.S.-China relationship, and a deep understanding of local economic development in China. We have written a series about the strategic strength oflocal economic development in China’s 2nd and 3rd tier citiesandentrepreneurship in China todayas well as a series aboutChina’s Belt and Road Initiative. More recently, we have been writing about the US-China Trade War as it relates toinnovation in the Chinese economy. This post adds to that conversation. – The Editorial Team

In an earlierpost, we wrote aboutWeChat, Tiktok, and the state of US-China trade relations. In this post, we continue the conversation with a little more background on the rise of China’s powerful tech giants, tech giants that are competing with the likes of Google, Facebook, and Twitter in changing the ways in which people access information and interact; in essence, the ways in which these new big tech companies are changing the world. We focus here on Tencent and Alibaba, though in earlier posts we have focused onBytedanceandHuaweias well.
Unicorn Sightings in China
In 2015, the financial industry discovered unicorns – a privately held, venture-backed company that is valued at more than one billion USD. First discussed inTheWall Street Journalin 2015, lists of unicorns have been compiled by a variety of financial publications such asTechCrunch,CNN Money, andFortune. In the earliest lists, which looked as far back to 2010, the United States dominated with 26 unicorns out of the 32 firms.
At the time, only two Chinese companies appeared on the list: a private company called Meitu, founded in 2008 and valued in December 2014 at 2 billion USD; and the already famous but still privately held Alibaba, which as of September 2014, was valued at 42 billion USD. Meitu exited the unicorn lists in December 2016 with an IPO, which valued the newly minted publicly traded company at $4.6 Billion. Alibaba shed its unicorn status with an IPO in September of 2014, valuing the publicly traded company at 238 billion USD.
In those early listings, the United States represented about 81 percent of the firms on the unicorn list and only 6 percent were Chinese firms. Four years later, China had come to dominate the unicorn list, with 131 of the 266 listed companies in August 2018. China led this list with 49 percent of the firms, while the U.S. came in second with 32 percent. And, of course, the most valuable unicorn in the world today is Bytedance. As an aside, we should note here that conspicuously absent from unicorn lists is the global powerhouse Huawei. Huawei’s unique ownership structure and its closely guarded financial information make it difficult to accurately value the company. This fact raises questions about the accuracy of unicorn lists. Nevertheless, what we are interested in here is the rapid emergence of China’s leadership in this frothy financial world.
By 2020, the U.S. was way ahead of China in sheer numbers of unicorns (228 v. 122) as of June, CB Insights reported, but a comparison of the valuation of unicorn companies revealed an intriguing twist. China dominated the mean unicorn valuation at 3.81 billion USD followed by India (3.56 billion USD) and with the U.S. coming in third (2.42 billion USD), according to market research company Affinity.
How did China grow its unicorn numbers and valuation so rapidly? First, recall that China has a Central Government that is a protectionist cheerleader. This is the government that has kept foreign competition – like Google, Facebook, and Twitter– outside its borders so China’s homegrown technology companies could survive their infancy without being gobbled up by the fierce foreign competition. It is in this protected environment that China’s national champions in the tech sector matured and thrived. The core of this group is often referred to as BAT – Baidu, Alibaba, Tencent (Huawei should be included in this group, though there are historical and sectoral reasons why Huawei is often left off).
Today, BAT(H) is in active collaboration with the Chinese government to help the nation make the transition from investment-led growth to consumption-led growth. The interesting thing today is how these tech powerhouses – Alibaba and Tencent are the two most valuable technology companies in Asia – are helping the Chinese Government build a consumption-led growth economy. Alibaba and Tencent have spent the last decade building platforms that foster consumerism and help entrepreneurial start-ups grow.
Both Tencent Holdings, Ltd (腾讯控股有限公司) and Alibaba (阿里巴巴集团) were founded in the late 1990s during the “dot com” boom. They are both Internet and Social Media companies that have grown up in the 2000s and 2010s, and there is a unique relationship between these two companies and the Chinese government. If you had traveled to China in the 2000s, you would have found a government that tolerated the private sector – and even, at times, voiced support for emerging corporate superstars in the private economy – but you would not have found a close alliance between the state and powerful private players. The Chinese government was still focused on the continuing support and reform of the inefficient state-owned enterprise sector, which accounted for about 40 percent of the national economy. But starting with the ascension of President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Keqiang in 2012, there was an important shift in the alliance between the state and the private sector. Realizing China’s economic reform process depended heavily on a successful shift from investment-led growth to consumption-led growth, the government needed innovative partners that would help foster this transition. Tencent and Alibaba became those partners.
A Look at Tencent
Tencent was originally founded in the Cayman Islands – with the backing of a significant amount of venture capital funding – and was based on the business of social media through its core product, a messaging app called QQ. Loosely translated, the company’s name means “soaring information.” The company went public on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in 2004. There are really three lines of growth that have defined Tencent’s evolution over its twenty years of existence. First, there is the social media side of things. Building on its success with QQ, in 2011, Tencent launched a second messaging app called WeChat. It started small, as an experiment, a copycat App that was essentially designed to mirror the functionality of iMessage. The product had initial success, gathering about 100 million users within the first year, though no one expected how big this “SuperApp” would become. Through gradual innovation year-by-year, they continued to add features that focused on the social networking aspects of Chinese society, and the product continued to gather momentum. The most significant innovation was WeChat’s foray into the financial world with the addition of WeChat Wallet and Quick Response (QR) Code Payments in 2014. (QR Codes, abbreviated from Quick Response Code, are essentially personalized matrix barcodes and they are the primary way in which individual and small-scale entrepreneurs access China’s growing online financial system.) In that year, WeChat’s user base-jumped to about 500 million. The product team continued to innovate, and eventually began to build in “mini-programs,” which have allowed WeChat to become a de facto operating system. Today, WeChat has about 1.3 billion users, some 970 million of whom are Chinese. While companies like Apple and Samsung typically think of Huawei, Oppo, and Vivo as their primary competitors in China, Tencent poses a greater threat than these hardware companies. As the de facto operating system for the vast majority of Chinese smartphone users, many consumers care much more about access to their WeChat accounts than they do about the hardware on which it sits.
The second area of growth and dominance for Tencent is online gaming. Tencent founded Tencent Games in 2003, and over the last fifteen years has grown to be one of the largest gaming companies in the world. In addition to developing its own games, Tencent is also the majority stakeholder in game companies like Grinding Gear Games, Supercell, and Riot Games. Tencent is the quiet publisher behind such games as Crossfire (the world’s most popular first-person shooter game and the second highest-grossing online game in the world), League of Legends (the game with the largest player base in the world), Clash of Clans and many others. Nearly half of Tencent’s annual revenue comes from its gaming empire. In 2017, Tencent rebranded its gaming unit as WeGame. Through its investments and its own internally developed games, the number of WeGame users has ballooned to over 200 million. Through WeChat and WeGame, Tencent has come to dominate China’s social ad market, with 59% of the market share.
The third area that has defined Tencent’s significance in Asia is as an investor. Beyond gaming, Tencent has its hands in many other Internet-based businesses, including search, e-commerce, online payment and banking, and video streaming, to name a few. Along with Alibaba, Tencent is among the largest investment organizations in China. Founded in 2011, Tencent’s investment arm is run by Martin Lau, who also serves as the president of Tencent Holdings – only Pony Ma (Ma Huateng,马化腾) holds a more powerful position in Tencent. The company’s investment portfolio includes some 600 companies, including such powerhouses as automotive innovator Tesla, U.S. ride-hailing company Lyft, China’s e-commerce giant JD.com, global messaging app SnapChat, Indonesian food delivery company Go – Jek, and many others. As noted by Louise Lucas, it is an “investment portfolio [that]… those of U.S. peers such as Facebook and Google.”[1]
A Look at Alibaba
Alibaba’s growth has striking parallels to Tencent’s, though the business model has a different template. In 1999, Jack Ma (Ma Yun, 马云) founded Alibaba. When the company went public in 2014, the IPO raised $25 Billion – the largest IPO in history at the time – giving the company a total valuation of $231 billion. Alibaba’s original business was based on e-commerce for the business-to-business marketplace. A few years later, in 2003, the company moved into the business-to-consumer marketplace and then, eventually, the consumer-to-consumer marketplace with the launching of the Taobao Marketplace, now the largest online shopping platform in China. (We have previously written about the impact of Taobao for China’s micro-entrepreneurs in our story of a bamboo basket maker in Sichuan province,whose wares have gone global.)
In 2004, the company launched Alipay, which would become an immediate heavyweight in the mobile payment space until WeChat Pay was introduced in 2014. Alipay was spun off in 2010 and then, in 2014, it was rebranded as Ant Financial (and now Ant Group), the most valuable financial technology or “fintech” company in the world. The amazing thing here is that The Ant Group is set to surpass the Alibaba IPO – estimated to raise $34 Billion – to, again, become the largest IPO in history. Quite an amazing record for Jack Ma and Alibaba.
Like Tencent, Alibaba is an aggressive investor; however, Alibaba’s investment philosophy is somewhat different from Tencent’s. Where Tencent invests widely in a large portfolio of companies, Alibaba tends toward a more targeted and focused investment strategy. It also often becomes deeply involved in its portfolio companies’ strategies and overall structure. In that sense, Alibaba is more like a private equity firm than Tencent, but both companies are integral to the building of China’s entrepreneurial community.
But how do these companies shape the start-up and unicorn terrain in China? Essentially, these two Internet giants have, since 2013, worked arm-in-arm with the government to build out the Chinese consumer economy. The partnership runs both ways. The government controls the economic ecosystem, keeping significant foreign competitors (i.e., Facebook, Google, Twitter) out of the market, allowing them (along with Baidu) to thrive. These Internet powerhouses, for their part, have created a bountiful economic environment in which small-scale start-ups are supported, incubated, and guided to success.[4]
A Look at Mobike
Let’s look at one more Chinese unicorn, the smaller Mobike. In the mid-1990s, Chinese streets were filled with bicycles. Major thoroughfares like Huaihai Road had full lanes devoted to bikes – two lanes for cars and two lanes for bikes. Bikes were the primary mode of transportation for the majority of Chinese citizens. As China went through the automotive revolution in the early 2000s, cities like Shanghai and Beijing were adding about 600,000 cars to the roads per year. By 2005, the bike lanes had disappeared to create an extra lane on each side for cars and busses. In 2016, there were few bicycles on the roads in the major cities, but there was a gap in the market as people still needed to travel short distances, and taxis and buses were not the most efficient way to do it. Enter Mobike (北京摩拜科技有限公司). Mobike is a bike-sharing system that provides access to bicycles to anyone who needs them. As for Mobike, the company is, by the number of bicycles, the largest shared bicycle operator in the world. And as of 2017, 18 months after Mobike launched, Shanghai had become the largest bike-share city in the world. On the surface, it looks like a successful entrepreneurial venture that clearly fulfilled a need in Chinese society. But here again, there are many organizational forces at work.
This case is also interesting because of the ways in which Mobike is integrated into the Chinese economy. Mobike is a part of the government’s pivot to an integrated economic system of a consumption-based economy.
A Dynamic Local Government
Recall again that centralized direction is only one value on the government’s side of the equation; there is also a dynamic local government. For decades, one of the most dynamic and innovative District Governments in Shanghai has been the Xuhui District, a Silicon Valley cousin. In the early 1990s, this District was the first in Shanghai to have an “Open Economic Zone” (徐匯開發區), a special zone that was more flexible in terms of regulation and free-market reforms. Working with a large state-owned development company, INESA (上海仪电控股集团公司), the Xuhui District Government built the INESA Incubator to attract entrepreneurial and innovative companies to their district. The government also invited Microsoft to set up its second incubator in China (the first was in Beijing). The Shanghai branch of Mobike itself was incubated in the INESA Incubator of Xuhui District. There, Mobike received early stage funding from Tencent. It was acquired by Meituan-Dianping in April 2018. A director at Mobike explained the dynamic among Mobike, Meituan-Dianping, and Tencent: “You have to understand, Tencent is in a battle over who controls consumer platforms in China right now. Tencent is in a fight with Alibaba, and it is all about who controls the consumer ecosystem and who controls consumer data. You asked me why a food delivery company [Meituan-Dianping] would want to own a bike sharing company. It’s not like the Meituan-Dianping employees are going to be using Mobikes. They are interested in the data. But whatever the reason, the entire dynamic has helped to continue in building the Tencent consumer ecosystem.”
Thus, in the case of Mobike, we again see the multiple players: the Central State providing direction and protecting its growing private sector from outside (i.e., foreign) competition; the Local State acting in an entrepreneurial fashion to incubate new ideas and new businesses; the private sector facilitating in a variety of ways – INESA providing space in their incubator, Microsoft providing knowhow and support, Tencent and Meituan-Dianping providing funding, and Tencent providing the platform. It is a system that, on the face of it, looks like an entrepreneurial solution to a consumer demand. However, digging a little deeper, it is clear that it is a product (bike-sharing) that has been carefully incubated and curated by the Local State, the facilitation of the private sector, and support from foreign partners.
These companies are not only shaping the growth of entrepreneurship and the pivot to a consumption-based economy, they are also shaping the very fabric of the economy. Take, for example, mobile payments defined as monetary transactions that flow through a mobile device and a mobile payment system (like Apple Pay, Alipay, or WeChat Pay). Over the years of giving talks on this topic, I have developed a bit of a reputation for being the China scholar who constantly sung China’s praises. More than once I said things like, “China is so far ahead of the U.S. in mobile,” only to be met with eye rolls from my audience of executives and engineers. Then, I would trot out this statistic: in 2017, in the United States, the sum total of mobile payments was $49.5 billion. In China, the figure was $12.8 trillion for the same time period. Meaning, the value of Chinese mobile transactions was more than 260 times that of the United States; even if you adjust for population size, China still outpaces the U.S. in this area by a factor of 65.[3]This might sound impossible, as the Chinese figure is very near the size of the entire Chinese economy. However, in China, mobile payments are essentiallythepayment system. Even beggars on the streets have personal QR codes so that passersby can contribute money to their mobile accounts.
There are many more stories to tell about China’s big tech powerhouses today. These are but a few of the tales of how Chinese technology firms that are remaking the Chinese economy and, in doing so, remaking the world.
