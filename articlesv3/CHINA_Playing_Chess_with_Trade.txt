### CHINA: Playing Chess with Trade

Flying  into Shanghai in early November, I found it more difficult to find a  hotel room than usual. Many hotels were sold out for the week of  November 4, and those that still had rooms were quoting prohibitively  high prices. It’s my fault for being so disorganized and trying to book  my hotel as I was practically touching down, but I hadn’t taken into  consideration an entirely new factor: The China International Import  Expo (CIIE) was being held in Shanghai for its second, remarkably  successful year. Only in China can the second year of a novel event turn  into a global phenomenon.
As my good friend and collaborator,  Diane Long, who spent her week running around the city from CIIE event  to CIIE event, put it, “It’s unbelievable what they have done in two  years. There is still room for improvement, but it was pretty amazing.”
What  is CIIE? Call it a global trade fair for trade – in China. Focusing on  imports into China, it drew representatives from more than 181  countries, regions and international organizations. The CIIE estimates  that more than 3,800 enterprises participated in exhibitions. The  organizers describe the event in the following way: “China is further  opening its market. Belt and road initiative is accelerating. CIIE in  its second year is the most important event around this initiative and  provides the unique opportunity for open development and cooperation  between China and the world. Companies who want to take advantage of  this need to participate at CIIE…” (CIIEsummit.org). Participation of  China’s leaders went to the highest levels, with President Xi making a  special appearance to deliver the keynote speech at the event.
First,  there is the sheer scale of the event. Estimates suggest that over  3,000 companies from more than 130 countries attended the 2019 CIIE,  putting the event at more than 36% YoY in attendance for the core target  population. According to ShanghaiEye (an online platform that reports  on what is going on in Shanghai in business and society), by  CIIE’s third day, “258 support events had been held during the CIIE,  including policy explanations, new product demonstrations, matchmaking  and contract signing, release of research findings and  performances. There were more visitors in the first three days of this  year’s event compared with entire attendance at last year’s CIIE.”
ShanghaiEye  says the National Exhibition and Convention Center saw 227,000 visitors  on November 6, and more than 100 high-level delegations participated,  including provincial and municipal government authorities, central and  private enterprises, and overseas buyers and visitors. It all looked  very impressive from the outside. And, for those who were on the inside,  it presented interesting opportunities for collaboration and learning.  As Diane put it, “CIIE is a showcase of all the international  corporations with longevity in China over 30 years, which means they  have discovered how to be successful with the right market and products,  profitability, and most importantly know how to operate in this  country. Entering this market is never easy, however, small- and  medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) should be inspired by these role  models.” (We’ll come back to this point below.)
Second, there is  the success of the entire endeavor. The numbers speak for themselves,  but this was not just a flesh-pressing and networking event. It was also  about getting deals done. This year’s CIIE resulted in more than $70  billion in deals being inked over the course of the week, (according to  CIIE.org). The matchmaking between the foreign investment community and  Chinese businesses is going to lead directly to flow of capital into  China. It is going to benefit those countries that are seeking greater  access to the Chinese market, and it is going to benefit China in its  goal of further building a consumption-based economy.
Note: This  is an interesting twist on the common rhetoric of trade relations: where  politicians and pundits like Donald Trump and Peter Navarro shallowly  obsess over trade imbalances, the Chinese government is focused on  something different – the building of a robust consumption-based  economy. And there is a clear recognition that the attraction of imports  will continue to help the country in the transition from investment-led  growth to consumption-led growth. Observing events like this reinforces  the feeling that, while Trump and Navarro are playing checkers (e.g.,  tariffs), Xi Jinping and Li Keqiang are playing chess (e.g., doing the  difficult work of deepening economic ties and economic exchange).
Given the chess game, it is interesting to note whoisengaging  in partnerships while Trump and Navarro are building walls. One of the  much scrutinized and celebrated moments of the CIIE was the extended  presence of French President Emmanuel Macron. To the surprise and  chagrin of some Shanghai residents and tourists, after their initial  meeting with Macron in Beijing, Xi and his entourage shut down the  Shanghai Gardens (豫园) to provide the French president with a special  Shanghai experience. However, this was not all show: President Macron  walked away with $15 billion in deals for French companies to sell their  goods in China. In a clear jab at the US, President Xi said that the  agreements between the two countries “sent a strong signal to the world  about steadfastly upholding multilateralism and free trade, as well as  working together to build open economies” (Reuters, “China and France  Sign Major Deals,” 11/7/19). Yet another moment in which the leadership  vacuum left by the United States’ insular turn has encouraged others to  step up and lead the way.
Third,  there is an interesting question for foreign companies: Who displayed  the best understanding of how to approach the Chinese market? Bear in  mind that, for the most part, US companies seemed to be operating in an  antiquated mode of flexing the muscles of multinational presence and  products. It should be reiterated here that a significant push in China  over the last six years (the era of Xi) has been the development of a  consumption-based economy and a big part of that goal has been the  development of small- and medium-size enterprises (SMEs). The US could  learn something from this approach, as the development of a robust  economy that benefits everyone (not just multinational corporate elites)  requires as much emphasis on SMEs as it does on the large-scale  corporate sector.
As Diane described the scene, “The US had the  largest area at the Expo, with 192 companies exhibiting, ranking fifth  in the number of company participants. What this meant is that the US  tended toward single company large pavilions. This was a stark contrast  with countries like South Korea, Australia, Canada, Switzerland, and  Singapore, which took similar space but showcased many SMEs.”
The  one (bright spot) exception for the US was the California booth.  Organized by the Bay Area Council for California brands, California  organized a large group of SMEs to maximize the exposure for as many  entrepreneurs and small-scale enterprises as possible.
Fourth,  there is the issue of “South-South Cooperation” (南南合作). This concept is  not new in China, but with the frosty turn in US-China relations, it  has taken on a new significance. South-South Cooperation refers to a  notion that emerged in development theory literatures, which designated  the “Global North” as those “developed” nations that have controlled the  majority resources in the post-colonial era (e.g., Europe, North  America), and the “Global South” as the less developed nations that were  home to many natural resources and significant swaths of the world’s  population. In China, when citizens talk of “South-South Cooperation,”  they are promoting an idea that the nation should focus less on  relations with the developed (and arrogant) nations of the Global North  and, instead, focus on building relations with Global South nations. For  example, in the shadow of the US-China trade war, there has been  significant buzz around trade relations with Peru, particularly in the  area of agricultural products. Quinoa from Peru is the new hot food in  China. China needs food, the US is slapping on tariffs, China is going  to go elsewhere to get it. As my on-the-ground collaborators also noted,  “It was a stark contrast to the US soybean pavilion, which didn’t see  much traffic at all.” There can be little doubt that the tariff war is  hurting US farmers, but it is especially jarring to observe these  effects in terms of foot traffic at such an important event.
Fifth,  the architecture of the program also displayed an additional window  into the chess game the Chinese leaders are playing. One of the  distinctive features of the Xi era has been the tight alliance between  the Chinese government and the private sector. Despite the sense that Xi  has aggressively consolidated power (which he has) and given more  support to the state sector than the previous regime (he has), he has  also built closer ties with the private sector than previous  administrations. China’s homegrown national champions – Tencent,  Alibaba, Huawei and Baidu – are no longer held at arms-length. Today,  they are close collaborators with the Chinese government.
The  CIIE program was a perfect example of this alliance. While the CIIE was  established to attract and foster the flow of foreign capital and  foreign products, one of the stars of the show was clearly Alibaba.  After two days in Shanghai, the program shifted to Hangzhou, a city  southwest of Shanghai, to visit an area commonly referred to as the  “land of unicorns.” This was an important moment for Alibaba to present  itself as a core partner in this innovative event. (Alibaba and Tencent  are the two largest investment companies for SMEs in all of Asia.)
It  was also an important time for Hangzhou to present itself as a fertile  site for developing technology entrepreneurs. While Beijing’s  Zhongguancun is often referred to as “China’s Silicon Valley,” it’s just  not true anymore. That title has clearly passed to Hangzhou (but don’t  tell Beijing). A note on Chinese unicorns: In 2015, the financial  industry discovered unicorns. In financial terms, a unicorn is a  privately held company that is valued at more than one billion USD.  First discussed inTheWall Street Journalin 2015, lists of unicorns have been compiled by a variety of financial publications, includingTechCrunch,CNNMoneyandFortune Magazinein addition toWSJ.  In the earliest lists, which looked back to 2010-14, the United States  dominated with 26 unicorns out of the 32 firms. At that time, only two  Chinese companies appeared on the list: a private company called Meitu,  founded in 2008, and valued in December 2014 at $2 billion; and the  already famous but still privately held Alibaba, which as of September  2014, was valued at $42 billion.[1]In  four short years, China would come to dominate the unicorn list, with  131 of the 266 in August of 2018. China led this list with 49 percent of  the firms, while the US came in second with 32 percent.
It is clear that “visiting the land of unicorns” (Hangzhou) was something the government wanted to celebrate. And it should.
Speaking  of unicorns, I wonder what the Communist government organizers thought  about the space they allocated to wework? Given the embarrassment this  venture has become for hallowed investment houses like Softbank and  Goldman Sachs, I wonder what Communist officials think about who is  building a better entrepreneurial economy? This is not to say that there  haven’t been a series of failures in entrepreneurial China (Ofo comes  to mind, for example), but at this particular event, wework’s presence  (not to mention the celebratory size and scale of the display booth)  made for an effective lesson in irony and entrepreneurial economics.
One  final note… In this Communist country, there is a very intelligent  logic to how the events of the last seven days unfolded. First you have a  highly touted (and successful) international conference that is about  investing in the Chinese economy. Then you have the transition of that  campaign from Shanghai to Hangzhou, with a focus on Alibaba and  e-commerce. Then, at the tail-end of the event, you stage an event that  has become the most successful consumer day on the planet – China’s  Singles’ Day.
China  leads the world not only in the area of e-commerce but also in the area  of mobile payments. (The value of mobile transactions in China outpaces  the US by a factor of about 260.) The 2019 Singles’ day saw spending of  $10 billion RMB (about $1.5 billion USD) in the first 1 minute 36  seconds. Last year, the record was $1.4 billion in the first 2 minutes.  By the end of the day, Alibaba had set a new global record for sales in a  single day – $38 Billion – crushing Amazon’s most recent “Prime”  promotion. It was an emphatic exclamation point to CIIE, driving home  the point: Chinese consumer culture is not only the largest in the  world, it is a driving economic force for China and the globe.
[1]Meitu  exited the unicorn lists in December 2016 with an IPO, which valued the  newly minted, publicly traded company at $4.6 billion. Alibaba shed its  unicorn status with an IPO in September 2014, valuing the publicly  traded company at $238 billion. We should note here that conspicuously  absent from this list is the global powerhouse Huawei. Huawei’s unique  ownership structure and its closely guarded financial information make  it difficult to accurately value the company. This fact raises questions  about the accuracy of unicorn lists.
