13th National People's Congress in May 2020.
AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy and, in particular, life in China. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. We are building an economic database of cities in China to better understand how jurisdictions cope with today’s economic and political forces, as well. We also have sought to push forward a conversation about what leadership in these times of crisis might mean. In this post, we provide some insights into our views about the National People’s Congress (NPC) on May 22. We also provide some insights from Chinese academics and leaders in the lead up to and the aftermath of the NPC. – The Editorial Team
By The On Global Leadership Team
The third session of the 13th National People's Congress (NPC), held May 22-28, was perhaps a watershed moment with respect to China’s growing role in the global economy. We would like to explore three key topics that pundits have discussed over the last week, adding our special OGL view of the nuanced history and politics behind the story.
First, there was the announcement that China would not announce a GDP number for this year. On the face of it, this point is significant because it is clear that China is taking seriously the uncertainties of the current crisis. And, rather than prioritizing growth at all costs, they are prioritizing stability and the necessity to, perhaps, tweak the current economic models. This is probably not a bad thing. In the midst of a pandemic, it shows real leadership to decide to put economic projections and plans on hold for a year and instead focus on the crisis.
“We have not set a specific target for economic growth this year,” Premier Li Keqiang told NPC delegates. “This is because our country will face some factors that are difficult to predict in its development due to the great uncertainty regarding the Covid-19 pandemic and the world economic and trade environment.”
Second, we noted China set the defense spending budgetgrowthat about 6.6 percent. We are worried about the ways in which numbers get thrown around here, so let’s cut through the ambiguity. First, China scaled back its growth in defense spending (from 7.5 to 6.6 percent), which we believe is actually a subtle signal to the world, saying: “we are not an expansionist country, and we would like to work toward engagement rather than a new Cold War.”
We have no inside information on this, but, as always in Chinese politics and business negotiations, there are subtle signals given in various decisions. Additionally, just to be clear, a 6.6 percent growth in defense spending sounds big, but let’s put that in context. The United States spends about 3 percent of its GDP on defense, or about $700 billion; China spends about 2 percent of its GDP on defense (based on the 6.6 percent growth number) or about $180 billion for 2020. In our view, for a geopolitical leader and the second largest economy in the world, 6.6 percent growth is not a big deal, and it is actually a conciliatory signal to the world.
Third, Hong Kong and Article 23. This development is difficult, and we have no commentary on whether it is right or wrong. AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to deliver nuanced analysis about things that are going on in China and in the field of leadership more generally. So, let’s add a little nuance here. First, it is important to remember the history of Hong Kong’s “independence” from Mainland China. Most Americans don’t know the history of Hong Kong’s colonial occupation by Britain. Hong Kong was taken over by Britain as a result of the Opium War (1839-42), a war that was fought over Britain’s “right” to sell opium in China. This is a shameful period in Britain’s history and made even more so when Britain made China pay for the war through reparations and occupied Hong Kong, China’s crown jewel at the time. This led to what has been called the “Century of Humiliation” (百年国耻), a period in which many in China felt that the once great Middle Kingdom was being torn asunder by colonizing Western nations. China is still digging its way out of this past, and the events in Hong Kong and Taiwan (and Tibet) today are related to this painful history.
The Implications of Article 4
When the schedule of the NPC was released on May 21, Chinese people generally knew that national security would be the most important topic of the meetings. Given the frayed relationship between the United States and China, many anticipated an aggressive stance that might usher in the beginning of a new Cold War. Members of theOn Global Leadershipteam saw data showing spikes of Google searches of “immigration” in Hong Kong, and that meant HK residents were already thinking about how they might leave in anticipation of what might be coming. When details came out at the NPC, the situation was even more tense than most people expected.
These problems date back two decades. After the British returned Hong Kong to China, it was required to "enact laws on its own to prohibit any act of treason, secession, sedition, subversion against the Central People's Government." This edict came in the form of Article 23, Hong Kong’s de facto constitution. Attempts to enact those provisions in 2003 and last year were met with widespread protests from Hong Kong residents, and the legislation was shelved.
Frustrated, China brought the issue up at the NPC in May. Beijing’s Article 4 draft establishes that, “when needed, relevant national security organs of the Central People's Government will set up agencies in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) to fulfill duties to safeguard national security in accordance with the law.”
Officials argued that significant national security risks in the HKSAR had become so destabilizing they threatened national sovereignty, security and development interests, including endangering the “one country, two systems” principle.
In our view, the submission of the Article 4 draft reflects the following:
1. China-US relations are already bad enough that China might as well go ahead. The threat by US Secretary of State Pompeo would suggest the “one country, one system” approach is already in play, which would only hurt the people of Hong Kong.
2. There is no trust on the mainland that Hong Kong will implement Article 23.
3. Macau has adopted Article 23 legislation on its own, but Hong Kong has not after 23 years. Now, China will impose a tougher law on Hong Kong.
4. Luo Huining, the former party leader of Shanxi and Qinghai provinces, was named as the new director of China’s liaison office in early 2020, and is bringing a new approach to Hong Kong governance.
5. The combination of no GDP growth target and the defense budget increases show China’s bottom-line thinking: prepare for the worst, including every level of threat from the US administration.
6. Some in social media mentioned that people watching live broadcasts said that after Article 4 was read, the applause of delegates was the loudest of the day. No doubt, there is widespread support for the proposal.
7. Other points worth noticing in the Government Work Report:
a. Language included to “Jointly implement the China-US phase-one economic and trade agreement.” ("共同落实中美第一阶段经贸协议")
b. Language included to: “We must adhere to the major policy of working with Taiwan, we will resolutely oppose and deter any separatist activities seeking ‘Taiwan independence’. China will improve institutional arrangements, policies and measures to encourage cross-strait exchanges and cooperation, deepen cross-strait integrated development and protect the wellbeing of Taiwan compatriots. By uniting the vast numbers of Taiwan compatriots against ‘Taiwan independence’ and promoting reunification, we will certainly be able to create a bright future for national rejuvenation.”
("我们要坚持对台工作大政方针，坚决反对和遏制“台独”分裂行径。完善促进两岸交流合作、深化两岸融合发展、保障台湾同胞福祉的制度安排和政策措施，团结广大台湾同胞共同反对“台独”、促进统一，我们一定能开创民族复兴的美好未来”)
c. There was no mention of the “1992 Consensus” (九二共识), which reinforced the “one China principle” in negotiations with Taiwan at that time, nor the use of “peaceful” as a modifier before the term “reunification”.
What are Top Chinese Thought Leaders Saying?
With the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic around the world, anti-globalization voices are getting louder and louder. The pandemic amplifies the weakness of globalization: business travel around the world has become an important factor in the rapid spread of the virus, and the interconnectivity of the global supply chain has been hit hard by the anti-pandemic measures of many countries, thereby further weakening the economies of these countries. The pandemic has brought uncertainty to the future development of the world economy. One of the important questions to ask is: Where is globalization going in a post- COVID-19 world?
The Crisis of Globalization
COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the globalization crisis. According to He Fan (何帆)，professor of the Antai College of Economics & Management, Shanghai Jiao Tong University，the so-called "Golden Age of Globalization", which began in the 1980s, is actually a special period. In fact, many of the problems we are facing now are caused by the rushing of globalization. Some Chinese scholars believe that the excessive pursuit of economic benefits has damaged social interests in the Western countries, caused social class differentiation, and unfair wealth distribution. These endogenous problems have caused the crisis and will eventually lead to the disintegration of globalization and the reconstruction of global industries, Wen Tiejun (温铁军), an economist, further explained.
“Judging from the ratio of global trade volume to GDP, globalization reached its pinnacle in 2008. From 2009 to 2020, we are in the process of counter-globalization”, Li Qilin (李奇霖), managing director of Yuekai Securities said. Li and Wen have noticed that other than economic concerns, the call for counter-globalization from a political perspective has also become more and more intense, especially in developed countries in North America and Europe. The focus has shifted from an economic rationale to a political one.
In order to protect geopolitical interests and national security, some countries are considering lessening their supply chain’s excessive dependence on a single country, such as China, and are giving subsidies to companies that are willing to on-shore production. Many countries have issued laws and policies to prevent domestic technology companies, R & D institutions, etc., from being acquired by foreign capital—or even seeking investments. After the financial crisis in 2008, trade protectionism and anti-globalization have been on a rise. Brexit, Donald Trump’s election in 2016, and intensification of Sino-US trade friction in 2018 highlight the results when these shift from rhetoric to action. “In the post COVID-19 world, counter-globalization will be a key variable to affect China's economy and capital markets in the medium to long term”, said Li, who is deeply concerned.
On Fox News on May 14, Donald Trump threatened to cut off relations with China and save the US some $500 billion. Economist Guan Qingyou (管清友) called the current situation a torn semi-globalization, a down-graded version. With Trump's election as president, the United States has returned to the era of isolationism, moving to decouple from China. Within six to 12 months after the pandemic is contained, very likely the US government will accelerate the decoupling process, predicted Guan. “The ‘decoupling’ of the Sino-US economy was originally thought to be unlikely because the harm to two countries was too severe. But now it seems that the possibility is increasing. In the context of the deteriorating relationship between two countries, both sides are evaluating economic and trade relations from a perspective of security rather than economic benefits, seeking absolute security indicates that two economies have to be decoupled”, echoed Jia Qingguo (贾庆国), former Dean of the School of International Relations at Beijing University.
Song Wei (宋玮), an independent economic observer, compared the United States of 2020 to the United States of the 1920s. After World War I, Presidents Thomas Harding and Calvin Coolidge opened an era of “protectionism.” This is the root of Trump's policy. The regression of globalization that began in 1921 lasted 30 years. From 2010 to now, President Obama kicked off the retreat from globalization, Trump accelerated it, and the COVID-19 pandemic has brought the process to a crisis. Turning “economic engagement” into “economic competition” is a major transformation of the US economic strategy with China, and it will mark a new watershed in Sino-US economic relations, Song further commented.
Qin Shuo (秦朔), a well-known media figure, is critical of Trump's policies on China. “Today, the way the United States suppresses Chinese companies is not wise, even from the position of Americans. The growth of Chinese companies is unstoppable. The momentum is determined by a combination of factors such as China's market size, human capital, and learning abilities, etc. The best way to safeguard American interests is to maximize the profit-sharing of such a process, through standards, rules, intellectual property, culture, capital, etc., rather than resisting the trend. The direction represented by Trump has bewildered the world. It is not so much that the power of America is declining, but that the American spirit is degenerating”, Qin wrote.
The Future of the Global Industrial Supply Chain
Retired Chongqing Mayor Huang Qifan (黄奇帆) has been vocal about the evolution of the global industrial supply chain since the outbreak of COVID-19. He understands that current system with the traditional division of work is fragile and needs adjustment. Although such division of work based on endowments is rational and helps to minimize product costs. If there are too many knots within the supply chain, together with long transportation distances, it will inevitably cause high logistics costs and long transit time. Therefore, it increases the risk of the entire industrial supply chain, especially when a global disaster like COVID-19 occurs. Huang Qunhui (黄群慧), director of Institute of Economics at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences believes that localization, regionalization, decentralization, and digitization are the future of global industrial supply chain. After the pandemic, all countries will put more emphasis on the safety and controllability of their supply chain so the trends we’re seeing will be further aggravated. “The COVID-19 pandemic is more destructive than the Sino-US trade war. The pandemic has done the most realistic and vivid stress test for globalization, which has accelerated its fragmentation and reshaping,” Song Wei commented.
How can we not only maintain the benefits of current global industrial supply chain model, but also avoid the risk of its likely breakage caused by uncontrollable factors? Mayor Huang has his solution – vertically integrate industrial supply chain clusters. Instead of horizontally scattering around the world, a typical cluster will be located within  one to three hours (50-200 km), and it is able to produce more than 70 percent of the parts and semi-finished products. In an ideal situation, professional service functions will be attracted to such clusters as well. Many Chinese scholars consider that suitable locations for such clusters in the foreseeable future are East Asia, Europe, and North America, which are the world's three largest economic centers. “To some extent, three areas will compete with each other”, said Bian Yongzu (卞永祖), researcher at the Chongyang Institute of Finance. As for America, Wen trusted the United States to have the motivation and capability to pull back some key industrial sectors to ensure its leading position in high-end manufacturing.
Mayor Huang holds an exact opposite opinion. “It will be challenging for the US to move the supply chain back. Three years ago, Trump said that he would reinvigorate American industry and withdraw from China. How many industries have actually started doing so in the past three years?” This is a game between ideology and the rules of economics.
Impact on China and China's response
There is no doubt that China will face big challenges in a post-pandemic world. “The trade war provoked by the United States is part of their De-Sinization strategy, now the Chinese economy is facing unprecedented challenge”, warned Mao Zhenhua (毛振华), Director of the Institute of Economics at Renmin University of China. In the short term, the COVID-19 pandemic will bring negative effects on foreign investments and the operation of foreign-invested companies in China. In medium to long term, due to economic transformation and upgrading, increasing operating costs, and the continuous impact of trade frictions, manufacturing industries will continue to move out of China, another warning from Guan Tao (管涛), former director of the Department of International Payments of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange. Although Guan also noted in the same article that the data from 2018 and 2019 has not revealed acceleration in the migration of manufacturers.
More experts believe that the challenges are big, but they are still manageable for China. A single, gigantic market with 1.4 billion people, and with over 300 million middle class, requires multi-national companies to act with prudence. He Fan made it very clear, “protectionism will definitely raise prices”. Mayor Huang persuaded multinational companies facing gloomy economic outlooks to “retain cash and reduce investment rather than make new capital expenditures”. Actually, he meant that it is unwise to abandon matured production capacity in China and make new investments elsewhere.
Li Zhan李湛, Chief Economist for Zhongshan Securities, summarizes China’s advantages: China is the only country in the world with complete industrial supply chains and supports. China’s excellent infrastructure makes cargo transportation and the movement of personnel very convenient, which has greatly reduced production costs. Although labor cost keeps increasing, the skill, professionalism, and diligence of Chinese workforce is much better than most other countries. “Made in China” is still competitive from an economic perspective.
Facing changes in globalization, all experts believe that China should keep opening up and cooperating with other countries, especially in the post- COVID-19 world. China should accelerate the pace of reform and development domestically and, importantly, do China’s own things well. There is great potential to improve China’s domestic economic environment in areas like market accessibility, market fairness, the legal system, innovation mechanisms, etc. The only solution is keeping reforms moving and opening up.
“It is a mistake to advocate that all core-tech products must be homemade. If an enterprise or industry wants to maintain market competitiveness, it must acquire the best possible resources on a global scale, especially in high-tech industries”, emphasized Mei Yuxin (梅育新), a researcher at the Ministry of Commerce. “For those emotional expressions and practices of the US on China, give them some time to calm down and (return to a) rational and pragmatic approach. In the short term, what China needs to do is trying best to stabilize Sino-US relationship, at least to slow down the speed of declining”, Jia said in a recent interview.
Finally, we’d like to conclude with advice to Chinese entrepreneurs from Qin Shuo: “There is still a long way for Chinese enterprises to grow from big to powerful, to great and getting global recognition. Illuminate the road ahead and inspire our hearts with the light of civilization. Let us be humbler, more compliant, more peaceful, more open, and we will become stronger.”
