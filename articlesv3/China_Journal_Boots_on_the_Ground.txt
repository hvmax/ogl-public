### China Journal: Boots on the Ground

7 December 2023|China, China history, China politics, Economic Development
AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide analyses about leadership in the global economy. In this post, Dr. Doug Guthrie, who is a co-founder of OGL, continues to curate a special series of China Journal entries over the next two weeks as he returns to China for the first time in four years. Dr. Guthrie discusses his first field interview with a respected entrepreneur in this post.
After a jetlagged, fitful night, I got myself ready for my first on-the-ground, face-to-face meeting with a Chinese executive in over four years. These meetings used to be the bread and butter of my research and credibility as a China scholar. Indeed, it is these kinds of face-to-face, onsite meetings that made my work recognizable.
There are many ways to analyze economic development, economic transformation, and economic opportunity. In emerging economies like China’s, one of the problems in the early stages is trusting the data. Back in the 1990s, there tended to be two ways researchers analyzed China’s economic growth – government produced macro-economic data and on-the-ground ethnographic data gathering. You could rely on the state-produced and get the big picture – for example, Barry Naughton’s excellent bookGrowing Out of the Plan), but you never knew how deeply you could trust the source of the data.
Like Naughton, a researcher can pursue and interrogate large datasets and compilations of macro-level statistics, data on national and sectoral level economic development, data like Gross Domestic Production (GDP), Purchasing Power Parity (PPP), aggregate macrolevel data of economic flows at various levels of the economy – national, provincial, municipal, district, township, village, sector, etc., and gain a picture of the broad economic conditions. These data and the studies that employ them are useful, and they are most commonly used in policy setting and punditry analyses of how an economy like China’s is faring. But they don’t allow you to see and hear people speaking up close and personally about their experiences in this rapidly developing economy.
Or you could spend a year working in a factory watching and experiencing the day-to-day interactions that shape the lives of people in the economy. For example, Emily Watson's research and her excellent bookFactory Girl. Or she went deep on the experiences in a single case study, gaining a deep understanding of life in these transitions. The problem here are the questions that inevitability arise about the generalizability of the case. I just have always believed that this approach to data gathering is superior to gathering and analyzing macro-level data.
My own research has always gravitated toward gathering data on the ground through face-to-face interviews. I was never an ethnographic anthropologist in my research, but I was always determined to sit down with a factory director or an entrepreneur, building a rapport and trust, asking hard questions, convincing them to tell you the real story and give you the real data. When doing my doctoral dissertation research, I was adamant about gathering data and assembling a dataset through on-site face-to-face interviews. I visited 150 Chinese State-Owned Enterprises during that time and assembled a dataset that would lay the groundwork for my dissertation and first book,Dragon in a Three-Piece Suit: The Emergence of Capitalism in China.
The fact that I was back in China after four years away meant that I was going to be sitting down and talking with people working in today’s economy, experiencing the reality of China today, a very different world than in 2019. It was not until this return trip to China that I realized how attached I had become to the scholarly identity I had developed around this approach to data gathering. Being back here and having the opportunity to sit down with key players in the economy was more than exciting to me. I waited for my research partner, Chris Gao, to pick me up at my hotel. He had scheduled an interview with John Lin, Founder, Chairman and CEO ofXvisioTechnology.
Xvisio is a small, cutting-edge firm in the AR/VR/XR space. One of its top products is the SeerLens™ AR glasses, which includes built-in 6DOF tracking. It is feature-rich, easy to use, cost effective, and lightweight, and its use cases range from education and training to AR surgery navigation to AR vision correction. While it was founded in Silicon Valley in 2016, its headquarters is in Shanghai, and it has expanded its footprint to Europe for R&D and product development.
Lin is Chinese, but he spent several years in Silicon Valley, so he gave off a compelling cross-cultural feeling in his approach to our conversation. This entrepreneur built his company on technology’s ability to create virtually real experiences – the ability to feel like you are present, having an experience in a reality, even while that reality is computer generated. Yet, he began the conversation thanking us for coming to visit him and sit down face-to-face and noting how important in-person meetings are for building trust. I loved the discussion and the moment as affirming my value of face-to-face, on-the-ground experience. Yet, it was ironic that someone who produces and sells VR experiences was affirming how important real meetings are.
Although Lin’s English was perfect, I did my requisite showing off a bit, speaking in Chinese to make sure the interviewee knew how committed I had been to learning the Chinese language and culture over the course of my research life.
As the interview unfolded, we spent time talking about his company, his views on the AR/VR/XR technology, and the opportunities and challenges he saw in the marketplace. The interview lasted about an hour. We were very thankful for the time spent and expressed how excited we would be about continuing the conversation on another date.
As we drove back to the hotel, I basked in the excitement of how wonderful it felt from a research perspective to be back on the ground here. This is what doing research in China is about. I felt a sense of relief sweeping over me.
Doug Guthrie has been a China scholar since the late 1980s, when he began studying Chinese language, literature and history at the University of Chicago. After graduate work at the University of California, Berkeley, he was a Professor of Management and Sociology at New York University for several years (1997-2010) and served as Dean of the School of Business and Vice President for University China Operations at the George Washington University (2010-14). From 2015-2019, he was a Senior Director at Apple and was based in China. Currently, he is Professor of Global Leadership at the Thunderbird School of Global Management, where he is also Director of China Initiatives and Executive Director of Thunderbird Global.
