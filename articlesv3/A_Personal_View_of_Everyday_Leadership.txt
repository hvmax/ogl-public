### A Personal View of Everyday Leadership

28 August 2020|Everyday Leadership, Leadership, Leadership Development
AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. Several of us have advised companies and taught about leadership over theyears, and we have developed atheoryof leadership that takes us away from the charismatic leader to the person on the ground fighting for the team, community, or family. In this post, we seek to continue our advancement of a view of everyday leadership. – The Editorial Team
In other posts and articles on our theory ofEveryday LeadershipI have recounted my approach to this topic, which I have developed mostly through teaching about it over the years. In business school classrooms, leadership professors learn to tell MBA students, Executive MBA students and rising executives inside of corporations: be charismatic, be bold, have a vision, be strategic, inspire your people. Simply, make people want to follow you. Over the years, I have stopped teaching leadership this way. It just seems wrong. Those approaches to teaching leadership produce leaders who think of themselves as special and different. I was interested in teaching young people how to be better people. I wanted to teach young professionals that empathy and caring are as important as being bold and charismatic.
It’s funny how some of these lessons track back to the rules of the road our parents gave us when we were children. I had that reminder when I thought about an experience I had in Wales when I was 11. My family was living there for six months in the 1980s, and I was desperately trying to fit in, mostly trying to be cool.
There was a kid in my class named Stephen who struggled. He was the only black kid in the school, and he also had significant learning difficulties. The kids were cruel to him. When Valentine’s Day came, I learned that it was tradition for kids to set up a box and receive cards from the kids who wanted to cement a friendship. I had a long talk with my mom the night before. I was considering all the kids I wanted to be “cool” with. She said, “What about Stephen?” I sort of rolled my eyes and said, “Mom…”
She then gave me a gentle lecture about what Quakers do in the world, about loving everyone, about helping people in need. I decided to give Stephen a card. When I was leaving the classroom for the day, Stephen was waiting for me outside. He was holding the card, hands trembling and tears in his eyes. He said to me, “Doug, I don’t know if you made a mistake, but no one has ever given me a Valentine’s card before. Can I be your friend now? I will be your friend forever.”
Recounting that story still makes me cry, and I am thankful for my mother’s leadership in that moment. That is everyday leadership—a type of leadership moms and dads do all over the world every single day. Ironically, I rarely hear my students mention their parents or relatives as admired leaders when I ask them which leaders they respect. They invariably say Steve Jobs, Nelson Mandela, Hillary Clinton, Deng Xiaoping (if I am teaching in China), or Barack Obama. They are dazzled by the “bigness” of these people—and the personalities that come with charismatic leadership. But in being dazzled, they are also allowing themselves to be diminished. Who can measure up to a remarkable icon like Mandela? Who would even try?
A second question I ask is when will you consider yourself a leader? The answers are usually lodged in the future: when I get promoted to senior director; when I become a senior manager; when I become a vice president; when I am leading a large team. My response is: “Forget about waiting for that promotion. What about tomorrow? What about today? What about grabbing leadership today when you walk out of this classroom?” I watch people shift in their seats, intrigued but a little uncomfortable. I then launch into our theory of Everyday Leadership – Everyone Everyday a Leader. Leadership is not about the position you are in; it is about how you shape the lives of the people around you every day.
I come to Everyday Leadership after learning some very hard leadership lessons in life. I have served in important management positions in the past, and I have felt the power of holding such assignments at a relatively young age. I must admit that I have failed dramatically in some of those situations. Often the fault was my own, and at other times, it was a reflection of my suitability for the job in the first place. At every turn, I have been reminded that my charismatic leadership, which I gave great weight, could not sustain an organization if the rest of its workforce was disillusioned and unwilling to cooperate by leading in their roles.
In some of my classes, I show a clip from the movieAny Given Sunday, in which the coach, played by Al Pacino, gives an inspiring halftime speech to rally his team. The speech is largely about his failures and mistakes in life. I then ask participants, “Why is that speech inspiring? He spent most of the time talking about his failures…” Participants often say, “Well, he is trying to help them not make the mistakes he made.” For me, the answer is much more: the coach is sharing his failures and weaknesses, and, in doing so, there is the potential for connection to his vulnerability and a sincerity in his leadership. I have experienced major failures in leadership positions, and I often talk about them in my executive education classrooms. Students sometimes come to me after class and ask: "Why did you tell us about that? That must have been very painful. It's surprising to hear you talk about it so openly." My answer: My discussion of my failures is presented to build that connection with my students and with our readers.
We at On Global Leadership will continue to discuss Everyday Leadership in our blog, and call out great examples of talented leaders. For me, this has become a personal crusade—one that is driven by my interests in leading and my desires to empower individuals in the places where they live and work today, and not just in a distant and undefined future. In this post, I am remembering the leadership of my mom and her thoughts about a needy, insecure kid who needed a friend.
