### Creative Leadership: Humility and Being Wrong

During one of the 2004 presidential  debates, an audience member stood up and asked Democrat John Kerry if he  could give an example of when he had been wrong about something. The  questioner was asking the question as a measure of character and trying  to divine whether Kerry, like President George W. Bush, was a leader who  never admitted an error in judgment. (Bush had been adamant in the  contention that “no mistakes were made” in the Iraq War.)
Confronted with this opportunity, Kerry not only swung and missed, he  didn’t even understand the question being pitched. Kerry immediately  launched into an answer about how “his side” had not been wrong about  the war; that Bush’s team was the group that deserved blame; and he  spent his 90 seconds recounting Bush’s failures. Kerry was unable to  perceive the value in admitting error. The message to voters was clear:  he would probably be a leader not much different from Bush.
This is not uncommon for leaders. After all the ego structure of  people who rise to the top of organizations, and in politics, is such  that the more confident you are, the surer of yourself you are and the  more successful you are likely to be.
In an era where out-size, narcissistic business leaders are  treated like rock stars, with the requisite cult followings, of course,  elevating humility as an essential trait for creative leaders may seem  quaint, even a bit anachronistic. Yet, humility and the ability to admit  error may be two of the most important qualities a truly creative  leader must have.
Creative leaders must be more than big personalities if they hope to  lead successful organizations. They must be deeply in tune with human  behavior, and, most critically, understand who they are and what  motivates them to success and what precipitates their failures.
One of the central precepts of our new theory of CreativeLeadershipis that by embracing humility, creative leaders advantage their  organizations and themselves. Moreover, leaders must not only recognize  their failures but also acknowledge them publicly. In being wrong, they  can find both authenticity and opportunity.
Creative leadership is built on the idea that everyone at every level  in the organization is a leader; that leaders must know themselves,  alert to their failings and graces, to better serve the organization;  and that only by mastering complexity – both human and organizational –  will leaders be able to achieve alignment.
The dictionary defines humility as modesty and lacking in pretense,  but that doesn’t mean humble leaders are meek or timid. A humble leader  is secure enough to recognize his or her weaknesses and to seek the  input and talents of others. By being receptive to outside ideas and  assistance, creative leaders open up new avenues for the organization  and for their employees.
A creative leader is self-aware and not weighed down with  insecurities, constantly worrying about how they are perceived by their  employees and peers. Their egos reflect the reality of their personality  and circumstance. They are not selfless and without ego; they have a  healthy sense of self that doesn’t respond to threats. From this  emotional vantage point, they are able to effectively lead their  organizations.Leaderswho cultivate humility don’t trade on hubris, nor are they guilty of  denigrating their colleagues or competitors to aggrandize themselves.  Quietly confident, they inspire others to tap their talents and to seek  achievement, all in service to the organization and its mission.
Keith Reinhard is just this type of leader. Both of us are unabashed  admirers of Keith, the CEO Emeritus of DDB Worldwide, the global  marketing and communications giant. We have known him for several years  through our work with the Berlin School of Creative Leadership, and he  has been a source of great wisdom and advice about creative leadership.
The self-effacing Reinhard has said one of his highest goals as a  leader is empowering his people as much as possible. He believes that,  “people respond to leaders who give credit to their team for success and  take responsibility upon themselves for failures.”
Some leaders contend that admitting error is a sign of weakness and  an open door for allegations of illegitimacy. So often the opposite is  true. What is more powerful than an individual who can stand in front of  his or her employees and admit that the failure was his or hers? What  better way to gain the respect and admiration of your team than to take  the blame and responsibility on yourself rather than calling out someone  on your team? By admitting you are wrong, by taking blame, you will  have a group of more committed followers.
The work of Kathryn Schulz, the author ofBeing Wrong, is  particularly on point here. Schulz notes: “As a culture, we haven’t…  mastered the basic skill of saying ‘I was wrong.’ This is a startling  deficiency, given the simplicity of the phrase, the ubiquity of error,  and the tremendous public service that acknowledging it could provide.”
We are frequently taught that leaders, especially aspiring leaders,  should hide weaknesses and mistakes. This view is flawed. It is not only  good to admit you are wrong when you are; but also it can also be a  powerful tool for leaders—actually increasing legitimacy and, when  practiced regularly, can help to build a culture that actually increases  solidarity, innovation, openness to change and many other positive  features of organizational life.
But there is a deeper, more profound, point that Schulz makes in her  wonderful book. It is that when you are open to the idea of being wrong,  when you truly believe that another path might be better and are not  cowed by it, you will be a more creative and innovative person. You will  take more risks; you will explore more paths with unknown outcomes; and  you will build a better organization.
Individuals who know themselves are courageously able to pursue  creative leadership. What is profoundly powerful about embracing  humility and publicly acknowledging errors is the link between  authenticity and the success of the individual and the organization.
