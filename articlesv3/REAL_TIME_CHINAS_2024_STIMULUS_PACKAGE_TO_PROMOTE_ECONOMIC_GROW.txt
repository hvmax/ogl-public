On Global Leadership’s regular feature OGL Real Time presents our up-to-the-minute insights on current news and events. We hope these breaking news insights from our OGL team members will help illuminate the events of the day and provide the depth needed to understand global political, economic, and cultural transitions and transformations. In this post, we reflect new economic stimulus package. We consider the sentiments inside China, on the economic impact of the package, as well as some of the views from the world outside China. We examine a variety of important issues raised by this announcement, taking into account our own views as well as what the OGL team in China sees in local media, social media, and popular sentiment. We would like to thank Vivian Shen for her research support on this OGL Real Time article.
China's decision-makers are implementing a significant fiscal stimulus to boost economic growth. The long-awaited package of fiscal policies has mainly been implemented, including increasing debt limits, issuing special government bonds, leveraging special bonds, targeted funds, and tax policies.
These policies are aimed at resolving local debt risks, supporting large state-owned commercial banks, promoting the stability of the real estate market, and increasing support for key groups. Conservative estimates show that the scale of this package of incremental fiscal policies may be more than 5 trillion yuan, with the focus on debt reduction and the “three guarantees” at the grassroots level (guaranteeing basic citizens’ livelihood, wages and operation). Together with the package of incremental monetary policies previously issued by the Central Bank, the policies will jointly promote the recovery of China’s economy and provide support for faster growth in the next two years.
The fiscal stimulus policy could have a profound impact on China’s economy in a couple of key areas. First, the consumer market could pick up, especially in the field of durable consumer goods such as home appliances and automobiles, and the replacement of old items with new ones will trigger a new consumption boom. Consumers are awaiting a signal from the Chinese government that the economy is going to be supported, and the assumption/theory here is that this signal from the Government will spur confidence in the economy and, thus, spur consumption. Second, the resolution of local debts and the issuance of special bonds will enhance the investment confidence of enterprises, especially in the fields of infrastructure and technological innovation. As we have written in many previous posts, there is a close, collaborative relationship between the Central Government and the innovation of local governments (“Local Governments as Industrial Firms!”), and the CG’s signaling of support for the local government in these difficult economic times, will be important for spurring investment and growth. By issuing special treasury bonds to supplement the core tier-one capital of large state-owned commercial banks, the banks’ risk resistance will be enhanced, credit expansion will be promoted, and the financial system will be stabilized. The scale of the expected debt reduction may reach 3 trillion yuan. In addition, special bonds support the acquisition of existing commercial housing and the supply of affordable housing, which will help the real estate market to stabilize.
These policies are set to promote the recovery of China’s economy in a number of key areas, including infrastructure, technological innovation, new energy, and other fields. The investment will increase substantially, and the upgrading and transformation of manufacturing and service industries will accelerate.
At the same time, the fiscal pressure on local governments will be alleviated, and significant progress will be made in the resolution of hidden debts. In terms of consumption, subsidies and tax incentives for middle- and low-income groups will enhance residents' consumption capacity and drive a comprehensive recovery in all areas of the economy.
The Stimulus Package
The Chinese Government introduced its economic stimulus measures (incremental policies) to promote economic growth, structural optimization and sustained momentum of development on September 24, 2024. It is the biggest stimulus move since the 4-trillion-yuan stimulus in 2008 after the global financial crisis. What are the contents these stimulus measures and what do they mean?
The introduction of these stimulus measures indicates that Beijing’s reading on China’s economy and its way of regulation and control have undergone tremendous changes. China’s new economic development cycle has begun after years of hesitation.
Begun under the Jiang Zemin and Zhu Rongji administration in the late 1990s, the stimulus has  continued. Successive Chinese governments have issued many policies to promote consumption, but the results have not been satisfactory. The geopolitical situation and COVID made things worse. Since the second quarter of 2023, China’s GDP deflator has been negative for six consecutive quarters, a sign that China’s economy is in fact in deflation. After December 2023, China’s fiscal revenue had been declining year-on-year for nine consecutive months and would not turn positive until September 2024. From time to time, news about checking decades-old back taxes (1) and an abnormal increase in confiscation income (2) have affected the investment environment and the confidence of entrepreneurs especially the private sector.
From the Central Economic Work Conference in December 2023 to the third plenary session of the 20th Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and the Political Bureau meeting of the CPC Central Committee in July, a series of more vigorous economic stimulus measures still has not boosted the capital market and changed the pessimistic expectations. In this context, the CPC Politburo changed its routine schedule and moved forward the monthly meeting discussing economic issues to September, during which it set the tone for substantial monetary easing to stimulate the economy.
On surface, the stimulus package is in response to downward pressure on the economy, and China’s top leaders have apparently realized that the theory and methodologies of macroeconomic regulation and control in the past are no longer suited to the current state of China’s economy, and changes have to be made. We can’t ignore and underestimate the impact of such mindset shift and hope it is not too late.
In the new economic cycle, the logic of China’s economic development is undergoing subversive changes:
On the fiscal and financial sector, the issuance of ultra-long special treasury bonds suggests that anchor of the renminbi or RMB has changed from foreign exchange reserves to domestic assets. The statements made by the central bank and the Ministry of Finance both indicate that China’s version of quantitative easing is on the way.The momentum of economic growth is shifting from the production side to the consumption side, and the means of promoting consumption has begun to focus on improving household consumption capability.The major function of the capital market is shifting from financing enterprises to investment returns.Real estate’s role as a pillar and crucial driver of the Chinese economy has been reconfirmed. Supporting new pillar industries does not necessarily mean abandoning old pillars (3). For now, the success of China’s economy relies on the performance of the real estate market.

Over the past few years, China’s economy has been stuck in a negative feedback loop. The weakening capital markets and real estate market led to a lack of confidence among residents, then a decrease in consumption, and “cost reductions and layoffs” of enterprises; residents became more worried about the future, their confidence was even weaker, consumption was further reduced, aggregate total demand was further reduced, and the property market and stock market kept being sluggish. This time, Beijing is sending out very strong positive signals, aiming to break such negative feedback loop through a series of stimulus policies.
The package of incremental policies to stimulate China’s economy was designed to strengthen counter-cyclical macro policy adjustment, expand effective domestic demand, escalate efforts to support enterprises, stabilize the real estate market and boost the capital market (Figure 3 and Figure 4).
According to National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), China’s top economic planner, as of 10/22/2024, nearly half of the incremental policies have been implemented. Policies on the way include:
Expand project list that allows the special bonds to be used as capital investment;Raise the standard of student financial aid, and expanding its coverage;Increase the amount of national student loans for undergraduate and graduate students and lowering the interest rate of the loan.
• Expand project list that allows the special bonds to be used as capital investment;
• Raise the standard of student financial aid, and expanding its coverage;
• Increase the amount of national student loans for undergraduate and graduate students and lowering the interest rate of the loan.
In the next step, NDRC plans to issue policies to promote more private capital to participate in the construction of energy, transportation and other major infrastructure projects, support capable private enterprises to take the lead in undertaking major national technological research tasks and further open up major national scientific research infrastructure to private enterprises.
Following the implementation of these policies, the market sentiment has improved with a warming stock market, a rebound of the purchasing managers’ index in the manufacturing sector, and a vital consumption market during the National Day holiday. “There is enough support for the sustained economic recovery in the fourth quarter, and we are confident of achieving annual growth target”, said NDRC in a recent CGTN interview.
Compared with the 4 trillion yuan ($586 billion) economic stimulus package in 2008, many people care about the overall scale of recent stimulus package. So far, there is no clear official answer to this question. The number will come out after the meeting of China’s top legislature to be held from November 4th -8th, coincided with the United States presidential election.
How much stimulus does China need? It depends on what Beijing plans to achieve. We expect that the policies and measures taken so far will ensure the accomplishment of China's 2024 economic target, i.e., grow its GDP at about 5% (not less than 4.8%) in 2024. If Donald Trump is elected as the next president of United States and significantly raises import tariffs on Chinese products, there is no doubt that Beijing will introduce bigger stimulus to hedge the negative impacts. In the words of Finance Minister Lan Fo’an, “the central government still has a lot of room for more borrowing and increasing deficit”.
