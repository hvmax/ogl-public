### China, Mining, Rare Earth Metals, and the Global Economy

20 October 2021|China, Economic Development, Trade
AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy and, in particular, life in China. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. Our in-depth research often focuses on the social and economic transformation of Chinese society. Recently, OGL’s Doug Guthrie served on a panel discussing China’s mining industry, the mining of rare earth metals, and the geopolitics of the commodities trade.– The Editorial Team.
I was recently interviewed by Melissa Sanderson at the Mining Law Summit at Arizona State University. Mel has worked for many years in the global mining industry with Freeport-McMoRan Inc. After retiring from Freeport, Mel founded a mining consultancy, based in Phoenix, and consulting on the flow of global commodities around the world.
I was asked to speak about China as it relates to the flow of global commodities. As Mel introduced herself, she said, “We are interested in discussing perceptions around China’s approach to commodities, access to minerals and rare earths, development of mines, relationships to society. Do they respect the principles of environment, sustainability and governance (ESG), and what are the realities? Probably, I am going to be Miss Perception here, and Doug is going to be Mr. Reality. Let’s get into it.”
