AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. Several of us have advised companies and taught about leadership over theyears, and we have developed atheoryof leadership that takes us away from the big personality or charismatic leader to the person on the ground fighting for his or her team, community, or family. In this post, we seek to continue our advancement of a view of everyday leadership in this day and age. – The Editorial Team

Walid Morad and Nitin Rana met more than 20 years ago and later studied at New York University’s Stern School of Business. Like most friends who considered working together, finding the right collaborative project would prove as much an art as a science.
Until recently. The two friends came together in the last 18 months for an unlikely entrepreneurial effort—one that matched their financial services skills with their creativity and passions. Remarkably, they found their prospects in halal—most commonly known as the dietary standard for food that is permissible to eat under Islamic law.
These enterprising partners formed Omega Capital Partners, a U.S.-based investment company focused on Shariah-compliant investment opportunities with a primary focus on the halal food industry. Why halal? The healthy halal lifestyle matches the current healthy food and well-being movement. Halal is enormously beneficial for health, and it crosses a number of sectors, including food, pharmaceutical, and health care.
“I didn’t know much about what it really meant other than it means good food,” says Rana, an accomplished financial services professional. “The halal ecosystem is restricted. It’s a cleaner way of life. If I want to eat something good, it has to be halal. If I want to go somewhere for travel, I have to have halal-grade things available to me. We could be good and do good.”
In our theory ofEveryday Leaders, we at On Global Leadership believe leaders are forged in the day-to-day work of organizations. But they’re also individuals who see opportunity where others don’t, and they have an internal drive that allows them to explore their creative entrepreneurship in ways both novel and significant. In this case, the friends were trying to catch lightening in a bottle by leveraging the beneficial health effects of halal when global interest in well-being is at its height.
Morad came to the business through investment financing. For years, he was actively involved in Islamic financing in the mortgage industry world of Shariah-compliant financing. Omega takes a different path by investing in smaller-scale entrepreneurs who are building halal-focused businesses.
“We invest in early stage companies that we feel we can take up the ladder to consolidate them with someone else, given the market share and the nature of the business,” says Morad, noting that halal dietary requirements are followed by most of the 1.8 billion Muslims around the globe.
Incorporating the fund in 2018, the two men have been actively building the fund’s foundation. In the early stages of the fund, they’re focusing on the food industry and then will expand to pharmaceuticals and nutritional supplements, cosmetics, and modest fashions. “Halal is a lifestyle,” says Morad.
Beyond halal, what each of them share is a passion for leadership and building an organization that benefits from a corps of intuitive, self-motivated, and creative individuals. Morad says this matters to investors because they care about the quality of the teams they’re capitalizing. Employees working in cooperation to create the right organizational culture for success can sidestep the deleterious effects of failed leadership, which has too
“You have a lousy leader at the top of an organization, and the whole organization suffers,” says Morad. “Somebody has money and starts a business, but that doesn’t make him or her a good leader. What bad leadership does is leave a lot of money on the table through an exodus of employees and contracts. Everyday leadership is a response to that. It’s simple and it works.”
Morad and Rana understand human complexity and operational dynamics. Even more importantly, everyday leaders know themselves and are sensitive to the people around them and how their presence shapes and influences a room. The anchors of our Everyday Leadership framework are organized around five key themes: complexity and alignment, humility and being wrong, democracy, introspection, and creativity.
This kind of leadership is built and sustained through everyday action because it insists on full participation of everyone. Our leadership goal isn’t the creation of effective leaders alone., it is the creation of successful organizations that are guided by far-sighted, humble, and creative leaders.
Rana believes that while everyone can be a leader, the organization still requires someone to lead by example. Whether a president of a company or an organization, someone at the top needs to lead by example. It’s important that junior people have access to someone with more experience.
“I don’t expect any of my people to work any harder than I do. The people at the working group level have to have access to all the senior leaders in the organization. You alone as one person will not be able to drive all the changes in an organization or its culture, the power lies in the people working day to day to solve the problems,” says Rana.
For Morad and Rana, the everyday leadership approach is characterized by a number of factors including: doing well and doing good; finding an interesting market niche and responding to a cultural need; encouraging bottom-up thinking; and building a strong organizational culture from top to bottom.
Morad thinks the leadership equation is simple – and too often complicated by the drive for power and authority from above. “It’s everyday little things that add and work cumulatively to make the bigger picture or the organization operate. They contribute to it,” he says. “As opposed to somebody with a big stick coming from the top down. It doesn’t work anymore, especially with the millennials. The bottom up is a better approach, at least in my experience after running into extremely lousy leader inside companies.”
This thinking about leadership might seem mundane and quotidian in comparison to flashier manifestos of the charismatic leader who pops fully formed from a mother’s womb. What we are proposing is a simple framework – built on a deep understanding of human behavior and interpersonal relationships – that’s sole purpose is creating an effective organization.
In everyday leadership, sometimes the best choice is not counting on a single individual to save the day, but rather looking for a more versatile, creative, and universal leadership that engages everyone, every day. Morad and Rana found that in themselves, and they continue to look for it in the companies they seek to capitalize.
