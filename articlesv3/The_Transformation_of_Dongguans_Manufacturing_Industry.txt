AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy and, in particular, life in China. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. We have sought to advance a conversation about the U.S.-China relationship, and a deep understanding of local economic development in China. We have written a series about the strategic strength oflocal economic development in China’s 2nd and 3rd tier citiesandentrepreneurship in China today. This post adds to that conversation. – The Editorial Team

On Global Leadership’s original research tracks data on 37 Tier One, Tier Two, and Tier Three cities in the Xi Jinping era of economic development. Our goal is to go deeper than standard macroeconomic indicators and to go beyond the standard cases that are the common targets for focusing on development and economic opportunities in China. We focus on economic indicators such as electricity usage, total loan balance, real estate development investment, car ownership, and many others. Like most economic modeling, we use these variables to predict economic growth, but we are looking for clues to economic growth that are a bit off the beaten path. In aprevious posts, we explored the economic development of Foshan City and Suzhou.
In anearlier post, we described economic development in China this way: “Economic development in China is fundamentally shaped by government guidance and centralized control. There is a lot of strategic planning going on in five-year plans, 10-year plans, and 20-year plans… While we often think of the Chinese government as an authoritarian, protectionist, and centralized party in Beijing, that is only one side of the government. In reality, local governments are the engines driving China’s growth. Indeed, the Chinese government is an extremely decentralized and entrepreneurial system of district and township governments. The mayors of China’s districts, townships, and villages behave like corporate CEOs, focusing on Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), pursuing foreign investment, and advancing their own careers through the financial and economic achievements in their districts and townships… But local governments don’t do it alone. They do it through close coordination with China’s private sector and with foreign investors from abroad.”
In this post, we will dig deeply into Dongguan (东莞), a city in China’s Guangdong Province that is reemerging as a cutting-edge industrial hub dedicated to advanced manufacturing.
The Development of the World’s Factory
Dongguan sits very close to Hong Kong, and in 1978, the first foreign-invested enterprise in Mainland China appeared there. Since then, Dongguan's economy has grown rapidly, forming an economic model that is dominated by manufacturing and highly dependent on foreign trade. Dongguan is known as the factory of the world.
Dongguan ranks fourth in GDP among Guangdong Province cities, lagging behind Shenzhen, Guangzhou, and Foshan. Seventy-five percent of Dongguan’s population is migrant workers, with only 1.9 million of its 8.34 million inhabits registered as residents. This is a story of Dongguan.

In the mid-to-late 20th century, a common trend in international industry was transferring labor-intensive production by multinational companies from labor intensive markets like the United States to cheaper labor regimes like China. Taking the advantage of location and connections, as well as a large labor supply, the Pearl River Delta region in Guangdong Province quickly realized industrialization, of which Dongguan is an obvious representative. From 1978 to 2019, Dongguan experienced an average annual economic growth rate of 15 percent, its GDP reaching $137.5 billion, ranking 19th among cities in China’s Mainland.
Dongguan’s manufacturing industry’s development has been divided into four stages since 1978:
From 1978 to 1989, the initial stage. Dongguan mainly attracted investment from Hong Kong and developed processing trade like CMT (cut, make, and trim) for apparel, textiles, and light industry products.From 1990 to 1999, during the stage of rapid development, Dongguan attracted Taiwanese enterprises that invested in industries such as furniture, plastic products, shoe-making, etc.From 2000 to 2008, Dongguan became a powerhouse. With China's entry into the WTO, large international companies continued to invest in Dongguan. The city established China's largest processing and export base for mechanical, electrical and electronic products, and it gained its reputation as “the factory of the world.”From 2008 to the present, we have witnessed various stages of transformation and upgrading in Dongguan. With rapid urbanization, land in Dongguan became scarce. The improvement of urban living standards and competition in other regions for migrant workers has significantly increased labor costs in Dongguan. Coupled with the global financial crisis, Dongguan's export-oriented economy has been hit hard. The city's industry sector thus began a long march of transformation to reemerge.

Vacating the Cage to Change the Birds (腾笼换鸟)
The export-oriented economic model has made Dongguan a legendary manufacturing center, but it also had obvious shortcomings. As the added value of products through Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) is low, OEMs have limited ability to resist external crises. Manufacturers lack innovation capabilities, and the pace of technological development and upgrading is completely controlled by foreign parties. Many foreign-funded enterprises didn’t want to stay long. They had a tendency to bargain with the local government or landlord once they heard of more preferential policies in other places. Some moved out when their demands weren’t satisfied.
From the perspective of the government, the original economic development model is no longer sustainable. First, after years of development, Dongguan's important comparative advantages of cheap land and cheap labor costs no longer exist. Second, because foreign parties control product pricing, the government does not receive much taxation from foreign-funded enterprises, the input-output ratio of resources like land is low. For example, TTI, the biggest power tool company in the world, has its major manufacturer in Dongguan. TTI Dongguan exported some $2.5 billion products in 2019. However, TTI Dongguan only paid a total tax of 138 million yuan (USD20 million).
The two most important factors in Dongguan’s industrial transformation and upgrading began in 2008:
Transferring traditional labor-intensive industries and high-polluting industries to economically backward areas. In this sense, the city vacated the “cage” and replaced the old birds with new ones – high-tech industries. In cooperation with pollution prevention and control, a number of non-compliant companies have been shut down. As of September 2018, Dongguan has eliminated more than 5,900 “scattered and polluting” companies.Coping with worker shortages and rising wages. There has been a serious drive to automate factory floors. According to the mayor of Dongguan, from September 2014 to the end of 2018, Dongguan integrated a total of 91,000 units (sets) of machines, reduced the number of workers by 280,000, and increased productivity by 2.8 times. By the end of 2018, Dongguan had put 8,000 industrial robots into use.

Phoenix Nirvana - Transforming Data to Results
Despite company dissatisfaction, the perfunctory execution of village and township governments, and the criticism of the Hong Kong media, Dongguan’s industrial transformation has persisted. City government also made adjustments to their initial one-size-fits-all policies to cope with the new reality.
Data shows the at times painful transformation has paid off. Dongguan has prioritized emerging industries: next-generation information technology, high-end equipment and manufacturing, new materials, new energy and life sciences, and biochemical technologies. With these new concentrations, we have seen an improvement in profit and productivity, despite the decline in the city’s share of foreign-invested manufacturers.
The growth rate of Dongguan’s industrial scale and profit has exceeded the growth rate of Dongguan’s GDP during the same period.

The emerging industries represented by communication equipment have achieved tremendous growth, and the upgrading of traditional industries has also achieved noticeable results. In Dongguan, manufacturers that abide by the rules and meet market demands have room for development.

To get a sense of how Dongguan has transformed its industry base in the last decade or more. Compare the city's top industrial sectors in 2004 to those in 2018.

While Dongguan has made tremendous progress in the transformation of its manufacturing industry to date, the task is far from complete. The Development Plan for Key Emerging Industries in Dongguan (2018 – 2025) envisioned that by 2025, the proposed emerging industries would become central to the city’s growth, which it expects to grow at an average annual rate of 18.6 percent or more. With this robust growth, Dongguan will likely secure a new title, one built around advanced manufacturing and global innovation.
