### Being Ambidextrous Leaders and Citizens

19 April 2020|Leadership Development
In 1991, Stanford professor James March publisheda seminal paperon “the relation between the exploration of new possibilities and the exploitation of old certainties in organizational learning.” For business leaders, his research captured a key insight for the balancing or integrating some of the seemingly contradictory learning, knowledge, and other priorities in organizations. Do we allocate talent and financial resources to maintaining our current approach to business and market position, exploiting today? Or do we invest in developing future opportunities, exploring for the future?
Two early proponents of this approach for business management were Michael L. Tushman and Charles A. O’Reilly III, respectively of Harvard and Stanford business schools. InWinning through Innovation(1997), they identified a “success paradox,” which bred an organizational inertia in firms that allowed for success in stable markets but drove failure when markets shifted. Leaders needed to design a “congruent” company system that integrated efficiency and control to provide short-term performance with the autonomy and flexibility to respond to major market changes. Two decades later, inLead and Disrupt(2016), the scholars refined their view of ambidexterity to include both the incremental innovation needed to preserve core markets and the disruptive innovation needed for winning new arenas.
Today, that emphasis on ambidexterity and innovation only grows stronger. Alexander Osterwalder, designer of the Business Model Canvas, and his firm, Strategyzer, have embraced the insight in their recent work. In 2017, recognizing the importance of leadership, Osterwalder proposed that every company should have a “Chief Entrepreneur” in charge of exploration even as a Chief Executive Officer would oversee innovation in existing markets (and both, with equal power, would report to the Chairman of the Board). In their latest book,The Invincible Company(2020), Strategyzer goes further, referring to exploitation and exploration as different business models. The book offers a portfolio map that visualizes a firm’s management of current business models that need to be improved and grownandof future business models that are being searched for and tested.
Ambidexterity has also served to contrast and integrate other dimensions of business and organizational life.Sebastian Raisch and Julian Birkenshaw(2008), for example, used the concept to examine the relationship between a firm’s strategic alignment and efficiency and its ability to adapt to changing conditions. Organizational ambidexterity has been a particularly frequent topic in research abouthuman resourcespractices and HRM system architectures, which often combine different systems to support different business units or environments. More general usage can relate traditional, bureaucratic organizational designs with more open, agile and, presumably, innovative ones. Or the purpose or social impact imperatives of a firm with its priorities for achieving increased profits or market value. Or the ability to operate successfully in different political market systems, say the Chinese and American, simultaneously. If paradoxes are fundamental to organizations, ambidexterity becomes a necessary capability of their leadership.
For years, in my own teaching and coaching, the introduction of ambidexterity to describe the exigency of exploiting existing markets and exploring new ones has provided an “Aha!” moment for many of the leaders I’ve worked with. Yet the fuller value of the idea emerges when we view ambidexterity more broadly, in business and beyond. At the Berlin School of Creative Leadership, a key lesson in the Executive MBA program I used to direct for global leaders concerned the “paradoxes” of creative leadership. That particular orientation was also elaborated elsewhere. In 2006, British researcher Chris Bilton wrote a pioneering book about the creative industries,Management and Creativity, that pivoted on the irresolvable dichotomy between order and chaos captured in its title. Eight years later, Harvard Business School professor Linda A. Hill and colleagues publishedCollective Genius, which argued that the art and practice of leading innovation rest in a series of paradoxes that can summarized under the “master paradox” of “unleash and harness.”
In Berlin, we both teased out a wider range of organizational and leadership oppositionsandlooked more deeply at the relationships between them. This led to our identifying oppositions across the EMBA curriculum that leaders would confront in their work. Explore and Exploit, but also Authenticity and Adaptation, Invention and Implementation, Psychological Safety and Accountability, Purpose and Profit, and Value Creation and Value Capture. Surveying these elements, we realized it was often better and more accurate to describe the relationships as something other than paradoxes. Many were tensions, oppositions, conflicts, contradictions, dualities, or dialectics. While we initially saw a risk in drawing overly fine distinctions between these different kinds of relationships, the creative leaders themselves in the program found the nuances useful in wrestling with the competing values and priorities they faced in their actual decision-making. Not all paradoxes are created equal, we concluded, which also confirmed that ambidexterity was not a one-size-fits-all way of reconciling different elements.
While we initially saw the aggregation of oppositions and the differentiation of terms to describe them as a comparative exercise, we came to realize how the ability to understand the multiple paradoxes more deeply represented a crucial caste of mind for leaders. Around the same time, Tushman and O’Reilly made a similar reference in their later work to the “both/and” thinking that enables ambidexterity. Also in 2016, with Wendy Smith and Marianne Lewis, Tushman offered a focused summary of the value and practice of “Both/And Leadership.” They focused on the opposition of today’s needs and tomorrow’s as innovation paradoxes, global integration and local interests as globalization paradoxes, and social missions and financial pressures as obligation paradoxes. Perhaps most helpfully, Smith, Lewis, and Tushman stressed how the “both/and” mindset could lead differently “by seeing the virtues of inconsistency, recognizing that resources are not always finite, and embracing change rather than chasing stability.”
In today’s unrelenting storm of information, sustaining a “both/and” mindset is arguably more complicated – and valuable – than ever. Holding and weighing two or more contradictory ideas, beliefs or values simultaneously can paralyze decision-making or, as occurs withcognitive dissonance, cause mental discomfort or psychological stress. Even more, a challenge I often encounter with executives is that while they are increasingly familiar with different and opposing ideas, they are less able to analyze and make decisions with them in specific situations. To adapt an older proverb, they are jacks of many trades, familiar with various ideas or models, but masters of none or at most one. As a result, their knowledge is wide but not deep, superficial to the extent they don’t benefit from being able to reconcile or integrate different elements of knowledge. Or, we might say, being able to learn – which recalls March’s original insight about ambidexterity not being about a momentary reconciliation but, rather, a basis of learning.
Today, many of us are working from home or otherwise remotely, under shelter in place, or (as here in France) under lockdown. The impact of COVID-19 has raised far-reaching questions about the future of work, the role of technology in our lives, the global economy, and our prevailing social order. For many, other questions are every bit as far-reaching if much more personal and, literally, closer to home. These have to do with our own priorities and what we are prioritizing and committing to in our lives and communities today. What ambidexterity brings to our reflections on these questions is an insistence on greater context and perspective. While each of us has different specific ideas, beliefs, or values to embrace simultaneously, here are several examples that demonstrate the contemporary necessity – and benefit – of ambidextrous thinking and decision-making.
·  BOTHThe CoronavirusANDBusiness as usual: To what are we allocating our precious individual time, energy, and attention? However much life with COVID-19 may be a “new normal,” what else are we doing or integrating with new demands and routines? As leaders and as citizens. On a current joint project about learning and leadership, for example, I switched from working on a chapter about framing and re-framing to another (seemingly, more timely) about Black Swans, risk-taking, and the move from imagining to making. The aim is to make the project more richly informed by current thinking and analysis and, as a result, more relevant to readers.
·  BOTHCoronavirus knowledge and informationANDEverything else: A crucial subset of managing our time energy, and attention. With our 24/7 social and information feeds, particularly focused on the pandemic, what do we choose as the objects of our attention? For our minds and our hearts? For us as leaders and as citizens and human beings? And when do we switch off? What, then, do we deliberately switch on as alternatives (reading, music, exercise, streaming, new projects, etc.)? Being aware of my habits and tendency to immerse myself in different news feeds if unchecked, for instance, I’ve switched to reading and writing about leading for inclusion and belonging in remote work. I’m also committing to (more) regular podcast listening, meditation, and webinar participation.
·  BOTHSelfANDOthers: Calls for social distancing can emphasize the need for physical distancing but produce social isolation. How do we retain vital social connection and solidarity? Like many others, I’ve greatly increased my screen time, Facetiming friends to share meals, and participating in Zoom social gatherings. I’ve also committed to communicating regularly (with some, daily) with close friends and family. As a leadership coach who already worked virtually, my coaching interactions have increased based on the requests of clients. While mindful of spending too much time with screens, a crucial balance needs to be struck with the need to socialize.
·  BOTHMy BackyardANDSociety/The World: Among the many questions about our connections with others highlighted by this crisis, we need to think not only about social or physical distancing with individuals or small groups but about connections among neighborhoods, cities, and nations. At the national and international levels, the lack of political coordination has ranged from lacking to absent. In my current conversations with colleagues and executives, the failures of leadership communication, decision-making, and error-management seem frequently disappointing and sometimes appalling. While tending to our own gardens, each of us can nevertheless use the Coronavirus as an opportunity to emphasize our connectedness and shared humanity by communicating more with faraway friends, exercising humility and openness, and learning more about other people and places.
·  BOTHNetworksANDCommunity: The very nature of the pandemic – and of contagion – casts light on how connectedness can be both productive and risky. While still too early to draw wider conclusions, it appears worth stepping back to gain diverse perspectives and learn more about the ramifications of globalized economic and talent markets, technology systems, and telecommunication networks. In fact, more systems-based approaches to the complexity of our global, regional and local economic and social lives – from supply chains and trade, investment, and production networks to social media and digital or physical communities – seem to be a promising direction for developing better leadership in the future.
·  BOTHIndividual CitizensANDthe Surveillance State: In a popular essay written early in the European spread of COVID-19, historianYuval Noah Harariidentified these tensions between the empowerment of human individuals and communities and the increased state monitoring of people’s behaviors online and in the physical world. The latter state action typically relies on technologies, many corporate, that commodify personal information. (Commentator Azeem Azahr referred to this “key cleavage,” separately, as “Liberty and Leviathan.”) Yet the question of whether we should use surveillance technologies to monitor compliance with social distancing to reduce the spread of the Coronavirus – presumably a social good – shows that even this example becomes one for us to pursue, as leaders and as citizens, less with either/or than with both/and thinking.
