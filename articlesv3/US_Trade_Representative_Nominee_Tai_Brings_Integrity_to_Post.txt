AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. We have written extensively aboutU.S.-China trade relations, for examplehere, andhere. In this post, we seek to continue our discussion of U.S.-China trade relations and how they will evolve under the Biden Presidency. – The Editorial Team

President-elect Joseph Biden’s selection of Katherine Tai to serve as the U. S. Trade Representative (USTR) sparked a tsunami of speculation in China, most publicly on social media as netizens speculated that she could have an anti-China bent given her background and experience. However, we think she is well-positioned to think deeply and carefully about how trade can advance U.S.-China relations.

“Trade is like any other tool in our domestic or foreign policy,” Tai said when her nomination was announced. “It is not an end in itself. It is a means to create more hope and opportunity for people.”
We understand the concerns those in China might have with a Taiwanese American taking on such a prominent trade role. Already there is conjecture about where her loyalties will lie. To avoid looking compromised, will she be tough on China to prove her allegiances? Or will she be secretly fighting to harm China to advance Taiwan?
What this early guesswork misses is that Tai is first and foremost an expert negotiator and trusted confidante of the new president of the United States, no matter her background. And, yes, she is first and foremost an American, born and raised in the United States. But more importantly, Tai also is more technocrat than politician. And we mean technocrat in the most positive sense of the word. She is not a politician and she does not have a political axe to grind. She is a technical expert in an area that is crucial for the U.S. government and U.S.-China relations. (What a relief.) She formerly served as the China enforcement chief for the USTR during the Obama administration, and she worked on the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement from her role as the senior trade lawyer on the U.S. House Ways and Means Committee.

“As the United States seeks to repair strained relationships with our partners around the world and address increasingly perilous challenges from China, Katherine will be an honorable and effective representative for this nation, our people, and our interests,” Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal, D-Mass., noted in a press release.
Naturally, she has a long track record of fighting for U.S. interests globally, and she definitely has been tough on China in a number of areas. She most likely would use international alliances and World Trade Organization (WTO) rules to deal with unfair trade practices. Between 2007 and 2014, she represented the U.S. in disputes against China at the WTO.
Along with her time at the USTR, Tai’s career includes stints at a number of respected international law firms, including Baker & McKenzie and Miller & Chevalier. Born in Connecticut, she is a graduate of Yale University and Harvard Law School. Tai also taught university English for two years in Guangzhou, China.
Tai is not expected to continue the practices of current trade czar Robert Lighthizer, who has overseen the imposition of $370 billion in import duties on goods imported from China. Tai called the tariffs a “defensive” maneuver during a webinar in August hosted by the Center for American Progress. She said it was critical to employ offensive measures to balance and counter China.
“The offense has got to be about what we're going to do is make ourselves and our workers and our industries and our allies faster, nimbler, be able to jump higher, be able to compete stronger and ultimately be able to defend this open democratic way of life that we have,” she said at the webinar. “It is about more than just economics and economic power.”
Many Chinese netizens appear to have realized that Chinese Americans are first Americans. As Americans, of course they should serve the interests of America. Even though Tai is not expected to be a Panda Hugger, the Chinese cannot accept the prospect that an ethnic Chinese could publicly challenge China. In fact, their fears seem inflamed by the fact that Tai, who speaks Mandarin, will be even less trusted and effective than Lighthizer who has been reviled for his attitudes about China.
Many experts have predicted that trade with China is not among the areas where America and China can cooperate immediately after the inauguration of the new president. Biden has signaled as much in post-election conversations about removing tariffs against China, which he doesn’t plan to do immediately. We believe that the first six months of the new administration will be focused on the pandemic and economic revival.
Tai and her diplomatic counterparts will be spending the first few months rebuilding bridges with allies, which have been torn down under the Trump administration. At the operational level, she can use her time to make technical preparations for restarting the negotiations, and work with the Chinese to clarify some key facts such as results of the phase one agreement, the real impact of the trade war on U.S. and China, and whether the bottom lines of each country have been served by this conflict. More importantly, she must work to reach consensus on the direction of trade with China within the new administration. In this way, once a window is opened, two countries can immediately start the negotiation. Time is important to the Biden administration.
Already, China has laid out a strategy called "dual circulation", indicating an accelerated shift of attention from an export-oriented economy to a domestic consumption-driven economy. The year 2021 is of special importance to China: the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party and the beginning of China's 14th Five-Year Plan. Under such circumstances, the Chinese authority certainly doesn’t want a further decline in the U.S.-China relationship, but it will not make too many concessions to the U.S. All in all, it will be a fine line for Tai to walk.
What Tai and the Biden administration are facing is how to maintain a productive if vigilant relationship with China, the rising superpower, while also advocating for the best interests of the United States. After the Communist Party took power in 1949, the official dialogue between the two countries was interrupted for some 25 years. The result during that period was the U.S. and China were involved in two regional military conflicts in Korea and Vietnam, paying even heavier prices than either country wanted.
Our hope is that U.S.-China relations have found another transition. We don’t know what Biden and Tai will do and what they can achieve, but when cyber space is full of nationalism and populism, the stage is set for a rocky road ahead. We believe Tai is up to the challenge, including convincing China she is a tempered and judicious adversary. She will bring rationality to U.S. trade policy, and she hopefully will turn Donald Trump's zero-sum trade policy into a win-win for America and China. We wish her the best of luck.
