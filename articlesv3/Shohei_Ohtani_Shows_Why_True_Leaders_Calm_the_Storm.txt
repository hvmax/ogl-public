AtOn Global Leadership, we have developed a new theory of leadership that steers away from the C-Suite, the charismatic leader approach to leading. Instead, we focus on what people do as leaders in their lives on a daily basis – every day everyone a leader.This post offers an example of such vital Everyday Leadership on the field, and in the person of San Diego Padres pitcher Shohei Ohtani who proves sportsmanship and leadership are a rare combination.
There’s a moment in baseball when the roar of 50,000 fans fades, fists clench, and the game teeters on the edge of chaos. It’s in these seconds when benches clear and tempers boil that true leadership steps forward.
On June 19, 2025, in a tense Los Angeles Dodgers–San Diego Padres clash, pitching superstar Shohei Ohtani delivered a masterclass in precisely that.
The game was already smoldering. Earlier, a fastball from Dodgers rookie Jack Little plunked Fernando Tatis Jr., triggering a benches-clearing scene. Emotions were raw, umpires were issuing warnings, and the crowd buzzed with the kind of energy that precedes an all-out brawl. In fact, the two managers were ejected from the game.
Padres reliever Robert Suárez unleashed a 100-mph fastball that drilled Shohei Ohtani in the June 19 game between the Dodgers and the Padres.

Then came the bottom of the ninth. Padres reliever Robert Suárez unleashed a 100-mph fastball that drilled Ohtani. The stadium inhaled. Cameras panned to the Dodgers dugout, where his teammates were already climbing the fence and poised to storm the field.
And that’s when Ohtani raised his hand.
He waved them off.
In that single gesture, which was firm, cool, almost serene, he turned the volume down on a potential powder keg.

Ohtani didn’t just absorb the pain of a 100-mph heater; he absorbed the fury and tension of an entire game, an entire rivalry, and told his teammates:“Not now. We’re bigger than this.”
That’s leadership, Everyday Leadership.
Leadership is not about the position you are in or the number of followers you have; it is about the decisions you take every day to make the people and the world around you a little better. It could be the entry-level member of a team or it could be a superstar who is working diligently to help his team achieve its goals.
It’s easy to think of leadership in baseball as the stuff of fire-and-brimstone speeches, chest-thumping celebrations, or highlight-reel heroics. And Ohtani certainly delivers those, too. His two-way brilliance has made him the face of the sport. But on that Thursday night, his most powerful act was restraint.
He showed that leaders protect their team not only by hitting towering home runs but by keeping their teammates out of harm’s way. He recognized that a fight wouldn’t help the Dodgers’ chances of winning the division, or of staying healthy for the long grind ahead.
And perhaps most impressively, he made it look effortless.
Ohtani didn’t yell. He didn’t scold. He simply raised his hand. And a dugout full of fired-up Dodgers listened. That’s the respect he commands, not just as a talent, but as a steadying force in a sport prone to drama.
In an era where athletes are scrutinized for every reaction, Ohtani offered a different model: lead by example, even when your body is bruised and your pride is tested.
Some players become legends because of their stats. Ohtani’s numbers already place him in rarefied air. But moments like these where he displays quiet, decisive leadership are what will make him remembered not just as a superstar, but as a leader who knew how to calm the storm.
And in baseball, as in life, that’s the kind of leader every team hopes to have.
