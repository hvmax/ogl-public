### How a City of 9 Million People Controlled COVID-19's Spread

AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy and, in particular, life in China. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. We are also building a database of cities in China. Our in-depth research focuses on places that are crucial to Chinese economic development but are off the beaten path, far from where most foreign investors congregate (i.e., Shanghai, Beijing, Shenzhen, Guangzhou). One of the cities in our data set is Wenzhou, an important city in Zhejiang Province. As it happens, Wenzhou did very well in quickly flattening the curve in the COVID-19 pandemic.

Three months ago, the City of Wenzhou (温州) in Zhejiang province was considered high-risk for the coronavirus, with a total of  500 COVID-19 cases, the second highest behind the epicenter of the crisis in the City of Wuhan. Today, life is back to normal and Wenzhou is considered at low risk. It took the city 40 days to go from adopting stringent control measures to declaring victory on March 2.

How did this city of 9.3 million people in Southeast China do it? We have compiled a timeline that reveals the development of the epidemic, control measures, and recovery steps of Wenzhou. Though every city is different, we believe what happened in Wenzhou can provide some reference for people who are still fighting the virus and hoping to return to normal.
Let's talk about Wenzhou. This port city has as population in size similar to the State of New Jersey, but it has half the land mass. People in Wenzhou are considered the shrewdest business people in China, especially with its prowess in global manufacturing and commerce. The city government there has been viewed as open minded and pro-business.
Based on the development of the epidemic, contain and control, and recovery, the timeline breaks down into four stages:
Stage 1. Development (Jan. 4 to Jan. 22, 2020)
The first case in Wenzhou was announced on Jan. 21. From official media, the patient was a Wenzhou resident who was doing business in Wuhan. He drove back home on Jan. 3 and went to see a doctor on Jan. 4 for fever. He was hospitalized as an infectious disease patient on Jan. 17. On Jan. 20, the nucleic acid re-test in the China CDC in Beijing was positive, same as the previous results done in Zhejiang province.

Wenzhou announced the CDC hotline on Jan. 21 and opened 33 fever clinics in the city on Jan. 22. Few people took it seriously, though. In Jan. 23 newspapers, one can still see people celebrating the Spring Festival and preparing for the most important holiday.
Stage 2. Control (Jan. 23 to Feb. 15)
Everything changed in Wenzhou when people woke up in the morning of Jan. 23. At midnight, the lock down of Wuhan was announced. The Zhejiang provincial government held a meeting with top leaders of the cities within the province. On that last working day before Spring Festival, the battle plan against the epidemic was assigned. After the meeting, Zhejiang initiated the highest alert, the Level-1 response to major public health emergencies, which allowed the local government to mobilize and take all necessary control measures.
Wuhan city moved to Level-1 response on Jan. 24, a day after Zhejiang.
The first set of control measures started on Jan. 24. Among all these measures, the most painful decisions were cancelling banquets, tourism, and hotel bookings, as well as closing temples. They also sought to identify people from Hubei province and implement close contact tracing—the most important tasks during this stage. By Jan. 27, the city has located 26,300 people who traveled to the city from Hubei.
The second set of measures came out on Jan. 29 and were implemented on Jan. 30. The measures included shutting down all public transportation, and closing 46 of 55 highway toll stations.

Starting Feb. 2, each family could only have one person leave their houses for daily supplies for two days for every week. This type of house control was extended one more week until Feb. 15. (Many people living in Shanghai considered these measures extreme when they heard about them and would never accept them.)
The number of newly confirmed cases reached 55 on Jan. 30. Gradually, COVID-19 cases dropped below 10 after Feb. 10. The tracing of close contacts had exceeded 10,000.
Stage 3. Recovery (February 16 – March 2)
The daily roll call of new cases descended into the single digits, and the city’s Health QR Code system was launched. This gave the government confidence to resume the normal order of life and business, though in a very cautious way. On Feb. 21, recreational parks started to re-open. On Feb. 22, all check points at highways and roads inside the city were removed. On Feb.24, all hospitals resumed outpatient services. The local government chartered special buses, trains, and even airplanes to bring migrant workers back to Wenzhou.
On March 2, the Wenzhou government announced a “period victory” as there were no new cases reported in the city for 13 consecutive days.
Stage 4. New normal (After March 2)
Though the pandemic overseas is getting worse, Wenzhou is not on the front lines any more. then on April 12, there were 12 cases identified, likely imported from overseas and the city traced several hundred close contacts.
Schools started to gradually reopen beginning April 13. On April 26, all students from first to 12th grade were back to school. University students were allowed to go back from April 26 as well, though their new semester began in May.
Looking back, the Wenzhou health authority claimed that people gathering together had resulted in more than half of the city’s total cases. At-home isolation was the simplest, most effective way to cut off the transmission of the virus. Health officials didn’t mention masks because wearing a mask is commonplace and not an issue in Wenzhou. People cooperated in those extremely strict control measures and helped to flatten the curve.
From this point on, living with the virus will be the new norm until a COVID-19 vaccine is developed and widely distributed.
