### Zhengzhou: A Story of Local Economic Development

26 October 2020|China, Economic Development, Local Government
AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy and, in particular, life in China. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. We have sought to advance a conversation about the U.S.-China relationship, and a deep understanding of local economic development in China. We have written a series about the strategic strength oflocal economic development in China’s 2nd and 3rd tier citiesandentrepreneurship in China todayas well as a series aboutChina’s Belt and Road Initiative. More recently, we have been writing about the U.S.-China Trade War as it relates toinnovation in the Chinese economy. This post adds to that conversation. – The Editorial Team

In anearlier post, we described economic development in China this way: “Economic development in China is fundamentally shaped by government guidance and centralized control. There is a lot of strategic planning going on in five-year plans, 10-year plans, and 20-year plans… While we often think of the Chinese government as an authoritarian, protectionist, and centralized party in Beijing, that is only one side of the government. In reality, local governments are the engines driving China’s growth. Indeed, the Chinese government is an extremely decentralized and entrepreneurial system of district and township governments. The mayors of China’s districts, townships, and villages behave like corporate CEOs, focusing on Key Performance Indicators (KPIs),pursuing foreign investment, and advancing their own careers through the financial and economic achievements in their districts and townships… But local governments don’t do it alone. They do it through close coordination with China’s private sector and withforeign investors from abroad.”
The Rise of Zhengzhou
On May 25, 2017, Zhengzhou made the transition from the solid ground of Tier 2 Chinese city to the hallowed land of Tier 1. In China, cities are ranked based on several criteria that place them into Tiers 1-6. While the Chinese Government releases no specific data on how cities are ranked, the financial magazine, Yicai Global, tracks these rankings and assesses them based on GDP, per capita GDP, commercial resources and the extent to which a city serves as a commercial hub, administrative level, and commercial dynamism. As of 2017, Zhengzhou now sits in this category of the top cities in China. But how did it get there?
On March 28, 2012, Tim Cook visited an iPhone production plant in Zhengzhou (郑州) City on his first trip to China as the CEO of Apple. When Reuters reported this news, they mistakenly placed Zhengzhou in Hebei Province (河北) and had to correct this several months later as Zhengzhou is actually in Henan Province (河南). Before its investment in Zhengzhou, Foxconn had invested in 22 cities in mainland China, including 12 factories. How did Zhengzhou as a late arrival to this party become a leading player in this important industry?

Foxconn is the world’s largest provider of electronics manufacturing services and Apple’s biggest contract manufacturer. Foxconn’s investment in mainland China began in Shenzhen (深圳) in 1988. Before the Zhengzhou plant was completed, Shenzhen had been Foxconn’s largest production base, and currently, Shenzhen still retains Foxconn’s China headquarters and R&D center.
Around 2008, the relationship between Shenzhen and Foxconn began to weaken. Shenzhen’s rising wages were eroding Foxconn’s profits; a series of employee suicides occurred at the Foxconn factory in Shenzhen; under the pressure of the financial crisis, Foxconn was criticized for having a tax contribution significantly lower than the industry average; Shenzhen’s new favorites were companies like Huawei and BYD, generating higher output per area unit. Although the Shenzhen government was still working with Foxconn, anyone with a discerning eye could see that Foxconn’s life in Shenzhen was becoming difficult.
Henan Province started courting Foxconn as early as 2007, under the leadership of a task force lead by the mayor of Zhengzhou. However, Foxconn did not show much interest in Zhengzhou at the time. Early reports revealed that the company’s initial impression of Henan was not good: a poor province that supplied lots of migrant workers, but little more. After 2008, Foxconn’s founder and CEO, Terry Gou, and finally made up his mind to begin to move Foxconn’s production base inland.
Foxconn searched widely, negotiating with local governments one after another, intentionally or unintentionally creating a situation of “too many monks and too little gruel.” Gou, who had been somewhat embarrassed by the negative press in Shenzhen, became a key protagonist in inland provinces – cities that entered his vision were Chengdu (成都) in Sichuan (四川), Taiyuan (太原) in Shanxi (山西), Wuhan (武汉) in Hubei (湖北), Zhengzhou in Henan, and Chongqing (重庆) and Tianjin (天津), which are both provincial-level cities.
At the time, Foxconn seemed to prefer Tianjin, and Zhengzhou was viewed as a backup. Zhengzhou finally won the competition because of its lower overall costs, which is critical to the electronics contract manufacturing industry where gross profit margins usually hover around 10%. Zhengzhou is located in Henan Province. Henan has a population of over 100 million people and a large supply of low-cost labor. In 2010, Foxconn had 800,000 employees in mainland China, nearly one-fifth were from Henan. Zhengzhou is the largest transportation hub in China, with high-speed rail lines running in eight directions. Starting from Zhengzhou Airport, a 1.5-hour flight can cover two-thirds of major cities and three-fifths of the population inChina. The introduction of Foxconn became a governor’s project, Henan Province gave Foxconn favorable conditions in terms of government co-investment, cheap land and tax incentives. Though never revealed, it is estimated that it cost Henan about ￥12 to 15 billion or $1.8-2.3 billion for Foxconn’s Zhengzhou project.
In the project contract signed at the beginning of July 2010, Foxconn proposed a stringent schedule to test the execution capability of the Zhengzhou government. The Foxconn factory is inZhengzhou Airport Economic Zone. A state-owned construction company in Zhengzhou arranged 2,000 workers to work in three shifts 24x7, the renovation of standard factory buildings of 62,500 square meters was completed in less than a month. Because available plant area was not big enough, a textile company that had been in the Zone for a long time was “persuaded” to move out immediately by the Zone management.The special cables and air compressors required by Foxconn’s plant were not available in the market, the government therefore stopped subway construction in Zhengzhou and transferred same equipments and products to ensure Foxconn’s needs. On August 2, Zhengzhou Foxconn officially went into production. It took only one month from initial investment agreement to the landing of the first batch of parts.
This is Zhengzhou speed. Since mid-September, more than 6,000 construction workers had been working day and night on a large construction site in Zhengzhou Airport Economic Zone, 5 kilometers north of the airport runway. The 12-month project was completed in four months. At the end of 2010, a state-of-the-art factory building with a total construction area of 600,000 square meters was completed. Then, a labor army 100,000 strong, recruited with the support of the government, joined assembly lines in the new factory, where popular iPhones went through final assembly and then shipped to all parts of the world by air.The mega plant of Zhengzhou Foxconn now has over 200,000 employees, hosts over 90 production lines, and conducts final assembly for about half of the world’s iPhones.
What Does Zhengzhou Foxconn Bring?
The Foxconn project has brought Henan Province electronic communication equipments manufacturing industry, a new industry to the Province with annual sales that now exceeds ￥300 billion. The project has brought Zhengzhou a new title – iPhone city. Before Foxconn landed in Zhengzhou, Henan hardly produced mobile phones. In 2014, Zhengzhou Foxconn exported 72.12 million mobile phones with a value of ￥127.6 billion or $20.7 billion, making it China’s largest export company. In 2016, the number of mobile phones made in Henan reached 259.2 million, of which 257.5 million were produced in Zhengzhou. In the same year, the output of non-Apple mobile phones surpassed Apple mobile phones for the first time. Foxconn now has factories in 8 cities in Henan Province, most of which are business units supportingZhengzhou Foxconn.
In addition to economic benefits, Foxconn has also produced tremendous social value. Foxconn has exerted a subtle influence on Henan, a large agricultural and populous province with an urbanization level of only 40% ten years ago. Most of Zhengzhou Foxconn’s employees are migrant workers, and their lives have been changed by Apple and Foxconn. After being baptized by local urbanization and modern assembly lines, they have promoted the urbanization and industrialization of Henan Province.
Although Foxconn has increased Zhengzhou’s exports by many folds, its contribution to Zhengzhou’s GDP may be lower than you imagine. It is estimated that Foxconn adds about ￥30 billion GDP to Zhengzhou, less than 3% of Zhengzhou’s total GDP. Foxconn has contributed more than ￥100 billion GDP to Henan, while the province’s total GDP exceeds￥5.4 trillion in 2019. Is Foxconn important to Zhengzhou? Very important. While it might be a stretch to say that, without Foxconn, Zhengzhou’s economy would collapse, but there is little doubt that the economy has transformed in fundamental ways through this relationship.
Migrant Workers: The “Floating Population” Become Residents
There is another part of this s tory that has to do with labor. In China's powerful manufacturing economy, one of the critical forces is the massive migrant labor force, about 250 million people moving around the country providing a "seasonal" labor force spread across China's integrated supply chain. For years, the so-called floating population (流动人口) has fueled the Chinese manufacturing miracle. But, in some ways, they have also been second class citizens of sorts because of China's household passport (户口) laws. The interesting thing to consider here is how Zhengzhou has dealt with this population in the years since Foxconn started making iPhones in Zhengzhou in 2010. With this influx of workers, Zhengzhou would be transformed into Apple City. As noted above, in Zhengzhou, Foxconn has built more than 4 million square meters of factory buildings, more than 2.5 million square meters of blue-collar apartments, and employed more than 200,000 people. Most of Zhengzhou Foxconn's employees are migrant workers. Their lives have been dramatically changed by Apple and Foxconn.
First, Foxconn provides a legal and stable employment environment. Foxconn signs labor contracts, pays salaries in full and on time, pays social insurance and housing funds, and conducts regular occupational health checks. Working at Foxconn, many migrant workers have achieved stable employment for the first time after entering the city, and, for many, it is their first formal job in their lives.
Second, stable income provides the material basis for migrant workers to live in the city, support their basic living and consumptions. At Foxconn, the average income of migrant workers is basically the same as the average annual salary income of local urban private sector employees. In 2019, the average salary of employed persons in urban private units in Zhengzhou was ￥51357 or $7,445.
Third, the living facilities and working environment provided by Foxconn help migrant workers to form urbanized living habits. Blue-collar apartments provide air-conditioning, water heaters, separate bathrooms and 3rd party property management; migrant workers from different places communicate in Mandarin instead of dialects; whether they work or go out, they must follow the instructions and the guidelines of public signals.
All of these dynamics help migrant workers to integrate into urban life in terms of employment, adaptation, cultural and psychological recognition. When the household registration system reform enables migrant workers to have a household passport (hukou, 户口) in the city where they live, it is natural for migrant laborers to become true urban residents. Generally speaking, based on our research, more and more Zhengzhou Foxconn migrant workers have adapted to urban life and want to stay longer if possible. Some migrant workers have bought housing in Zhengzhou; some children of migrant workers are studying in schools near the factory. The urbanization of migrant workers is a crucial part of China's urbanization strategy and an important way to increase the residential consumption in the city where they are located.
Public Private Partnerships and the Rise of First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University
First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University (ZDYFY) is a public Grade A Class III (三级甲等)hospital located in Zhengzhou. Before 2008, there were fewer than 2,000 beds in ZDYFY. By 2017, the total number of beds reached 10,000, and ZDYFY has adopted the nickname of “The Largest Hospital in the Universe.” In 2018, ZDYFY had 7.76 million outpatient visits and completed 350,000 surgeries, both ranking No. 1 among hospitals in China.

Rural patients account for 70% of the total number of outpatients and inpatients in ZDYFY. In China, medical services have long enjoyed a notorious reputation: difficult and expensive (看病贵看病难)but people feel much better at ZDYFY compared to other hospitals. How has ZDYFY made such changes?
In 2008, Henan Province launched the New Rural Cooperative Medical System (新型农村合作医疗 or NRCMS). 72.03 million agricultural population in Henan participated NRCMS, the participants can immediately enjoy reimbursement of medical services within the province. ZDYFY was more keenly aware of the opportunities brought by NRCMS than other hospitals, it immediately invested in equipment and rapidly expanded its capacity. At the same time, internal reforms were implemented to encourage doctors to treat more patients, e.g. there is no registration number limits, most medical tests and exams can be done within one day. For beds a patient has to wait one week or longer in other hospitals in Zhengzhou, ZDYFY can provide within two days. The hospital has no restrictions on extra beds (加床), as long as there is space, extra beds can be added. The hospital also provides subsidies to further reduce financial burden of patients. For example, there is a time when the personal accountability is less than ￥10,000 after NRCMS reimbursement, the hospital will completely exempt this portion.
ZDYFY is very creative in attracting patients. As other provinces in China, best hospitals in Henan are in capital city. People don't trust local township hospitals and tend to go to big hospitals. People in Henan have the characteristics of believing in acquaintances, ZDYFY thus carries out “Experts and Professors’ Hometown Tour” activity, sending senior doctors to return to their hometowns for volunteer medical consultation. After seeing the expertise of townsman from the best hospital in the province, ZDYFY will come out first for neighbors for medical services. For county hospitals lacking expertise, funding and attention, ZDYFY assigns some department directors to become pluralism deputy dean, makes invests in facility and equipment from time to time, and absorbs the expense of training and payroll for some local doctors. The doctors in county hospitals are flattered and willing to refer patients to ZDYFY. When patients from counties need to be hospitalized, a department ZDYFY will contact local NRCMS to help patient to get medical insurance reimbursement. As long as the expenses are affordable, patients and their relatives would prefer a large hospital if the process is not that complicated. ZDYFY is very attractive to rural patients - the best hospital in the province, you get treated when you come.
ZDYFY’s corporate operation has brought many benefits. Before 2014, 400,000 Henan people went out province for medical treatment every year, but the number was reduced to 100,000 after 2015. In 2017, ZDYFY’s revenue exceeded ￥10 billion, 4 billion more than the second-ranked hospital in the province. Ten years ago, the revenue gap between the two hospitals was ￥60 million.
Among China’s 1.4 billion citizens, there are more than 400 million people in the middle- and higher-income groups. These people in larger cities and wealthier regions are getting a lot of attention. However, we should not ignore the remaining 1 billion people, as they also contribute tremendously to the massive consumption economy. The success story of ZDYFY vividly reveals their consumption power and the direct benefits to an organization.
Can Zhengzhou’s Success be Replicated?
So where is the next Zhengzhou? A city with convenient transportation, a large agricultural population nearby and a government that is able and willing to provide huge subsidies. Foxconn invested in Taiyuan in 2004 and Chengdu in 2009, the governments of these cities have shown the same enthusiasm and support as Zhengzhou. But now when talking about Foxconn’s development in inland China, Zhengzhou seems to be the only city people know about.
Nevertheless, this is more broadly a story of local economic development in China. The Zhengzhou government has done an exceptional job of attracting foreign capital, building a manufacturing ecosystem, weaving together public services for new residents through public-private partnerships. The Zhengzhou Foxconn project is a win-win – Foxconn has made Zhengzhou successful and vice versa. The project of Apple and iPhone City in Zhengzhou has been a key part of the growth of Zhengzhou as an economic center of China. But this has been a broadly defined effort of transformation by an entrepreneurial local government. We have seen this in China before, and Zhengzhou is but one of many examples of local economic development. This is the story of entrepreneurial municipal and provincial governments, competition over and partnerships with powerful foreign investors, public-private partnerships, and the dynamic use of a powerful migrant labor force. It is the story of the rise of a new Tier 1 Chinese city.
