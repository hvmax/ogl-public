On Global Leadership's regular feature, OGL Real Time, presents our up-to-the-minute insights on current news and events. We hope these breaking news insights from our OGL team members will help illuminate the events of the day and provide the depth needed to understand global political, economic and cultural transitions and transformations. In this post, we examine U.S.-China relations in recent history and how moves by both the United States and China have created schisms between the two countries. This Real Time Q&A considers those recent activities and attitudes and their impact.
From the OGL Team
China has been in the news a lot these last two weeks, mostly about its economy but also about its activities on the world stage through the BRICS meeting. We thought we’d give some context to these events with our latest Real Time.
1. Question: Is China’s economy in serious trouble right now, as many western media outlets suggest?
Answer: The short answer is no, China’s economy is not in “serious” trouble right now. The Western media drumbeat about this is partly China bashing and partly derived from a misunderstanding of economic development and growth. To put things in context: First, the fact that China might miss its projected 5.5% growth rate is not a tragedy. In 2022, among the world’s largest economies, China, 3.0, had a higher growth rate than the US, 2.1, Germany, 1.8, and Japan, 1.1. In the first half of 2023, the world’s largest economies saw growth rates of US, 1.8, China, 5.2, Germany, -.3, Japan, 1.4, UK, .4, and India, 6.1. So, on a very basic level, the fact that China might miss its target of 5.5% is not a crisis for an economy its size and at its stage of development. India will beat it, but among every other top economy in the world, China’s rate will be more than double that of any other.
Some reporters have suggested that China may be “settling” into growth rates in the 3-5% range. As one reporter we spoke withrecently put itabout China, “The world has gotten used to double digit growth… What’s going on?”
Here we would simply add that this “settling in” to lower growth rates is an inevitability of healthy economic development and growth. In some ways, China has become a victim of its own success: prior to China’s economic transformation, it would have been unheard of for a country China’s size to maintain double-digit growth rates for more than a decade (which China did throughout the 1990s and early 2000s).
More than this, the process of sustained economic growth comprises a complex set of issues with many variables in play. Put simply: when small agrarian economies embark on a path to building a solid manufacturing economy, there is significant room for rapid growth. A large, low-cost labor force, state-led investment in building an industrial infrastructure, the attraction of customers and foreign capital, all can lead to rapid growth in the economy. China embarked on this path and managed this transition in a way we have never seen in modern times. However, inevitably, as the infrastructure solidifies, as competition grows in the region, and, in very basic mathematical terms, as the size of the economy grows, the rate of growth will inevitably diminish.
Now, there are of course significant problems in China’s economy today, as there are in the US and, more generally, the global economic system. Any time an economy experiences an exogenous shock, growth rates are at risk. Such shocks could include a global pandemic, sudden tariffs imposed by a major trading partner, sudden regulation disallowing certain trading partners to have access to specific technologies, and many other forces that effect economic activity and global trade. China has experienced all of these – some of them at the hands of their largest trading partner, the United States – and many more. However, over the last four decades, the government has effectively managed the steady growth of the economy. As we have described elsewhere (see, e.g.,herehereandhere), foreign companies are so deeply embedded in China’s manufacturing supply chain that we believe the economy will continue to grow at a steady rate. Indeed, our prediction is that China is still firmly on track to take the position as the world’s largest economy by 2035.
So, quick summary: we believe the Western media is overstating the concerns here. China will continue to manage the economic development and transformation process, and we will continue to see strong economic growth.
2. Question: It now doesn’t look like China will meet its revised 5% economic growth target for 2023. What are the factors slowing its growth and how long-lasting will they be?
Answer: The consensus expectation about China is after three years of strict “zero-COVID” policy, China’s economy would quickly recover in 2023. So after receiving better than expected first quarter results, the investment banks mostly raised their forecasts higher. Entering the second quarter, property recovery faltered and some major real estate developers like Evergrande and Country Garden are in serious trouble. Exports and imports also declined the most in three years due to cooling demand at home and abroad. In July, total retail sales of consumer goods grew at a disappointing 2.5%. Contrary to the sluggish sales of physical goods is the boom in service consumption, especially in tourism and film markets, but this seem to have been neglected by analysts.
In short, China’s economy is facing new difficulties and challenges but we are not anticipating a Lehman moment. As for how long such “waves and setbacks” will last, it depends on how Beijing effectively promotes its new development model, upgrades its industry structure and makes progress in R&D. A short term indicator is China’s stock market, which seems to be low-hanging fruit and a gauge on people’s confidence level.
3. Question: What are the implications for President Xi Jinping if growth rates aren’t met over time? Does it impact his credibility as a good leader with China’s people?
Answer: We are in a time that many major global economies are encountering various degrees of economic and social challenges. For China, the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee attributes the difficulties and challenges facing China’s economy to insufficient domestic demand, difficulties in the operation of some enterprises, risks and hidden dangers in key areas, as well as a grim and complex external environment. But we don’t see the current situation in the Chinese economy as one that has gone so bad that it has affected the lives of the majority of people. Actually, the GDP growth rate isn’t a focus on social media, especially when the major scenic spots across the country are overcrowded this summer. Having this said, the weak economy is China’s biggest challenge today. Whether the Chinese leader can maneuver through the current trend is obviously the most important aspect of the public opinion in China. Otherwise we will hear a lot of blame about the externality, but the expectation will be buried.
4. Question: Youth unemployment reached a record 21.3 percent in June. What are the implications for China’s economy and workforce?
Answer: The National Bureau of Statistics of China (NBSC) released in July that the unemployment rate for 16-24 year olds reached 21.3% in June. This indicator has continued to rise since January 2023 and has reached its highest since January 2018. The unwise decision of NBSC to suspend the release of youth unemployment data on August 15th has caused public concern and criticism. The high youth unemployment rate can be attributed mainly to the following reasons:
First, economic reasons - China’s economy is still recovering, the number of start-ups is declining, and existing companies are cautious about expanding, thus there are naturally fewer jobs opportunities for young people than in the past. Changes in industry-specific policies, such as education and training industry, real estate industry, governance and regulatory in internet platforms, have had big impact on employment in their industries, and these industries used to employ a large number of college graduates. While the application of digital technologies such as AI has increased productivity, it has also reduced the demand for white-collar jobs that young people are keen on.
Second, mismatched talents between supply and demand - The difficulty of youth employment is highlighted by the employment of fresh college graduates, but such phenomenon is not unique to China. Compared with employers’ requirements, the graduates often do not have the advantage in skills. At the same time, some fresh college graduates have a biased concept for their market worth and skill requirements, and have set exorbitant expectations.
Third, the exacerbation of excessive expansion of university enrollment - According to China’s Ministry of Education, the number of graduates from Chinese universities reaches a record high of 11.58 million in 2023. In 2022, Chinese universities added 10.15 million new junior college students, 1.1million master’s students, and 139,000 doctoral students. Beijing along, the data released by the Beijing Municipal Education Commission, in 2023, there will be about 160,800 master’s and doctoral graduates in Beijing’s universities, but about 136,100 undergraduate graduates. The large increase of graduates has clearly exceeded the current level of high-tech, high-value-added, high-paid jobs that the Chinese economy can provide. The current high youth unemployment rate is actually paying for the massive expansion of the university enrollment in the previous years.
The issue of employment is essentially both an economic issue and a social one. To effectively solve this problem is necessary to develop new economic streams and create job demand in service sectors that suitable for high-level talents. At the same time, to control the expansion of higher education enrollments, especially the number of master’s and doctoral students. Delaying the occurrence of the problem cannot fundamentally solve it.
5. Question: What is China’s strategy with the BRICS Group and why is it a China victory for the BRICS Group to be expanded?
Answer: The BRICS expansion agenda is undoubtedly a victory for China. The history of the BRICS group is well documented, so we won’t go deep into this history here. But suffice to say, BRICs, Brazil, Russia, India, and China, originally identified in 2001 (and then BRICS, with the 2010 addition of South Africa) by Goldman Sachs economist Jim O’Neill, pointing to the block of nations that would dominate the global economy by 2050. Channelling O’Neill’s concept, the BRIC nations met informally in 2006 and formally in 2009, with South Africa being formally added to the group in 2010, organizing themselves as a counterbalance to the G-7 nations that dominate global geopolitical agendas.
As China rose in influence and power since the founding of the BRICS coalition — taking its position as the world’s second largest economy in 2010 — its voice and influence within this group has become more and more important. And as the largest trading partner of the world’s largest economy, the United States, it has de facto become a leading voice within this group.
However, China has aspired for a larger role than simply being a part of this group of nations for which a Goldman Sachs economist predicted big things by the middle of the 21st Century. Indeed, as we have written previously (e.g.,here), China’s goal since its economic opening in 1979 has been to reclaim its positions as a global economicandgeopolitical leader. Thus, we have seen China’s new positioning of itself as the leader of “South-South Cooperation” [nan-nan hezuo], investing in many “global south” nations under the auspice of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). We have seen China positioning itself as a broker of global geo-political cooperation, most prominently brokering a peace deal between Saudi Arabia and Iran.
Note the specific players in the expansion of the BRICS coalition. Here we see the additions of Argentina, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Egypt, and Ethiopia. And China is strongly positioning itself to be the leader of this expanded coalition. This is a bold move, and it is positioning China as a leader in a coalition that includes nations that are very important to the regions from which they are drawn.
The expansion and China’s role in the group is a huge victory for China.
6. Question: President Xi unexpectedly missed the BRICS final business forum, instead sending China’s Commerce Chief, who used Xi’s speech text at the event, urging the world to avoid sleepwalking “into the abyss of a new cold war.” What is Xi hoping to achieve with this positioning in response to the United States?
Answer: The media’s assumptions with respect to President Xi’s health may be a bit of a stretch. After this commerce session, Xi joined the banquet, and the sessions in the following two days. And he stopped over in Xinjiang on his way back to Beijing.
At it’s inception, each of the BRICS member countries had been in a certain stage of growth and development on their own yet wanted to be independent of other economic or political powers, because of their national characteristics and interests. Therefore, all the members including China are careful not to be seen as forming a bloc against G7, or any other alliances especially led by the US and the West.
To use the term “cold war mentality” often by Wang Yi (China’s foreign minister) in his party line to depict the current US-China opposition. By common understanding, cold war is live and death zero sum game, and is ideological. The US was the winner of the Cold War so the “mentality” may not be so terrible for Americans. But the concept of the world being divided into two blocs and mutually excluding each other is not attractive in today’s world. China claims it only promotes multilateralism, for which China gains the most in influence and as the world’s factory. So, the “new cold war” rhetoric is to put a negative spin on Biden’s us vs. them signboard of “democracy and autocracy”.
