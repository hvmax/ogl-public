### Everyday Leadership: Working to Build a World with Second Chances

23 October 2023|Everyday Leadership, Returning Citizens
AtOn Global Leadership, we have developed a new theory of leadership that steers away from the C-Suite, the charismatic leader approach to leading. Instead, we focus on what people do as leaders in their lives on a daily basis – every day everyone a leader.We have written about this concept in several articles (see, e.g.,here), profiling people likeDov Gelman,Jiyin Wang, andBrayden Harrington(and for the humility emphasis in everyday leadership, seehereandhere). We have been finding inspiration in our work withViaPath Corporationin support of the company’s work with Returning Citizens. This post is a continuation of earlier pieces we have written wrote about On Global Leadership’s theory of Everyday Leadership and the work we have been doing in this area around leadership teaching and coaching with incarcerated individuals and Returning Citizens (see, for example,here,here, andhere). In this post, we introduce the work of college student, Rhys Wonacott. Rhys recently completed an OGL Internship, where he conducted research on the pathways of three returning citizens and the challenges they face as they return to life beyond incarceration.
In our work with Returning Citizens, we are constantly impressed and overwhelmed by the leadership of individuals often overlooked by a society thirsty for examples of great leadership. One of the points of our work on Everyday Leadership is that we are looking in the wrong places. We often look to people who have climbed lifetime mountains, found fame in overcoming obstacles, led large groups of people from positions of power and authority. But we argue that leadership is all around us, in the example of a person nearby, who is striving make the world a little better through simple actions and commitments.
When OGL worked with Dan Wright and Tony Lowden to launch the Returning Citizens Advisory Group, the goal was to bring Returning Citizens together to help us think through the building of an ecosystem that could help Returning Citizens in their transition to post-incarceration life. That experience has resulted in powerful examples of Everyday Leadership, and we have written about some of those examples in previous posts. But Everyday Leadership was not only the province of the Returning Citizens present; it could also be found in a student learning to do research and focus on things that matter to him in the world.
We had three students in our Returning Citizens Advisory Group Meeting, held in June 2023. They were recruited by the founder of this gathering, Dan Wright (we have written about Dan previously,here). One of the students,Rhys Wonacott, a third year psychology major atCarleton College, approached me about doing some research for OGL. He then dove deep into a research project on Returning Citizens, with a focus on recidivism and the weak ecosystem – particularly the poor labor market opportunities – that Returning Citizens meet in their post-incarceration life. An example of Rhys’ work:
"When it comes to making the transition back into society, former prisoners lack support programs to smooth the way and, consequently, often boomerang back behind bars. Returning Citizens face financial hardship, housing challenges, and other hurdles that can cause an ex-inmate to stumble back into prison. A handful of reentry services likeViapathTechnologies, based in Falls Church, VA., aims to provide individualized support to returning citizens. The organization attempts to disrupt the cycle of incarceration by providing multidisciplinary support services beyond production of education tablets that allow returning citizens to earn GED degrees and learn everyday skills. Through extensive research on recidivism and interviews with returning citizen-turned leaders, I examine how increased involvement of the formerly incarcerated in reentry programs plays a role in potential legal and social solutions that can help ex-inmates get out and stay out of prison – and in the process build a successful life beyond bars. I found many organizations lack leadership involvement of the formerly incarcerated. Thus, the priorities of Returning Citizens aren’t met, the support is not personalized, and the effectiveness is not high enough to eliminate the existing reintegration challenges. The proper support is needed from coaches who have first-hand experience in reentry so that they know exactly how to handle prejudice, lack of resources, and emotional turmoil. This way, leaders of these support programs empathize with their struggles, but most importantly create long-term personal strategies to avoid a return to prison and to rebuild their lives."
Wow. Everyday Leadership will be producing this wonderful report researched and written by RhysWonacott. We are excited to see what you are going to do next. For the full report,click here.
