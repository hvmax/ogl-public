This is the fifth entry in a multi-partOn Global Leadershipseries on Systems Leadership. Theprevious postexploredSensemakingas a crucial concept and activity enabling the Systems Leader to engage and adapt to dynamic situations and complex environments. In particular, the post discussed the two keySensemakingcapabilities of regularly observing current conditions and scanning the environment for opportunities and then, having gained fresh perspective, re-framing thinking and action to pursue novel potential solutions. In this piece, critical attention turns to the correspondingSelfmakingthat leaders must also engage in as they attain new understandings of themselves and co-evolve with changing situations.
By Sara Beckman and David Slocum
In aprevious post, we exploredSensemakingas essential to systems thinking and leadership. We suggested that dialogue involving inquiry, divergence, and convergence is at the heart of the ability to seek and then act upon alternative frames. Inquiry forces individuals and groups to uncover assumptions (Schein1999) and acknowledge the limitations of their own existing perspectives. Diverging generates and acknowledges the legitimacy of alternative viewpoints. Converging negotiates meanings, shared mental models, and common understandings of a situation (Oliver and Jacobs2007). Importantly, theSensemakingprocess both involves leaders in dialog with one another and forces them to more deeply understand their own values, assumptions, and feelings as they strive to express them to others or adjust them to different situations or contexts. In this post, we examine these processes of exploration and representation of self in what we callSelfmaking.
Sensemakingemerged in organizational and management studies in the 1970s thanks to social psychologist Karl Weick, who used the term to refer to “sizing up a situation while you simultaneously act and partially determine the nature of what you discover” (2015). For leaders, making sense of situations entails engaging conditions outside oneself and interacting with others in order to effect a specific change or reach a desired end together. It also entails understanding one's own values, assumptions, and feelings and how and when those should be inserted in a situation and when they should be adapted. As Yiannis Gabriel has written, sensemaking is “a constant effort to impose order on our perceptions, experiences, and expectations” (2009).
Thus, we suggest, amidst their engagement of situations, other persons, and shifting contexts,Systems Leadersactively strive to understand and change themselves. ASystems Leaderrequiresa mindset of curiosity, clarity, compassion, choice, and courage(Goodman 2018) -- or, in Carol Dweck’s term, is characterized by a “growth mindset” (2007). That capacity turns onregularly framing and reframing, which, as discussed previously, requires the development of core capabilities to evaluate information for relevance, construct plausible inferences, accurately identify assumptions, distinguish relevant points of view, and parse significant from insignificant information (Duffy, Dueber, and Hawley 1998). Practically, this involves evaluating a broad range of viewpoints and perspectives; maintaining an open mind; accepting new evidence, explanations, and findings; being willing to reassess information; putting aside personal prejudices and biases; and considering all reasonable possibilities or explanations for dealing with situational variables and relationships. These only happen, of course, with a high degree of self-awareness.
Selfmaking,while the term may seem a bit grandiose, conveys the emphasis given by leaders to their values, experiences, traits, and tendencies – and how all of these help to orient leaders to engage with specific situations. Put differently, from the expansive reservoir of beliefs, tools, and capabilities that individual leaders could bring to a given moment, they must choose and experiment with which aspects of self are appropriate. LikeSensemaking,Selfmakinginvolves sizing up one’s own character in a context and dealing with others while simultaneously acting to re-shape oneself to engage new challenges and experiences. It requires thorough self-knowledgeanda commitment to explore and evolve one’s beliefs, values, and capabilities.
In other words,Selfmakingrefers to the learning and developmentbeyond what leaders already know or believethat they must pursue in order to grow themselves and guide others through uncertainty. This learning relates to a defining paradox of various forms of leadership development that seek to build on an individual’s values and character. The longtime paradox might be posed as, How can leaders both be faithful to their existing core values and principlesandadapt themselves to diverse situations and evolve over time? A general response, as London Business School professorHerminia Ibarra(2015) argues, is for leaders to develop personally and professionally by regularly reinventing themselves through micro-experiments and taking actions beyond what is familiar and known to them. For our discussion, the simultaneity of focused self-understanding and, through ongoing engagement with changing conditions, committed self-improvement enables learning and growth.
SensemakingandSelfmakingare intricately conjoined. One way to visualize their linkage is an infinity loop in which continuously making sense of shifting contexts contributes to ongoing learning and personal growth, just as one’s lifelong efforts to grow and develop as a leader and human being inevitably affect understanding and behavior in given situations. Cast in this way, we might return tothe metaphor of the balcony and the dance floorwith the realization that both of those interrelated perspectives are defined as fully by the leader’s character, self-understanding, and learning as by other persons and contexts. That is, the views from the balcony and the dance floor are each constituted by combining a sizing up of the changing situationanda reckoning of the leader’s evolving position in it. The idea (and activity) ofSelfmakingunderscores that learning is not a general imperative that vaguely moves projects from one state to another while leaders (and other team members) remain the same static beings. Rather, learning is a reflexive process that emerges from both the leader’s engagement with a situationandthat leader’s active self-understanding and behavior.
The vast uncertainty of 2020 has confirmed the value of continuous learning for organizations and leadership alike. The Boston Consulting Group (BCG) published in July 2020 a set of recommendations based on research that showed some companies have what BCG calls an “uncertainty advantage.” The recommendations were for companies to build three sets of capabilities: to sense and communicate thesignalsin noisy environments; to develop methodical visioning processes to guide thedecisionsrequired to put those signals into strategic actions; and to foster theresiliencerequired to consistently anticipate, recover and learn from changing contexts. Together, they provide an insightful set of priorities for organizations facing uncertainty.
However, as frequently happens, the otherwise helpful BCG guide looks almost entirely at the development of these capabilities at an organizational level. Only at the end does the focus turn to the crucial role of hands-on “active leadership” willing to demonstrate its beliefs in and commitment to building more adaptable organizations. Put simply, leaders themselves need to build their own capabilities for living and leading more successfully amidst uncertainty.
BCG’s three recommendations for companies are an excellent starting point for individuals, too, who benefit from becoming better signal detectors, analysts, and communicators (in our word,Sensemakers); decisive facilitators of alignment and execution; and effective contingency planners and fast learners. Running through these recommendations is the willingness and ability of leadership to learn and adapt with uncertain and dynamic situations. That willingness and ability to adapt to -- really, to co-evolve with -- shifting conditions means regularly exploring and understanding one’s own beliefs, principles, and experiencesandremaining open to experimenting with and growing oneself as those conditions change.
While necessary, the individual commitment of leaders to learn from and evolve with the conditions surrounding them is not alone sufficient to drive their growth and the success of their teams or organizations.Selfmakingnot only entails an inner focus or inside-out view grounded in leadership competences, but also insists theSystems Leaderpartake in a more complicated engagement with other persons and situational variables that position the leader socially or culturally in ways that extend beyond what the leaders may specifically know, decide, or do. This is an interactive engagement marked by the leader’s traits and behaviors,andothers’ perceptions of them. The traits and behaviors may include inherent factors like a leader’s gender, age, race, sexual orientation, or socio-economic background or acquired ones like their purpose, beliefs, experiences, expertise, and mindset. But for all, the resulting, outside-in view of leaders based in others’ perceptions gives shape to what, in ourSystems Leadermodel (Figure 1), we call theLeader-Symbol.
Recall that the value of the symbol is initially drawn from a recognition by former U.S. Army general Stanley McChrystal (2018) thatthe reality of leadershipstill proceeds to an extent through intangible elements like shared beliefs and meanings, purpose, and future potential that may be tied to individuals but ultimately are borne by collective leadership. An essential aspect of leadership of other persons and situational variables is thus theLeader-Symbol, which partly comprises the values, competences, and aspirations of leaders. Also important are the perceptions and intuitions of others about the leader, often biased or irrational and guided more by the leader’s confidence or charisma than their actual competence. The elements that define theLeader-Symbolserve as a shared basis for the interactions and relationships that enable collective activities and drive successful results. Put more simply, leaders must develop a self-understanding sufficient both to learn and adapt themselvesandto understand and adjust they are presenting themselves and being perceived in their interactions with others.
After all, even as a leader makes sense of and engages team members and others in given contexts, the others also size up and interact with that leader. Doing so calls attention to an under-examined aspect of leadership: namely, the persona or symbolism that the leader presents to other persons and the public. This is a general sociological reality, first described by Erving Goffman in 1956, in whichleaders present themselves to others and the worldin a manner resembling actors in the theater. Self-presentation is not necessarily false or misleading, but for leaders committed to acting in ways faithful to their values and beliefs, it acknowledges that every action in every situation cannot represent the full measure of one’s character. In fact, Goffman describes a key aspect of self-presentation as “impression management.” Leaders can be authentic to themselves, but they need to choose which aspects of themselves to communicate with others in specific situations and interactions.
“Impression management” raises a pair of other vital issues. One is leadership branding. If brands, generally, are a perception and promise of value, based on unique principles, characteristics, and strengths, their development for leadership offers a valuable opportunity for shaping that perception and promise. While an individual orpersonal leadership brandis important, the emphasis here is on collective leadership branding. Seen in this light, brands are important for the strategic positioning of a business and that can be bolstered by a positive focus on leadership. Management researchers Dave Ulrich and Norm Smallwood (2007) argue for “a shared identity among your organization’s leadersthat differentiates what they can do from what your rival leaders can do.” This also works internally. Based on later research, Ulrich and Smallwood (2019) contend that “a company with a favorable leadership brand inspires faiththat employees and managers will consistently make good on their brand promises to customers.”
A second issue related to “impression management” are the words themselves, which, in the decades since Goffman’s time, may increasingly connote the manipulation or deception of others. Rather than any such superficial performance or positioning, though, the phrase can become a basis for clarifying shared purpose, building safe and collaborative culture, and aligning group and other stakeholder resources around common goals. For leaders themselves, managing impressions can entail intentionally or unintentionally demonstrating, communicating, and modeling specific values and capabilities that engage the work and people in given situations.
Describinghow Apple is organized for innovation, for example, Apple University Dean Joel Podolny and faculty member Morten Hansen highlighted the “functional expertise” that distinguishes leaders at the company. While that approach and the individual expertise driving it has produced enormous impact for Apple, other approaches marked by differently managed impressions of disparate leadership capabilities better serve other firms. Determining how to manage the impressions or social presentation of which capabilities, like the self-understanding and ongoing development of those capabilities in the first place, is crucial for theSystems Leader.
Though not entirely under the control of leaders, the impressions that others have of them and their capabilities contribute to feedback loops that help to shape meanings and narratives in teams and organizations. The metaphor of the dance floor and the balcony is again helpful here, with the feedback loops adding a further dimension to the dynamics of each space. While leaders on the dance floor intervene in activities and engage others, their direct observations of and relationships with others form a complex web of interaction.
Likewise from the balcony, leaders gain perspective on the relevance of work and the nature of relationships that is partly a reaction to others’ impressions of them. Parsing these feedback loops requires not only a general willingness to increase self-understanding but an awareness of and commitment to act upon the beliefs, experiences, and biases one brings to that process.Selfmakingin this way captures both the complexity of leaders’ everyday engagement with situations and other personsandthe complexity of those leaders’ own learning and development.
Consider the case of Teresa Ressel, former CEO of UBS Securities LLC and Assistant Secretary and Chief Financial Officer of the United States Treasury, amongother accomplishments. Ressel has throughout her career been engaged deeply inSelfmaking, and in the process becoming known in particular for her ability to manage through crises. Crisis, Ressel argues,can bring out leadership qualities you never knew existed and forces you to get help from people you would not normally get help from. This has required her to have a deep understanding of her own strengths, and thus to readily recognize when she needs to rely on others.
Over the years, Ressel has developed what she calls a “bag of tricks” for how one can get people to agree to and ultimately change. Part of that has come from her realization that not everyone can make a decision and pivot immediately, something she is comfortable with herself. Thus, she learned to explain to them what is likely to happen in a given situation, to give them options for dealing with the situation, and then to align resources to be responsive to whatever “fork in the road” must be taken. In her world of compliance-related work, this often entails projecting changing laws and regulations and preparing leadership, peers, and other stakeholders to react when they are enacted.
Ressel spends plenty of time on the dance floor understanding the “flow of things” in the organization, listening to others, and capturing those “nuggets” that may be crucial to making an important pivot in the future. She is persistent in developing deep understanding, dissatisfied with simply hearing a presentation about “fishing,” but instead asking to be taken to the aquarium to be shown the “fish” firsthand. She tests the system by asking “for a BLT on wheat bread”; when a peanut butter and jelly sandwich arrives instead. She digs in to learn why the system isn’t flexible enough to make what is needed.
Ressel also spends time in the balcony finding the “third rails” – the issues or problems so charged that no one wants to touch them for fear of being marginalized or otherwise hurt – that guide her work in an organization. She won’t take a position that entails taking on “third rails” that don’t match with her personal values. But once on board, when she gets a call about a “third rail,” even if it isn’t in her area of responsibility or expertise, she answers. This has led her to unexpected places including the generator room at UBS during a power outage where the astonished folks accompanying her reminded one another that she does, after all, have an engineering background. Her ability to readily translate from balcony to dance floor and back again is at the heart of her success.
Ressel’sSelfmakingover the years is perhaps best summed up in one of her guiding principles: if she doesn’t know the answer to something, she will say so and then go find it. She strives to be self-sufficient, which means developing her own skills and capabilities. At the same time, she is committed to helping others develop self-sufficiency as well, guiding them to learn about themselves and their aspirations, and then urging them to tackle new opportunities. In this way, Ressel continues to learn and grow herself, while drawing upon appropriate representations of her leadership style to others that suit the variety of situations she is in with them.
If situationalSensemakingturns on metacognition and the management of sensory and environmental inputs, leadershipSelfmakingis similarly marked by the reflective presentation of self, co-evolution with changing conditions, and management of impressions by others both within and beyond teams or organizations. Together, these ongoing and interdependent activities are central to the work of theSystems Leader.
For our next piece, we will examine the influence, collaboration, and fostering of safe, flexible, and effective relationships between Systems Leaders and other persons – including colleagues, customers, investors, stakeholders, and citizens.
