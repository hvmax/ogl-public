### "The Banshees of Inisherin" & Practicing Leadership

31 January 2023|Creative Leadership, Culture, Leadership, Leadership Development, Practice of Leadership
This week, we begin a series of brief posts asking what we can learn about leadership from the Best Picture nominees recently announced by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Like most of you, we are moved by the culture around us, and often we learn from the arts, especially well-crafted feature films. We decided to take a look at this year's 10 nominated films and see what insights about leadership we can glean from the characters, plots, themes, or settings that animate these films. We at OGL believe the everyday practice of leadership, both in large and small ways, is what advances achievement. You'll find our "short takes" reflect both the major and minor events in life that allow us to demonstrate personal leadership. Our first contribution to this series is the highly praised "The Banshees of Inisherin".
The Singular Vision in "The Banshees of Inisherin"
By Sarah Kellogg
The "Banshees of Inisherin" takes place in 1923 on an island off the coast of Ireland. All is well until one of two friends, Colm (Brendan Gleeson), decides to end his friendship with Pádraic (Colin Farrell) because he’s seemingly too dull or "feckin' boring." Colm insists his remaining years must have more meaning than listening to his slow-witted friend. Instead, he wants to invest his musical talents into compose a masterpiece. Pádraic refuses to accept this friendship exile, and fights it at a terrible cost, even as his sister Siobhán (Kerry Condon) works to mend fences between the two men.
Directed and written by Martin McDonagh, the movie gives viewers an opportunity to see how individual fears, depression, and loneliness can turn into violence and lunacy for Colm and Pádraic. Interestingly enough, the one character in the film that cleaves to sanity is Siobhán. At first, we see her as a helpmate to her addled brother. But later on, we find she is the only person who makes sense of the break-up, even as she swings back and forth between commiserating with her brother’s loss and scolding the two former friends for their inane-turned-devilish divorce.
Though she is a secondary player to the men, with less than a quarter of the screen time, she has a refreshing and admirable vision for her own life -- a vision that runs beyond the shores of her remote birthplace. Rather than stay in relationship with the insanity and inanity, and the creeping gloom that inhabits the island, she discovers, plans, and executes her own vision for a bigger, more meaningful life than the one she was born into.
At On Global Leadership, we employ the VAMI framework to understand leadership in our educational and coaching programs. The framework focuses on vision, alignment, interpersonal motivation, and introspection. Siobhán’s vision for her world is built on a brutally honest introspection that allows her to consider her own future and then make the hard decisions to get there.

As the boat taking her from the island to a teaching position on the mainland pulls away from the dock, Siobhán looks back at the village, so familiar and safe, with a deep sadness. However, one feels like the sadness will be short-lived. She has wrested control of her own life to find peace and fulfillment. She has led herself out of the darkness to a brighter future. Understanding your vision and following it to its necessary conclusion is the sign of a good leader, especially one surrounded by confusion, trauma, and ignorance.
