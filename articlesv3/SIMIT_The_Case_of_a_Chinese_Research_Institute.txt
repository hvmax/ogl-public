AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy and, in particular, life in China. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. We have written a series about the strategic strength oflocal economic development in China’s 2nd and 3rd tier citiesandentrepreneurship in China today. We have written aboutinnovation in the Chinese economyandeconomic developmentas it relates tosocial inequality. We have also written about thestrategy and logic of local economic development in China’s reform era. This post furthers our analysis of China’s economic development by focusing onChina’s research institutesand powerful talent pool.

China’s incredible economic development path over the last 40 years, has depended on many foundational principles. Many observers point to China’s deep cheap labor pool, and the 300 million floating population as certainly played a critical role in China’s rise. It is also critical to think about China’s unique balance between central planning and local autonomy, creating a system that we calllocal governments as industrial firms(a notion that we borrowed from the great China scholar, Andrew Walder), where we have written about entrepreneurial local governments, who have built industrial clusters in places likeShenzhen,Foshan, and many others.
However, it is also critical to think about China’s deep investment in scientific and engineering research over the last four decades.China’s research instituteshave been a critical part of the economic development story.
For those who want to understand the system of scientific research in China, the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) is the main window. Having said this, with a staff of 67,900, 104 research institutes, 12 branch academies, three universities and 11 supporting organizations in 23 provincial-level areas throughout the country, CAS is a mammoth rivaling institutions like the U.S. Department of Energy. So, let’s begin this conversation by narrowing the scope down and start by getting to know the institutes under CAS. In our previousresearch institute post, we introduced the world-leading achievements in the research of quantum communication and quantum computing made by Pan Jianwei, a professor of the University of Science and Technology of China. Pan’s collaborative units are mainly within CAS, and among them, the Shanghai Institute of Microsystems and Information Technology Chinese Academy of Sciences (SIMIT) is one of the star institutes, and is also Pan’s most important partner. In this article, we will have a deep dive into SIMIT.
SIMIT in the 20th Century
The predecessor of SIMIT is the Institute of Engineering Academia Sinica established in 1928, one of the earliest engineering research institutions in China. The Institute became The Engineering Laboratory CAS in 1950 and changed its name to Institute of Metallurgical Ceramics CAS in 1953. After splitting the ceramic divisions in 1959, the metallurgical part became the Shanghai Institute of Metallurgy CAS (SIM) until 2001.
In more than 40 years of the SIM period, its research focus was solving specific problems of China's metallurgical industry and tracking international research in related fields. In the 1950s, SIM successfully made ductile iron for China, found recovery methods for rare earth elements, and solved many technical problems encountered by steel mills across the country. In the 1960s, SIM participated in the Manhattan Project of China by creating separation membrane of uranium 235 isotopes. In the 1960s and 1970s, the institute started research in microelectronics and integrated circuit technology. China's first bipolar integrated circuit, the first 8-bit and 16-bit microprocessor all came from SIM. In the mid-1980s, SIM carried out research on microelectromechanical systems (1) and silicon-on-insulator (SOI) materials.
In July 1997, Jiang Mianheng (the son of then Chinese President Jiang Zemin), who had returned from his studies in the United States, served as the fourth director of SIM. After taking office, Jiang began to plan the repositioning of the institute. Through thorough analysis of China's S&T (Science and Technology) strategy and the academic/technical strength of the institute, SIM chose information and communications technology (ICT) as its main research area. In May 2001, SIM changed its name to Shanghai Institute of Microsystems and Information Technology.
Current Research
In the 21s century, SIMIT put electronic science and technology, information and communication engineering as its research domain through five research disciplines: micro satellites, wireless sensor networks, future mobile communication technology, microsystem technology, and information functional materials and technologies. Now SIMIT has 8 divisions (Figure 3), among which 2020 X-Lab is a fundamental research platform specially established for young researchers in in-situ electronic structure research, quantum materials and devices, bioTech & infoTech and other cutting-edge technologies in informatics.
In the SIMIT era, the institute has delivered a series of eye-catching achievements. SIMIT is an important R&D center for China’s micro satellites, responsible for the system design of China’s first Dark Matter Particle Explorer (DAMPE, a satellite nick-named Wukong). Among the satellite's 1850-kilogram total weight, the experimental equipment load accounts for 1400 kilograms. While the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer experiments led by Samuel Ting, Nobel laureate and Professor of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, on the International Space Station cost $2 billion, China's DAMPE spent less than ￥500 million (US$77 million), with similar or even better features. In semiconductor field, its ASIC (2) chips based on SOI materials developed by SIMIT have been used in China's BeiDou Navigation Satellite System. Having been tested in various animals such as mice, rabbits, and monkeys, 2020 X-Lab’s brain-computer interface (BCI) is able to provide timely signal acquisition after operation and stable neural signal tracking for up to 8 months, its performance is comparable to that of Neuralink, a neurotechnology company of which Elon Musk is an investor. SIMIT has made breakthrough in single-photon detection, its plug-and-play superconducting nanowire single photon detector (SNSPD) has been used in the quantum key distribution and quantum computer of Pan Jianwei’s experiments.
S&T Achievement: A Transformational Trinity
China is moving aggressively toward a development model driven by science & technology. Whether S&T achievements can be transformed into productivity will greatly affect this transformation process. In 2021, the ratio of China’s R&D expenditure to gross domestic product (GDP) is 2.44%, close to 2.476%, the average of OECD countries in 2019. For a long period, because the conversion rate of China's S&T achievements is low, its contribution to the economy and social development is quite limited. Being a star in the transformation of S&T achievements in CAS system, how has SIMIT made it?
The success of SIMIT’s scientific research achievement transformation model lies in the establishment and effective operation of SIMIC Holdings Co., Ltd (SIMIC) and Shanghai Industrial & Technology Research Institute (SITRI).
SIMICis the outcome of cooperation between CAS and Shanghai Municipal Government to develop integrated circuits in the 1980s. It was originally called Shanghai Microelectronics Research and Development Base. In 1995, it was restructured into a limited liability company of which SIMIT holds 53% of the shares, and a company affiliated to the Shanghai Municipal Government holds 47%. SIMIC is thus an incubator. By the end of 2020, SIMIC had invested more than 100 companies in the ICT field and has created more than 3,000 jobs, total assets of these companies exceed ￥30 billion.
SITRIwas established in May 2013 to enhance the capability of product trial and production for technologies developed in the labs. In its early stage, SITRI mainly relied on funds from local district government where it is located, the arrangement is that guaranteed funds decrease year by year, and is replaced by incentive funds at certain percentage of the revenue generated by SITRI. So far, government funds account for about 15% of SITRI's operating expenses. The most prominent achievement of SITRI is China's first 8-inch silicon photonics pilot line that was completed in 2021. The project is called “More than Moore”.
In the media, SIMIT’s S&T achievement transformation system is referred to as a “Trinity”; SIMIT focuses on original technological innovation with “principle prototypes”; SITRI turns prototypes into products through pilot production; SIMIC realizes the transformation from product to commodity. So far, SIMIC has incubated more than 10 hard core technology companies including 3 IPOs. National Silicon Industry Group is the largest of these with current market value at about US $10 billion. The income from the industrialization feeds back the research work of the institute, forming a virtuous circle.
Organization and Human Resources
Even for a person familiar with China, understanding the organizational structure and staffing of the CAS Institutes is not an easy task. In theory SIMIT is a public institution, but in reality, it is a self-financed organization. Less than 40% of its revenue comes from government financial appropriation, the rest are obtained through competition. The personnel of the institute are divided into institution staff and non-institution staff or contract employees, similar to tenure (for institution staff) and PI (non-institution staff) of American universities. In addition to the job at SIMIT, researchers can also work part-time at SITRI or SIMIC. The operating model of most institutes affiliated to CAS is similar to SIMIT.
Anyone who aspires to a research position or become a project leader must go through a competitive selection process. Many important research positions are open to external talent, and usually a three-year-contract will be provided. Taking 2020 X-Lab as an example, the annual salary of young researchers is at minimum ￥400,000 (US$63,000), the start-up funding for their research projects are roughly from ￥3 to 5 million (US$479,000 - 790,000), and the institute usually continues to provide funds to support each research group every year. The culture of 2020 X-Lab is focused on “unleashing imagination and creativity”.
Since the reform of human resource system of research institutes in the late 1990s, CAS has broken the identity restriction of researchers and built a mechanism to mobilize talents through competition. But its sequela is that researchers have to spend a lot of time and energy to get competitive funding and thus cannot concentrate on research. After all, how many scientists are also good business person? SIMIT's approach is to differentiate according to research types, ensure funding for fundamental research. Besides financial allocations, SIMIT provides support to fundamental research projects through the funds raised from applied research projects and investment revenue at SIMIC and SITRI.
How to Evaluate Scientific Research Institutions in China?
The reform of S&T system in China started in 1985. The evaluation and assessment a research institute used to be based on quantitative measures such as the number of awards, the number of papers published, especially the number of SCI or NSC (Nature, Science and Cell) papers, and amount of research funds etc. Although these standards seem objective, too much emphasis has been put on quantitative indicators. As a result, research institutes and scientists were busy with resource acquisition and have a tendency to pursue quick wins. At the beginning of 2012, the leadership of CAS decided to reform the S&T evaluation system by building a major achievement output-oriented research institute evaluation mechanism, mainly judged from the following seven aspects:
Solve key scientific questionsForge new research directionsBreakthrough in core technologiesProvide systematic solutionsGenerate significant social and economic benefitsMake consultative proposals that have a significant impact on the country
• Solve key scientific questions
• Forge new research directions
• Breakthrough in core technologies
• Provide systematic solutions
• Generate significant social and economic benefits
• Make consultative proposals that have a significant impact on the country
The new evaluation system pays more attention to the opinions of peers and key users. Every five years, CAS invites peer experts and user experts at home and abroad to conduct an evaluation for each institute.
According to the new criteria, SIMIT's contribution to achievements like the Dark Matter Particle Explorer, quantum communication, quantum computer and 12-inch wafer production process belong to "Breakthrough in core technologies", "Provide systematic solutions" and "Significant social and economic benefits ". SIMIT has become one of the star research institutes within CAS. Wang Xi, the sixth director of SIMIT, was promoted from the position to deputy minister of the Ministry of Science and Technology in 2019.
SIMIT represents the direction of research institute with Chinese characteristics:
Business model: public institutions with enterprise operationHR policy: open and competitiveSufficient fundingEffective transformation model of S&T achievementsSustained high quality research output
• Business model: public institutions with enterprise operation
• HR policy: open and competitive
• Sufficient funding
• Effective transformation model of S&T achievements
• Sustained high quality research output
If there are shortcomings of SIMIT, the first one is the lack of an academic superstar like Pan Jianwei. The second is that the academic reputation of the institute still needs to improve. But neither of these can be achieved in a short period of time, just like China's efforts to catch up with global leaders in the fields of software, semiconductor and bioengineering. SIMIT is a microcosm of China's S&T development: it has been a long time in coming, but at this point, there is a good deal of momentum.
