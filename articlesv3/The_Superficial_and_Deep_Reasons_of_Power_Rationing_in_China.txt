### The Superficial and Deep Reasons of Power Rationing in China

15 November 2021|China, Climate Change
AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy and, in particular, life in China. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. We have sought to advance a conversation about the U.S.-China relationship, and a deep understanding of local economic development in China. We have written a series about the strategic strength oflocal economic development in China’s 2nd and 3rd tier citiesandentrepreneurship in China today. We have written aboutinnovation in the Chinese economyandeconomic developmentas it relates tosocial inequality. We have also written about economic development as it relates to environmental issues in China (see, for example, our publication on theHistoric Loess Plateau). This post adds to that conversation. – The Editorial Team

As leaders from around the world gathered in Scotland for the COP26, climate change moved to the top of the global agenda and played out against the backdrop an of energy crisis that is impacting worldwide energy markets as natural gas prices have skyrocketed and threatened the stability of nations small and large. Chief among those countries experiencing energy aftershocks is China, which has been responding to electricity stoppages (停电), with power rationing and rolling blackouts that have shut down factories and hobbled China's vaunted supply chain.
In our discussion here, we would like to add some empirical data and analytical nuance to the debate over the power issues that are occurring in China today. There are three issues here: (1) the global power supply chain, which is central to China’s global manufacturing supply chain; (2) the Chinese State-market relations in balancing state-subsidized allocation of power and an emerging market pricing system; and (3) global pressures over types of power and climate change.
One of the most important reasons for switching off electricity and power rationing in some parts of China is the short supply of coal. This sounds simple but the empirical reality is complex and difficult to resolve in the short term. (In Figure 1, “Thermo” includes coal, petroleum, and natural gas.) As the figure shows, China’s coal powered energy supply is about 56.8%, with about 8% reflecting imported coal. Eight percent, which is equal to about 14% of the entire Thermo category, may not sound like a lot, but that 14% is critical. When global markets fluctuate – whether as a result of trade and other geopolitical tensions or even climate change talks – the consequences for energy supply can be serious.
Energy consumption control targets are assessed by the Central Government on a quarterly basis. In Figure 2, we compare power consumption control across provinces in the first half of 2021 with the provinces and cities that switched off and limited power in September 2021. It indicate that some regions are purely out of a sudden scare. And the non-fossil energy power generation (esp. hydro) in some areas did not reach the predicted levels, a fact that also contributed to the current crisis.
The deeper reason for this energy instability is that China’s energy industry has been a mixture of market and planned economy approaches for many years. It enjoyed the double dividends of market and planned economy in smooth periods (e.g., controlling and maintaining manufacturing costs), but it must bear the blow of these institutional defects when problems arise. Since the beginning of China's economic reform, some of the key resource industries such as energy have never seen price reform completed. In the case of power, the price of electricity is controlled but the coal supply is very much market oriented.
Why is China, the world’s largest coal producer and consumer (its coal production is 47% of the world's total in 2019, short of coal? First, during the 13FYP period, China’s coal industry was vigorously reduced. The news has reported that a total of about 1 billion tons of coal production capacity was shut down during the 13FYP period, while the fully approved coal production capacity from 2016 to 2020 was only about 350 million tons. This approach to energy management has laid the ground for the current round of shortages and soaring coal prices.
Second, legal punishment for exceeding production quotas and anti-corruption campaigns trace back for 20 years, effectively deterring non-compliant behaviors. One case revealed that a mining company in Yulin (榆林) ranked first with a rated capacity of 1.2 million tons a year, but the actual output in 2018 was as high as 5.42 million tons, which was 452% of the approved capacity. Under a new law put in place, this structural flaw will be settled for a while. Therefore, price hikes and supply shortages will not be resolved in the near term. Past actions have been stressed further by China's goals for climate change mitigation and adaptation. China has pledged to achieve carbon emissions peaks by 2030 so it can reach carbon neutrality by 2060, the so-called 3060 plan.
The Chinese government attaches great importance to the problem of power rationing and is responding. On October 8, Premier Li Keqiang held an executive meeting of the State Council, proposing to expand the range of market transaction electricity price up to 20%. On October 9, Li also presided over the meeting of the National Energy Commission. It is worth noting that there are multiple factors involved in China's current energy predicament: the power shortage is creating energy insecurity; 3060 goals will take time and require long-term commitment, despite challenges; one-size-fits-all power and production restrictions to respond to political or societal concerns such as climate change come at a cost; and the current juncture requires active leaders who can resolve chaos.
This shows a slight misalignment between the 3060 promise and the State Council’s effort to maintain a smooth transition to fix the pricing issue as well as to implement clean and green energy usage gradually. The current power outage and power constraints revealed the incomplete reforms on energy prices, the drive for a robust national GDP vs. environmental goals, and an unsophisticated leadership style to handle a very complex problem. An effective way forward will involve balancing trade and geopolitical tensions, the internal state subsidy and market pricing system, and global pressures around climate change.
