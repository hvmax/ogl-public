On Global Leadership’s regular feature OGL Real Time presents our up-to-the-minute insights on current news and events. We hope these breaking news insights from our OGL team members will help illuminate the events of the day and provide the depth needed to understand global political, economic, and cultural transitions and transformations. In this post, we reflect on the U.S. presidential election and what the election means for U.S.-China relations going forward. We propose a view that President-elect Donald Trump is a lot more like the Communist authoritarian dictator Mao Zedong than we might like to acknowledge.
On January 20, 2025, the United States will swear into office a new yet very familiar president, Donald J. Trump.  Given the nation’s history with the former president, we have deep concerns about the direction in which American society is headed. The country is being driven today by an irrepressible populist movement, one where individuals enthusiastically follow a charismatic, authoritarian-oriented leader, one who revels in the limelight and the notion he is the savior of a declining society.
Trump is not averse to connecting himself to divine intervention. Recently, he said, “I would like to think that God saved me for a purpose… And that’s to make our country greater than ever before” (Donald Trump Suggests He Was Literally Anointed by God, Eric Lutz, October 22, 2024,Vanity Fair).  For Trump, there is a divine purpose here, not only in being saved from a sniper’s bullet but also in being elected after losing the presidency in 2020. And, sadly, a significant portion of American society seems to believe the same.
Leaving aside the divine intervention, Trump is not the first in world history to think of himself as the savior for a people. Indeed, one interesting comparative case is that of Chinese Communist political leader, Mao Zedong. When we think about Mao at this moment in the 21st century, we think of an unbalanced, authoritarian dictator, who led the Cultural Revolution and drove China to the brink of chaos and insolvency by the time of his death in 1976.
Of course, we aren’t the first analysts to see an alignment between the two political leaders. A number of people speculated about the many similarities between the men, as well as the potential that Trump could take a similar path as Mao. “In many ways I think [Trump] is like Mao Zedong,” said Orville Schell, director of the Asia Society’s Center on U.S.-China relations, in 2017. “I say that not facetiously. … He was a revolutionary, he was a populist, and he came in wanting to turn over the old order. ‘If you don't destroy, you can't construct.’”
And the similarities have also inspired artists to humorously illustrate a Mao-Trump connection.The South China Morning Newsspeculated about the overlap in November 2019, during Trump’s first term as president, in a Tom Plate column, “America is living under the threat of a Mao-like figure -- Donald Trump.” The story was accompanied by this clever editorial cartoon (Figure 1).
All of the comparisons may be the stuff of nightmare scenarios for Democrats in the U.S. -- many Republicans would call it hyperbole, not reality. But if we take a few steps back, and look more deeply at Mao's history in China, we might find a parallel that is equally interesting and disturbing.
When Mao was the charismatic visionary leading China to fight against the capitalist authoritarian leaders of the Chinese Nationalist Party (Guomindang, or KMT), he was leading a populist movement fighting to bring China back to the working class. (Sounds familiar, right?) As an aside, we are not the first group of scholars to have written about this. Indeed, Bin Song’sDonald Trump, Mao Zedong and Religious Anti-Intellectualism(Routledge 2022), , is an early bellwether book to make the comparison we are making here, the comparison between the anti-intellectualism of Donald Trump and Mao Zedong.
Back in 1945, Mao was a populist, charismatic leader fighting to bring his population back from the capitalist forces of America. Mao was not the crazy authoritarian dictator we think of today; he was a magnetic leader advocating for the working class of China. The interesting thing here is that a lot of the anti-foreign populist rhetoric we see in Trump today can be found in the authoritarian behavior of dictators like Mao.
“When the communists proclaimed the founding of a ‘new China’ on October 1, 1949, Mao Zedong and his fledgling government set in motion the creation of a new society. The emergence of communism under Mao fundamentally altered the social, political, and economic structure of Chinese life… The strategy of the party, at this point, became the mobilization of the population through mass campaigns in which communist ideology would be spread, and people energized by the ideology and commitment to the party would emerge as urban cadres. In 1950, in a campaign called the Resist America and Aid Korea Campaign, the party ordered searches of all alleged spies – all foreigners – and investigated all public associations that were in any way connected with foreigners; many individual Chinese were also investigated for contact with foreigners.” [Guthrie (2013)]
Again, we see echoes to Trump, who has consistently expressed strong views on immigration, particularly concerning undocumented migrants in the United States. Throughout his political career, he has characterized migrants as a significant threat to national security and public safety. His rhetoric has often included dehumanizing language, referring to some migrants as "animals" and asserting that they are "poisoning the blood of our country." During his 2024 presidential campaign, Trump pledged to implement the largest deportation operation in U.S. history, aiming to remove millions of undocumented individuals from the U.S.
Mao extended his antipathy to foreign interests to the business community. “The party also moved against foreign businesses, freezing all assets in December 1950. Workers were encouraged to rise up against their exploitative employers… The government followed this movement with a second mass campaign in 1951 directed at domestic ‘counterrevolutionaries.’ The targets of this mass campaign were officially the individuals who had served under or supported the Nationalist Party, but the target, more generally, was anyone who was suspected of not supporting the party. … The ‘Three-Anti’ and ‘Five-Anti’ campaigns followed in 1951 and 1952, respectively. The first of these was directed at three sets of vices, which were associated with three groups: corruption, waste, and obstructionist bureaucracy, directed at Chinese Communist Party (CCP) officials, the wider spectrum of bureaucratic officials, and managers of factories. Ironically, though directed at corruption among officials and business leaders, this movement was also used to gain greater control over labor: the government took over all labor unions and made them a part of the party infrastructure. The second campaign was designed to ferret out and vanquish the bourgeoisie class in China (similar to, and contemporaneous with, the campaign against capitalists and landlords in the countryside). The targets were those Chinese businessmen who represented the capitalist class. In addition to being arrested and forced to confess to crimes against the party, capitalists were also encouraged to denounce each other.”
Trump has already signaled his interest in picking economic winners and losers, not only among immigrants but also among business leaders who have failed to show enough fealty to him. In June 2024, he stated on Truth Social, his social media platform, that, "Business Executives and Shareholder Representatives should be 100% behind Donald Trump! Anybody that’s not should be FIRED for incompetence!" Denouncing each other cannot be far behind.
Back with Mao: “These [Mao] campaigns not only asserted the communist control over the people ideologically, but it also allowed the communists to step in and take control of industrial organizations, ending the independent modes of operation and production in the Chinese economy. While these campaigns set the stage for a terror-driven ideological control, there was also an infrastructure for individual-level social control. The institutions for this individual-level social control were also integrally linked to the economy. In the urban industrial economy, these were the work unit and the neighborhood association system; in the rural economy, these were the collectives and communes. Thus, as they were creating a new order of discipline in society, the communists were also extending their reign over the economy. The new government adopted a number of measures that would allow them to control production in both agricultural and industrial arenas. The model adopted was that of the Soviet Union, where state-controlled industrial production in a sequence of five-year plans was believed to have been responsible for the nation’s emergence as a world class power in the 1930s. There was close collaboration between the Soviet Union and China during this period, as Soviet technical advisers came to China to help with factory building, industrial planning, electric power, the railway system, and urban architecture.”
The country was organized into a tightly nested hierarchy in which party planning was carried out through a central government (in Beijing), twenty-two provinces, five autonomous regions, and three municipalities. Under these were approximately 2,200 county governments, which in turn supervised about one million branch offices of the CCP in towns, villages, army units, factories, and schools. In rural areas, in 1952 and 1953, the government put households together into groups of thirty to fifty households, and land and labor were pooled together into cooperative units. Originally, peasants held a private component in which they were allowed to keep private plots for their own use—to raise crops for their own consumption or to be sold. Balances after government quotas were met were divided based upon how much each family contributed originally. Thus, this was not a fully socialist system as richer peasants, who had contributed more land, did better in the end.”
However, many of these policies had ill effects. “Following the devastating effects of these economic policies, Mao lost political power in significant ways. Deng Xiaoping and Liu Xiaoqi were gaining political credibility, and they were increasingly critical of Mao and his policies. But Mao was still the charismatic leader of China. He was the leader of a movement that, in retrospect, is appropriately referred to as the 'cult of Mao.' He was seen as the leader who gave self-reliance and self-respect back to the Chinese. Despite his failed economic policies, he was still the leader of the revolution. And he was the most powerful man in China in terms of his ability to mobilize political power.”
Interesting echo here too. Trump’s first-term economy benefited early on from the tactics deployed by former President Obama. By the time Trump's term ended, the U.S. economy, thanks largely to the pandemic, was seriously flagging. His failed policies resulted in a near cataclysmic economic crash, helping to trigger years of failed businesses and inflation, yet many voters say they voted for Trump because they believe he will be able to reduce inflation and rescue the economy. It made sense to voters that Trump could bring “self-respect” back to a time of economic uncertainty. "I want to thank millions of Americans for showing up in record numbers and delivering a victory. We will pay you back and do our best job. We will turn it around, in every way. This will be remembered as the day the American people regained control of the country,” Trump said on election night.
“The mid-1960s saw the emergence of a group of intellectuals who were critical not just of Mao’s policies but also of his isolation from the public. A well-respected Ming historian named Wu Han began to write extensively about Mao’s poor judgment and policies. In September 1965, Mao attempted to begin a movement to criticize the ‘reactionary bourgeois ideology,’ but found little success because much of the state media was controlled by his political opponents. He left Beijing in November and disappeared from public view; it was later learned that he had gone to Shanghai, where he assembled a group of hardline communist intellectuals to help him bring socialist order back to the country.”
“The leaders of the Cultural Revolution called for a comprehensive attack on the four ‘old’ elements within Chinese society – old customs, old habits, old culture, and old thinking – but they left it to local Red Guards to direct this movement. As a result, the movement spun completely out of control. Eventually, everyone in power was in danger of being labeled a capitalist roader, a counterrevolutionary, and an enemy of the party. This led to clashes between the Red Guard radicals and the People’s Liberation Army. By September 1967, all leaders, including those in the radical wing of the party, agreed that the chaos had reached an intolerable level. They began denouncing ‘ultra-left tendencies.’ It was not until the summer of 1968 that something resembling order was restored. A retrenchment movement followed, in which hundreds of thousands of Red Guard radicals were ‘sent down’ to the countryside for ‘reeducation.’ Many of these youths spent a decade of their lives working in hard agricultural labor in the countryside. They were only able to return to their homes after Mao died in 1976.”
While Trump has not advocated for reeducation camps, he has sought to reshape school curricula to reflect his perspectives on American history and values. Trump has advocated educational reforms aimed at promoting what he describes as "patriotic education." In 2020, he established the 1776 Commission to promote a curriculum that emphasized a positive view of American history. He also has backed measures to eliminate education programs that support critical race theory and gender ideology in schools, asserting that such content constitutes "left-wing indoctrination." He said federal funds should be used as leverage to influence school curricula and policies.
What does all of this mean for the Trump-Mao comparison? Like Trump, Mao Zedong was first an appealing populist leader with authoritarian tendencies. Mao  tapped into the pain of Chinese society and became the leader of the populist movement that would become the Communist Revolution. Not so far away from Trump’s vision of the MAGA (Make America Great Again) movement as a cultural and political phenomenon that will reshape American society and life.
Eventually, Mao’s oversized, savior-oriented ego went crazy, and led China down a dark path, which included isolationism, stiffling economic policies, and a radical internal social movement. He launched the Great Leap Forward and, eventually, the Cultural Revolution. In the aftermath, it all looks certifiably crazy. But, if you go back and look at the history, it is possible to see where a populist-zeal transformed into a level of craziness that led to an unfathomable reign of terror, marked by widespread chaos, persecution of intellectuals, destruction of cultural heritage, and the disruption of millions of lives.
Trump might not seem certifiably crazy right now, though he makes no apologies for his affinity for dictators and their power. He is leading a movement that is fundamentally racist and anti-global and may drive the United States into an abyss of insularity and provincialism. We know this may be an insulting comparison for some, but, from our own research, we think Trump seems a lot like the Chairman Mao of 1949.
