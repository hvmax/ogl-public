On Global Leadership's regular feature, OGL Real Time, presents our up-to-the-minute insights on current news and events. We hope these breaking news insights from our OGL team members will help illuminate the events of the day and provide the depth needed to understand global political, economic, and cultural transitions and transformations. In this post, we examine China’s recent Central Economic Work Conference, 2023.
China’s continued growth and development is intimately tied to the legitimacy of the Party itself and to the nation’s legitimacy and power in the world today. Earlier this month, we had a chance to observe one of the moments in which the Party conducts a self-assessment on its performance in economic policy for the previous year, and previews its economic goals for the year ahead.
Every December, members of China’s top leadership gather in Beijing to discuss the state of the country’s economy, challenges it faces, the long-term outlook, and to set the priorities of the economic agenda for the coming year. The two- to three-day annual meeting is called the Central Economic Work Conference. The 2023 Conference was held Dec. 11-12, and it unveiled the economic blueprint for the world’s second-largest economy for 2024.
Here is how the Conference assessed China’s current economic situation (2):
China’s economy has achieved a recovery, with solid progress made in high-quality development in 2023.To further revive the economy, China still has to overcome some difficulties and challenges, including a lack of effective demand, overcapacity in some sectors, demanding social expectations, avoiding and rapidly addressing key risks and hidden problems, bottlenecks in the domestic circulation, and the rising complexity and uncertainty of the external environment.
• China’s economy has achieved a recovery, with solid progress made in high-quality development in 2023.
• To further revive the economy, China still has to overcome some difficulties and challenges, including a lack of effective demand, overcapacity in some sectors, demanding social expectations, avoiding and rapidly addressing key risks and hidden problems, bottlenecks in the domestic circulation, and the rising complexity and uncertainty of the external environment.
With regard to achievements, China has achieved a 5% GDP growth rate, the target set in March 2023. Western media commonly depict China’s performance in this key indicator as being “below expectation,” and this dismissal of China’s performance has been the most profound footnote of the country’s economy throughout the year.
Western media also seem to downplay China’s technical breakthroughs, most notably that marked by Huawei Mate 60 Pro smartphone, a signal that China has made significant progress bypassing U.S. semiconductor technology embargoes.
Compared with depictions used in 2021 and 2022, the triple pressure of “demand contraction, supply shock, and weakening expectations,” the descriptions of current difficulties and challenges are more specific and adequate.
For example, insufficient demand is replaced by insufficient effective demand. What does “effective” mean here? We have seen examples not definitions: a project that creates jobs and positive cash flow is “effective”; improving old urban underground pipelines that reduce potential risk is also considered “effective”; but a new metro project in a city where current metro capacity has not been fully utilized is “not effective.”
Addressing these challenges, the readout of the Conference introduces some new description that are important signals for adjustments to economic policy implementation:
The economy is the first priority. High-quality development is “the absolute principle in the new era”; promoting Chinese modernization is “the greatest political task.” (3) These strong words demonstrate a clear and unmistakable message on the importance of continued economic development and modernization for China in the years to come.Working methodology.The Conference emphasized that macro policies for 2024 need to “pursue progress while ensuring stability, consolidate stability through progress, and establish the new before abolishing the old” (稳中求进、以进促稳、先立后破). Compared with the tone set in the Conference one year ago for 2023 – “prioritize stability while pursuing progress” (稳字当头、稳中求进) – Beijing is demanding economic work in 2024 be more proactive and aggressive. Accordingly, we assume China’s GDP growth target for 2024 will not be less than 5%.Sequencing policies.The admonition against “Adopting new approaches before phasing out older ones” can be viewed as guidance for correcting some radical practices implemented in the past few years, such as allowing for a real estate boom, internet platform enterprises, carbon emission reduction, etc. The implication here is that the fulfillment of new policies will be more prudent and moderate in future.The coordination and consistency between policies.The Conference put forward that “non-economic policies should be included in macroeconomic policy consistency assessment,” a refinement of “consistency of macroeconomic policy orientation” proposed at the CPC Politburo meeting, held a few days before the Conference. In China, policy conflicts are not uncommon due to different objectives, and the situation is no worse today than it has been in the past.
1. The economy is the first priority. High-quality development is “the absolute principle in the new era”; promoting Chinese modernization is “the greatest political task.” (3) These strong words demonstrate a clear and unmistakable message on the importance of continued economic development and modernization for China in the years to come.
2. Working methodology.The Conference emphasized that macro policies for 2024 need to “pursue progress while ensuring stability, consolidate stability through progress, and establish the new before abolishing the old” (稳中求进、以进促稳、先立后破). Compared with the tone set in the Conference one year ago for 2023 – “prioritize stability while pursuing progress” (稳字当头、稳中求进) – Beijing is demanding economic work in 2024 be more proactive and aggressive. Accordingly, we assume China’s GDP growth target for 2024 will not be less than 5%.
3. Sequencing policies.The admonition against “Adopting new approaches before phasing out older ones” can be viewed as guidance for correcting some radical practices implemented in the past few years, such as allowing for a real estate boom, internet platform enterprises, carbon emission reduction, etc. The implication here is that the fulfillment of new policies will be more prudent and moderate in future.
4. The coordination and consistency between policies.The Conference put forward that “non-economic policies should be included in macroeconomic policy consistency assessment,” a refinement of “consistency of macroeconomic policy orientation” proposed at the CPC Politburo meeting, held a few days before the Conference. In China, policy conflicts are not uncommon due to different objectives, and the situation is no worse today than it has been in the past.
However, now that the easy part of China’s economic growth story has come to an end, coupled with today’s severe geopolitical environment, the challenges for further healthy economic development continue to grow. This is why the current negative effects of the conflict between policies become more prominent.
Sometimes seemingly unrelated non-economic policies like fire protection, medical care, or education have become the last straw that crushes an enterprise or an industry. It is clear that the issue has caught the attention of China’s top leadership, but it is not an easy problem to solve.
The meeting listed nine aspects as priorities in 2024 economic work. At the top of the list is “sci-tech innovation should lead the development of a modern industrial system.” Specific fields highlighted for technological advancement include (among others): artificial intelligence, biotechnology, drones, green technology, and quantum computing.
“Promoting high-level scientific and technological self-reliance and self-improvement” appeared for the first time in the overall requirements of economic work. There should be little doubt that China is preparing for the worst-case scenario in the years to come.
2023 marks the 45th anniversary of China’s reforms and opening up. From the above-mentioned new formulation of the Conference, we can see the connection with proven successful experience of reform and opening up, such as "take economic construction as the central task," "development is the absolute principle," "crossing the river by feeling the stones"(4), and so on.
In general, the 2023 Central Economic Work Conference aspired to deliver an objective judgment on the issues facing China’s economy and put forward new ideas on how to deal with these challenges. In the coming year, we will watch to see how the blueprint is translated into concrete action through policies and what tangible results can be felt by Chinese citizens. The key is how to motivate officials at all levels to take initiative to creatively deliver on the broad goals outlined by the Party at this Conference.
