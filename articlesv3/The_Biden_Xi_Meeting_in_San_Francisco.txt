On Global Leadership's regular feature, OGL Real Time, presents our up-to-the-minute insights on current news and events. We hope these breaking news insights from our OGL team members will help illuminate the events of the day and provide the depth needed to understand global political, economic, and cultural transitions and transformations. In this post, we examine U.S.-China relations in the context of Chinese President Xi Jinping’s visit to San Francisco for the annual Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) meeting, where he is meeting with President Joe Biden. This Real Time Q&A considers those activities and attitudes and their impact. In this case, our specific questions summarize significant topics of “chatter” occurring over the last several days on Chinese social media.
From the OGL Team
1.Why are the two presidents meeting at this moment?
The context for Chinese President Xi Jinping’s visit to San Francisco is the 2023 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Meeting. APEC is an organization that focuses on trade, investment, economic development, and cooperation among countries and economic areas that border the Pacific Ocean. Held annually, the organizations members meet to discuss critical issues for APEC members. Hosting responsibilities rotate among the organization’s roster of 21 members. When APEC was formed in 1989, there were 12 economic areas, and the first meeting in Canberra, Australia was relatively informal. China joined APEC in 1991, and the organization was first hosted by a national leader when President Clinton hosted the 1993 meeting in Seattle.
APEC meetings are usually attended by members' ministers, secretaries, and other economic leaders. They are not usually a venue for summit meetings between national or area presidents, though Biden and Xi are making a habit of running into each other economic gatherings – it should not be lost on anyone that Presidents Biden and Xi met with each other a year ago, almost to the day, at the 2022 G20 meeting in Bali.
In addition, there may be added historical symbolism here: In 1993, when Bill Clinton hosted the APEC meeting in Seattle, U.S.-China relations were in difficult straights in the wake of the 1989 Tiananmen crackdown. Staring down much criticism from within China, President Jiang Zemin flew to Seattle to personally meet with Clinton. While some internal China dissenters viewed this as coming cap-in-hand to meet the U.S. president, history proved the 1993 Seattle Presidential Summit to be a strong political move by Jiang. The meeting brought U.S.-China relations back to an engagement tone and was one early of the markers along the path of China’s eventual entry into the WTO in 2001.
President Xi may very well be reading this history and realizing this is a potentially important moment to ensure a positive path for repairing US-China relations in the post-Trump Era. This is, once again, an especially important moment for China, as the economy struggles with a number of issues – falling consumer prices, a real estate bubble, missed growth projections – in the post-COVID era. President Xi is very likely reading all of these signals and has decided to follow his predecessor’s example of thirty years earlier and come to US soil to meet with the US President.
So, why are the two presidents meeting at this moment? First, this is a meeting between the world’s two largest economies, which are also the world’s two largest trading partners. There are many serious tensions globally, and it may simply be the case that maintaining economic stability may be one way for leading countries to signal that, even with tragic wars raging, leaders of powerful nations are still coming together to meet and cooperate. The message here is, even in the midst of global crises, and in the context of significant disagreements between our two powerful nations, we will not miss this opportunity to signal collaboration and cooperation. And there is also a message of how important economic engagement is for both countries right now. As noted above, China’s economy is currently struggling on a number of fronts, and continued economic integration and cooperation between trading partners is crucial. It is also important to emphasize here that this is not just a summit meeting of Presidents Xi and Biden, this is also the APEC meeting of international economic leaders. Also, critical during this get-together is the CEO dinner, which will include such luminaries as Tesla’s Elon Musk and Microsoft’s Satya Nadella.
A second level of meaning for this meeting is that this is a play for a continuation of positive talks between the two nations. In the last decade, U.S.-China relations have grown significantly tense and distrustful. This has been the result of strident behavior on both sides, and there is reason to be concerned as relations between the world’s two largest economies (and two of the world’s three largest militaries) decline. However, there have been positive signs. As noted above, the Biden-Xi G20 meeting in Bali brought the two together for what were generally described as positive talks. According to Biden, the two leaders were “very blunt with one another,” but reports also indicated that they respectively discussed many thorny issues, including Taiwan, technology, trade, and human rights.
That meeting was followed with high-level visits to China by U.S. Secretaries Blinken (June),Yellen(July), andRaimondo(August). Thus, despite the tensions, particularly those tied to more jingoistic stances of some political voices (e.g., candidatesHaley and Ramaswamy), this meeting seems to indicate President’s Xi’s commitment to continuing to develop dialogue with the United States. And these dialogues should not just be ministerial/secretarial and above; the word of the day in China is subnational interaction – business partnerships, cultural events, like the Philadelphia Orchestra visiting China, and subnational political visits, like the mayors from the Midwest visiting China.
A third level of meaning might be Xi’s desire to emphasize China’s appropriate role in the world. As we have written elsewhere, China very likely resents the fact that it has not been given a place in the G7. In the past, we have written about the ways in which the most powerful nations in the world (first the G7 and then, for a while, the G8) have dismissed China (seehere). Despite the fact that China has the second largest economy in the world, and probably the largest military, China has only been given a seat at the children’s table, the G20. China deserves at least membership in a renewed G8, but maybe even aG2(United States and China).
This year has been a big year for China’s leadership on the geopolitical stage. From the brokering and delivery of the Iran-Saudi Arabia peace deal to the rearranging of the BRICS Coalition, China has certainly shown its leadership on the global stage over the last 12 months. It may very well be that Xi is flying the 6,000 miles to emphasize to the world that there are two important countries wielding influence on the global stage today, and the leaders of these countries are talking to each other.
2.Will the Biden administration "say one thing and do another" again this time?
The answer to this question is less about U.S.-China relations and more about the pushes and pulls of US politics. It is our view that President Biden would like for the United States and China to return to a more cooperative and collaborative relationship. For more than a decade, following China’s entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO), US-China ties were oriented toward collaborative economic development and partnership on the geopolitical stage. The tone changed with the rise of protectionist political forces on both sides. Yet, in the post-Trump era, it is essential that China and the U.S. find their way back to a more collaborative relationship. It is our hope, and we believe the hope of the Biden Administration that high-level meetings between the two presidents (Bali 2022, San Francisco 2023) and high-level secretary visits (Blinken, Yellen, Raimondo) will help bring the relationship back to a level of constructive engagement.
Let’s first review the perception that President Biden has in fact “said one thing and done another.” This sense ties back to the meeting between Presidents Xi and Biden in Bali, where it was reported in the Chinese media that Biden had agreed to “four no’s” and one “no-intention.” Quoting China’s earlier State Councilor and Foreign Minister, Wang Yi, the view in China is that, “President Biden has emphasized on multiple occasions that the U.S. does not seek to fight a 'new cold war,' does not seek to change China's political system, does not seek to oppose China via strengthening alliances, does not support Taiwan independence, has no intention to enter into conflict with China…” Wang went on to say, “what we have witnessed is that Team USA appears to have been working with two sets of scores and has failed to turn the political will expressed by their leader into logical policies, which has in turn caused confusion on the part of the Chinese people as well as people of various countries.”
As a result, the strong perception in China is that Biden will say one thing and doing another on these articulated positions. (Natalie Liu, “Did Biden Make Promises to Xi,” VOA, June 27, 2023).
What will happen this time? As the United States speeds into a new election cycle, the results will likely be the same as in Bali. There is strong evidence that Biden would like to lead the country back to the kind of engagement that shaped U.S.-China relations in the years prior to Donald Trump and Peter Navarro. However, turning the four no’s and one no-intention statements into concrete policies is complicated in the US context. The Chinese people would likely hope to see policies that peel back the combative nature of the bipartisan CHIPS Act (“Chips and Science Law”), signed by Biden into law in 2022. The Act is set up to grow the U.S. microchip industry, pouring $52 billion in subsidies to stimulate growth in this industry. At the same time, the U.S. Department of Commerce issued new regulations effectively cutting China off from semiconductor technology developed by U.S. companies. Or the Chinese might like to see U.S. presidential influence over such actions as former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s decision to visit Taiwan. To quote Wang Yi again: “The U.S. side claimed that China is escalating the situation, but the basic facts are that the United States first provoked China on the Taiwan question and blatantly violated China's sovereignty and territorial integrity.” This is the tightrope that Biden walks: He would like to ensure Xi that we are all working together in continuing to build a partnership of constructive engagement, but he must deal with China hawks in both houses of Congress.
Thus, our projection is that Biden will continue to assure Xi of the “four no’s” and one “no-intention.” However, he must still preside over a government he cannot fully control and a conservative wing of the country that he must placate in the coming election year. There will likely be disagreement on this issue, depending on where an observer sits. In China, it will likely be perceived that Biden will again go back on his promises.
For many in the United States, it will be perceived that he has operated within the framework and by continuing longstanding policies in U.S.-China relations, though, given world events, and changing domestic perceptions, the view of these actions may be changing. A case in point is the statement that the U.S. does not support Taiwan independence, even as it continues to sell military arms to Taiwan. This practice has a long and complicated history. In 1979, just four months after the two countries signed the Joint Communique on the Establishment of Diplomatic Relations, Congress passed the Taiwan Relations Act, which mandates that the U.S. “provide Taiwan with arms of a defensive character.” Correctly reading that his veto would be overridden by a two-thirds majority, President Jimmy Carter signed the Act, and it has been law for over 40 years.
One additional political note: As Biden seeks to differentiate and distinguish himself from his potential competitors, besides President Trump, the strongest emerging competitor appears the equally jingoistic Nikki Haley. It may be to Biden’s and the Democratic Party’s advantage to strike the statesmanlike pose of shaking hands and building a stronger relationship with the leader of our most important trading partner.
3.What exactly is China's attitude toward U.S.-China relations?
We believe the Chinese attitude toward U.S.-China relations is quite negative. The rift between our nations has probably been growing for a decade, but the explicit downturn began with the policies and stances that came out under the Trump-Navarro regime. Since that time, Biden has sought to repair the relationship, however, he is also dealing with a fractured electorate that he does not control. Ultimately, as we have noted above and in previous posts, China would like to be treated with respect and taken seriously as a peer and partner. The Biden Administration has taken steps toward repairing the damage that has been done in the last seven years, but China’s view is that it is not enough. As we noted in the answer to question 1, it is a notable and important signal that Xi is traveling to San Francisco for the meeting with Biden. The view in China is that there is still significant work to do in repairing this relationship.
4.Does the summit mean a turning point in the relationship between the two countries?
It is our hope that the summit will become a turning point in the relationship between the two countries. We have noted that Xi is sending a strong signal in choosing to travel to the United States for the APEC meeting, and to specifically meet with President Biden. The fact that this meeting comes in the wake of several high-level visits of US Cabinet secretaries to China, it seems that both sides are working hard to send the signals of constructive and cooperative engagement. Both leaders will need to control the messaging emerging from their respective institutions through social media and talking points.
This has been a very powerful year for China in playing a leadership role on the global stage. Beyond the size and power of the economy, there have been the deals brokered – Iran and Saudi Arabia – and leadership in reconstituting the BRICS Coalition and, more generally, leadership in the economic development of the Global South. China’s success in these areas has made it clear that it must be taken seriously as a major player on the geopolitical stage. And, in this context, Xi is sending a powerful signal by coming to the United States to meet with Biden another time. It feels to us that the stars are aligning for this summit to be a turning point in the currently chilly relationship between the two countries.
