### Global Citizens, Everyday Leaders

31 March 2022|Creative Leadership, Leadership
AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy. Several of us have advised companies and taught about leadership over theyears, and we have developed atheoryof leadership that takes us away from the charismatic leader to the person on the ground fighting for theteam, community,family, or evenyoung adolescent leaders. We have also written a significant amount abouteveryday leadershipandcreative leadership. In this post, we seek to continue our advancement of a view of Everyday Leadership from a personal perspective with a new piece by OGL contributor Will Sweeney-Samuelson. – The Editorial Team

There was a globe in my kindergarten classroom. It was a raised relief globe, with real peaks and valleys approximating the surface of the earth as we understand it. I have a distinct memory of running my fingertips over those contours, and of closing my eyes and imagining the landscape underneath them, and the people, the animals, the sounds, and smells that could exist there. It was amazing to me that there were places on the other side of the world, with interesting names likeDushanbeandAddis Ababa, where people lived and spoke and ate differently from me. What does their backyard look like? Do they have a golden retriever, like my family? These simple thoughts were endlessly entertaining. In a naive way, I wanted to witness their lives and hear their stories.
Much later, I discovered the term “global citizenship”. I found the concept to be both humanitarian and adventurous. I still do. It became a goal, of sorts. In the many years following those daydreams, I have tried to explore this basic desire in my personal and professional lives. I travel as much as I can and have lived and worked abroad. This has given me unforgettable memories of wading through thegilets jaunesprotests in France, and of feeling the palpable tensions in Ukraine leading up to the 2014 coup. It has also given me countless personal moments I cherish: a night spent dancing to frenetic drum music at a traditional summer festival in Tokyo, a bright morning laughing with my students while we watched helplessly as a troop of monkeys stole from our rural school’s vegetable garden, the small Shinto shrine near my apartment that I’ve promised myself I’ll revisit someday. I’ve learned from each experience, and have tried t become a better global citizen through them.
But what does this really mean? Some of my less pleasant experiences confirmed the universal truth that we all tend to learn the hard way: the world can be a big, complicated, difficult place. Travel abroad can be exhausting, or dangerous. Working in an unfamiliar country can trigger extreme culture shock, as the stress of new cultural expectations compound the stress of work responsibilities. Leaving tourism behind to engage inlifein another country is simply very difficult. Cultural divides, xenophobia, and racism are alive and well today—everywhere. In essence, global citizenship, with all its attendant joys and responsibilities, is a complicated endeavor that few in the world have the opportunity to consider. Ultimately, it could prove to be an impossible task, the cultural divides between us being too far to bridge. Considering these challenges, why indulge in this exercise? Is global citizenship just a daydream, a feel-good indulgence for those of us fortunate enough to have the means to travel?
These questions are moot, in a sense. Our future is global. The central issues we all face are both international and intercultural; therefore the success of good ideas – and the businesses built on them – relies upon more than just the cooperation of diverse cultures and nations. We are in the third decade of the 21st century, and the challenges it brings give shape to a new era, whether we are prepared for it or not. One thing is clear: The world of 2022 does not benefit from the answers provided by the 20th century. Climate change, population hyper density, and workforce automation are not problems that can be solved regionally and facing backward. These issues and others must be addressed by all of us at once, without regard to nation, culture, or language. For those of us who are young enough that their careers, health, and stability will be guided by these global forces, our ability or inability to prepare for the changes ahead is an urgent concern.
The pandemic is an example of the modern adversities that face all nations equally and is proof that our world is deeply interconnected, even if we pretend it’s not. The war in Ukraine reminded some of us in the west that regional conflicts can still threaten us all. They have not disappeared into history. Our problems are universal, while our decision-making structures are fractured and siloed by language, culture, and socio-economic status. I believe that those with the creativity, compassion, and knowledge to think from diverse perspectives, and inhabit others’ cultural outlooks, will be the designers of our new era. This is because the challenges we face require it.
Perhaps a good working definition of the perfect global citizen is someone who can thrive in any culture, in any situation. I certainly cannot claim that expertise, and it is very likely that I never will. More than anything, my handful of international experiences showed me, one mistake at a time, how far away I am from this goal I have set for myself. However, the mistakes made the path forward clearer to me – and I believe a series of skills can make the road easier to travel. First, above all, humility. Accepting and engaging with complexity. Practicing the art of listening carefully to every voice in the room. Introspection, flexibility, creative thinking – all good traits to have at the ready. Living abroad, these were the skills I found myself employing and developing every day, not in idle free time, but rigorously, in a marathon setting, because these “soft” skills were the ropes holding my life together.
These skills, the components of the everyday leader, have continued to enrich my life after I returned home to the United States to join Thunderbird school of Global Management as a graduate student. They are simple and universal. These attributes have proven to be effective in the business world when applied at any level, by anyone. The complex world we live in requires global minds that are both compassionate and flexible. My experience has convinced me that cultivating these virtues pays dividends both in my personal life and within organizations.
The globe I remember from my childhood classroom is most likely buried in a landfill, crushed beyond recognition. It is a relic of the 20th century as much as our quaint views of borders in a technological age. Even in its glory days, the globe could only show us where to go, not what to do once we got there. That’s our responsibility.

He has traveled to 26 countries, notably France, where he lived for six months, and Japan, where he lived for two years. As a current graduate student at Thunderbird School of Global Management, he was recently given the opportunity to travel to Brussels, Belgium, where he worked as a student consultant for the city’s economic development agency, hub.brussels. Prior to enrolling at Thunderbird, Will was a professional craftsman and a teacher. Most recently, he led teams of glassblowers in a major production glass studio in Seattle, Wash., and has taught advanced glass blowing courses at two separate art centers.
