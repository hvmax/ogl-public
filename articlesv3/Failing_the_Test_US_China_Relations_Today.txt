### Failing the Test: U.S.-China Relations Today

21 February 2023|China, China politics, Geopolitics
AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy and, in particular, life in China. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. We have written about economic development in China and China’s economic reforms, U.S.-China relations, China’s changing role in the global political economy, and the history and current state of Chinese politics. In this post, over a week since the United States shot down the Chinese balloon, we focus on the state of U.S.-China relations today. We have written about the balloon incidenthere. And we have written about the state of U.S.-China relations, see, e.g.,here,here,here, andhere. Our view is that these two superpowers are testing each other, and both sides are playing a dangerous game.
As the Chinese surveillance balloon floated over the United States before being shot down on February 5, the world, and especially the United States, was transfixed, and wondering how this event might impact on US-China relations. They got their answer immediately: On February 4, the Biden Administration cancelled (“postponed”) Secretary of State Antony Blinken’s trip to China, which was originally scheduled for February 5-6.
Virtually every geopolitical pundit and major publication has expressed opinions over the issue and continue to do so (e.g.,here). We would like to offer a few thoughts on the incident (beyond what we have writtenhere) and then link this discussion to the broader state of U.S.-China relations, particularly in the area of the interdependence of the world’s two largest economies.
If China and the United States were testing each other in this current incident,bothcountries failed. Yes,both. Let's say China purposely sent up a surveillance balloon just a week before Secretary Blinken’s visit to see what the response would be from the U.S. A unique former of diplomacy but an interesting test. As many pundits and public servants have noted, superpowers track and gather intelligence about their counterparts often and always. Indeed, in this case, it has been reported that the U.S. was tracking the balloon from itslaunchat Hainan Island. So, surely China would have known this act would not go unnoticed, and would certainly be a move that would disrupt relations and not foster engagement. It's likely if the U.S. had floated a balloon over China's sovereign territory that its reaction would have been somewhat similar.
We do have to consider that, perhaps, the leadership in Beijing knew exactly what it was doing and what the response might be. But, again, if this is the case, the Chinese made a grave error in pushing the boundaries of its already tense relationship with its largest trading partner, especially on the eve of an important high-level meeting. We deliver a failing grade to China on its approach.
From the other side, the United States undoubtedly failed this test as well. If China was doing something brash and bold in launching “Balloon-Gate” to test the U.S. diplomatic reaction, then it seriously failed the exam. Blinken cancelled his trip to China, postponing a meeting with President Xi Jinping himself, and losing the chance to choose engagement in the midst of heightening tensions between the two superpowers.

Blinken is aiming for a reasonable but firm posture, arguing that the two countries must be in dialogue over their respective roles in the world. With the balloon behind them, Blinken and China's top diplomat Wang Yi met in Munich for an unscheduled meeting, with the Chinese diplomat calling the U.S.'s behavior absurd and hysterical over the balloon.
Blinken was more measured. In a recent appearance on the TV news program, “Meet the Press,” Blinken said he encouraged open lines of communication with Wang. "This is something that the world expects of us – they expect us to manage this relationship responsibly, and so it was important that we had that opportunity this evening here in Munich," he said.
Blinken did also rattle the U.S. saber somewhat in a separate appearance onThis Week with George Stephanopoulos: “We had a very direct, very clear conversation about the Chinese surveillance balloon being sent over our territory in violation of our sovereignty in violation of international law. I told Wang Yi, my Chinese counterpart, that that action was unacceptable, and that action must never happen again.”
Blinken went on to reinforce what President Biden has said about the U.S.-China relationship. “We seek competition, not conflict with China,” he said, harkening back to a statement from Biden “Asia Tsar” Kurt Campbell, who noted that the era of engagement with China was over and would be replaced with a new era of competition.
Given the current status of U.S.-China relations, Blinkenshouldhave moved forward with his China visit and had an opportune moment with President Xi to reaffirm the importance of diplomatic engagement, communication, and cooperation, and diplomatically, but firmly, discuss the implications of the spy balloon incident. It could have been a meeting in which – engaging at the highest levels – serious and firm points would have been made.
Analysts agree about the importance of communication and cooperation between these two countries, ensuring they could have had a chance to “hug it out,” so to speak. Instead the United States was dressed down by Wang Yi in Munich. In our view, the United States failed this exam. (It goes without saying that Wang Yi won zero new friends in the United States with his condescending and dismissive comments, not the most impressive example of diplomacy.)

To be fair, some high-ranking China observers have been a little more balanced than those hawks in Congress, many of whom feel a threat from China and its growing economy. For example, former Ambassador to China and former Montana Sen. Max Baucus, in an interview withPolitico’sDeep Dive,has been critical of both Republicans and Democrats in Washington when it comes to U.S. relations with China.
“Neither country is going away. We have to deal with each other,” he said. “If I were still in the Senate, and still chairing the Senate Finance Committee, I’d be holding exhaustive hearings on China, on all the different ramifications, not just security, trade, tax, human rights, and do it objectively.”
The former ambassador noted that he thought it was a mistake for Blinken to cancel his trip to China, though he conceded that he probably had no choice due to the political climate in the United States. The handling of the balloon has proven to be a contentious issue with Republicans in Congress, many of whom didn't believe China's weak cover story of a weather balloon gone astray. In fact, they wanted the balloon shot down over Montana despite the raining debris it would create.
Baucus urged caution and patient, and he was eloquent about how mutual understanding between American and Chinese citizens is a benefit for both countries. He also noted “in China, it’s kind of corny, but I learned what I call my Three Ps. That is, with the Chinese, you’ve got to be patient, you’ve got to be positive, and you’ve got to be persistent. Stick with it, stick with the issue in a positive way, and, more often than not, you make progress, whatever issue it might be. And there are tons of issues.”
Baucus ended the interview warning about conflict and noting our interdependence: “It is highly unlikely there will be a military confrontation with China. Highly unlikely, because the consequences are just too dire," he said. "I hope that, now that China has repealed Zero-COVID precautions, that there will be a lot more travel and communications with China. The more Americans visit China and spend time over there; and the more Chinese visit the United States and spend time in our country, the better off we’re going to be. Because ignorance breeds fear, and so few Americans have been to China, and they don’t know anything about China, and so they’re fearful because they’re ignorant… And to be honest, many in the Administration who are calling the shots haven’tbeento China. They think they’re experts, and it’s easy to criticize, but they haven’t been to China.”
It was a very thoughtful and, in some ways, remarkable interview living in today’s climate, and we long for a return of such reasonable and open minds to the hallowed halls of power in the United States and in China. (And we recommend listening to the interviewhere.)
Let us close by picking up on Baucus’ assertion that a military confrontation with China is “highly unlikely, because the consequences are just too dire.” In our writing, we have made this point in a number of areas, but we will focus here on the economic interdependence of the world’s two largest economies. Given the absolute dependence of many U.S. and western companies on China’s manufacturing supply chain, a conflict with China would be catastrophic for so many American companies, from Apple to Tesla to Wal-Mart, and many others. We have been called on to talk about these issues over the years (see, e.g.,here,here,here,here), so we are not saying anything different from what we have said previously.
However, we would like to emphasize the point in the strongest terms: Many key players – from former President Trump to technology business pundit Scott Galloway toThe Washington Post– have weighed in on the idea that companies like Apple should simply diversify production to other nations around the globe. Recently, there has been a lot of applause about Foxconn’s decision to build a factory in India. What's at stake? India opens its doors, and suddenly the United States’ China dependence is resolved. Not even close to reality.
To be clear, this is simply not how production in China works. The companies that are dependent on China are not simply dependent on China for final assembly factories (Foxconn is only final assembly for Apple). Companies with complex products (e.g., iPhones and cars) are dependent upon China's muscular supply chain or the flow of goods – elements, components, modules – that filter down into the final assembly plants. Apple, for example, works with more than 1,000 different suppliers in China. In our estimation, it would take years, perhaps even decades, to build a supply chain in India that would operate as efficiently as that in China. If U.S.-China relations escalated to the point of a military threat, the Chinese government could make production difficult for companies like Apple and Tesla, the economic consequences would be substantial.
Some pundits will counter that both countries will be hurt by a détente that affects the manufacturing of and the flow of goods. This is certainly true. But the issue that is most often cited – the trade imbalance and the excess amount of money flowing to China via the imbalance – is misunderstood. A large portion of the goods flowing to the U.S. captured in the trade imbalance, which was about $350 Billion in 2021, is captured by U.S. companies exporting their made-in-China goods to be sold in the United States. The majority of goods captured in the U.S.-China trade imbalance are products made in China to be sold in the United States. Indeed, the single largest exporter from China to the United States is Wal-Mart. Apple and other U.S. companies rank high on this list (though exact rankings are difficult to come by).
A true trade war will hurt both countries, but it will hurt these countries differently. In China, it will hurt the poorest part of the population, the migrant labor force (the floating population [流动人口]). In the United States, it will hit the corporate sector the hardest. This might be preferred for the populists in the U.S., especially in the post-Trump era. Imagine a trade war in which corporate profits take a massive hit and suddenly Americans’ 401k accounts take a massive hit. The first to feel it will be the 40% of Americans with 401ks and the economic oracles on Wall Street, which will be crying for compromise. Eventually, the follow-on effects of such a trade skirmish would touch everyone as the world economy responds to the crisis.
In sum, the United States and Chinese economies are profoundly interdependent, and both countries would be devastated by a continued escalation of tensions. So, let’s dial back the furor over spy balloons. Let’s stop jabbing the U.S. to “test” its mettle. Let’s get back to a policy of real engagement.
