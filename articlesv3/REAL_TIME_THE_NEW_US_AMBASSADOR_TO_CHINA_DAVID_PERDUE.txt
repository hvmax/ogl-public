2 May 2025|China, China politics, Geopolitics, Realtime
At On Global Leadership, we write often about the role of U.S. political decisions on US-China relations. We have written about debates (here,here), trade wars (here,here,here), and geopolitical tensions (e.g., the controversary over China’s presence in the Panama Canal, see, e.g.,here). And we have written about the roles of various personalities in these discussions, for example, the roles of Steve Bannon and Elon Musk (see, e.g.,hereandhere). In this post, we focus on the critical appointment of David Perdue as Ambassador to China. Answers to the OGL RealTime questions are below.
On April 29, the U.S. Senate has confirmed former Georgia Senator David Perdue as ambassador to China, a pivotal role amid rising trade tensions with Beijing. Nominated by President Trump in December 2024, Perdue, once branded "anti-China" by a Chinese think tank during his time in Congress, joins a cohort of China hawks in the administration. The 75-year-old former businessman was confirmed by a 67–29 vote on April 29. The previous ambassador was career diplomat Nicholas Burns.
Can you tell us something about David Perdue who was confirmed as the U.S. Ambassador to China?
David Perdue brings a blend of corporate leadership and political experience to one of America's most pivotal diplomatic roles. His appointment comes at a time of heightened U.S.-China tensions, marked by escalating trade disputes and strategic rivalry.​
Born on December 10, 1949, in Georgia, Perdue earned both bachelor's and master's degrees from the Georgia Institute of Technology. He began his career as a management consultant before executive roles at major corporations, including Reebok, Sara Lee, and Dollar General. Notably, during his tenure at Sara Lee, he oversaw operations in Asia, including China and Hong Kong, which involved sourcing suppliers and expanding international production. ​
Perdue won the U.S. Senate seat representing Georgia in 2014. Perdue lost his seat in the general election to Democrat Jon Ossoff in 2020, before trying unsuccessfully to unseat fellow Republican Brian Kemp in 2022, for governor. Throughout his political career, Perdue aligned closely with President Trump, supporting his policies and, at times, his contested claims regarding electoral processes.
In 2024, Perdue wrote a long, and some would argue overwrought, essay about China and its strategic planning for its future. What can be learned about him from that?
In the September 2024essay in theWashington Examiner,Perdue expressed a deep distrust of Marxism, socialism, and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), portraying them as inherently dangerous and oppressive. The repeated references to “failed Marxist states” (e.g., Cuba, North Korea, Venezuela) and historical atrocities under Mao signal a belief that communism is ideologically and morally bankrupt.
“Our fight is not with the people of China but with the CCP. Only 6% of the population are members of the CCP. How do the other 94% feel about living in an authoritarian state? Well, in 1989, at Tiananmen Square, they let the world know exactly how they felt: They wanted freedom,” he wrote. “Today, with China’s social credit score system, millions of public cameras, and facial recognition software, another Tiananmen seems unlikely. Who would have believed a few years ago that one of the wealthiest entrepreneurs in the world, who started Alibaba, would go missing mysteriously for three months after displeasing the CCP? This is the future the CCP plans for the rest of the world.”
A reference to the “U.S.-led world order” originating from Bretton Woods, and the concern over China seeking to replace it, reflects Perdue’s belief in the superiority of maintaining U.S. global leadership and a liberal international system. There’s an implicit warning that the alternative — a world shaped by China’s values — would be authoritarian and repressive.
Terms like “modern-day emperor,” “convert the world to Marxism,” and “perfect allocation of misery” indicate Perdue’s rhetorical intent to both alarm and persuade. This is not neutral analysis; it's a political and ideological warning framed in stark, moralistic terms.
Perdue framed the current global contest as ideological — democracy vs. authoritarianism, freedom vs. control — drawing on Cold War language and historical analogies (e.g., Tiananmen, Marx, Mao, Churchill). This framing suggests a belief that the U.S. is in an existential competition with China, not just a geopolitical rivalry. The text frequently references familiar figures (Churchill, Deng Xiaoping, Jack Ma) and American cultural/political values (freedom, capitalism, democracy). It seems written to rally public and political support for a tougher stance on China.
“Democratic countries have to decide what they will do to protect democracy in Taiwan,” he wrote. “Our ‘strategic ambiguity’ policy needs to be addressed with allies and clarified. Going the way of Hong Kong, where China lied about “one country, two systems” and now extradites residents to mainland China at will, should be unacceptable.
What did we learn about Perdue during his confirmation hearing?
Perdue views China as a significant strategic competitor to the United States. In a 2018 op-ed co-authored with fellow Republican senators, he emphasized the need for a long-term plan to address China's rising economic and geopolitical influence, warning against complacency and outdated perceptions.
In his testimony before the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee (April 3, 2025), Perdue laid out his expectations of his role as ambassador and carrying forward Trump administration policy:
●  “As Ambassador, I will support our strategy to lead with diplomacy to ensure our own national and economic security remains uncompromised. I will remain committed to promoting democratic ideals and an open, free, and fair international system.
●  As Ambassador, I will support the United States’ one China policy, guided by the Taiwan Relations Act, the three Joint Communiques, and the Six Assurances. We remain committed to a peaceful resolution that is acceptable to the people on both sides of the Strait. We oppose unilateral changes to the status quo.
●  “As Ambassador, I will ardently communicate our objections to China’s penetration into our power grid, our ports, and our personal lives. Having participated in U.S. FONOP exercises in the South China Sea, I’ve seen first-hand China’s militarization and will work to support open and free navigation wherever international law allows.
●  I will also ensure focus on our priority to eliminate fentanyl precursors and hold China accountable on human rights. I will work to increase the tempo of diplomatic dialogue to get results and to achieve fair and reciprocal trade between our two economies.”
During his Senate tenure, Perdue advocated for a robust U.S. naval presence to counter threats, including those from China. His stance reflects a broader perspective that sees China's government as a challenge to U.S. interests, particularly in areas like trade, technology, and regional security. ​
Perdue is expected to follow Trump’s lead on China policy, and adopt a similar anti-China stance. “Marxist nationalism is reshaping China, and their global ambitions threaten the current world,” noted Perdue in his testimony. “Their Belt and Road Initiative and their Made in China 2025 statements demonstrate their global ambitions. They speak of a global “community of common destiny for all mankind.”
Will Perdue’s business background make him more amenable to pressing forward a reduction in the sky-high tariffs against China-made goods?
Perdue's business background includes experience with outsourcing and international operations, particularly in Asia.While this history has drawn criticism, especially concerning job losses in the U.S., Perdue has defended these practices as necessary business decisions. Many are hoping that this pro-business philosophy will guide him through any trade negotiations with China.
As a senator, he initially expressed reservations about broad tariffs but later supported measures aimed at protecting American industries. His alignment with Trump's "America First" economic policies suggests a willingness to use tariffs and other tools to address trade imbalances and protect national interests. ​
Perdue's confirmation as ambassador comes amid a significant trade dispute, with the U.S. imposing 145% tariffs on Chinese goods and China responding with 125% tariffs on U.S. products.  Despite these tensions, Perdue has emphasized the importance of a strategic, nonpartisan approach to U.S.-China relations, recognizing the complexities and the need for engagement on shared interests. ​
His role will involve navigating a range of issues, from trade and economic policies to security concerns and technological competition, all while maintaining open lines of communication between the two nations.​ This approach is necessary given the friction that has developed thanks to the tariffs.
What are Perdue's biggest challenges moving forward?
As ambassador, Perdue faces the challenge of managing a multifaceted relationship with China, marked by competition and interdependence. His business acumen and political experience will be crucial in addressing ongoing trade disputes and fostering dialogue.
It will be an uphill battle. "Let me make it clear one more time that China and the U.S. are not engaged in any consultation or negotiation on tariffs," Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun said at a news conference this week.
Observers will be watching closely to see how he balances assertiveness with diplomacy in this critical role in relation to the tariff debacle unfolding today. China has shown a remarkable reluctance to concede ground to Trump on the tariffs. If he hopes to influence the discussion, Perdue will need to help find a face-saving answer that not only appeases China but also his boss.
