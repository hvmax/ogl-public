Editorial Note: Here atOn Global Leadership, we seek to bring a political economic lens to issues of the day with a boots-on-the-ground perspective of how an issue is actually playing out in China. In this post, we present our own translation of an April 2020 paper by well-known Chinese Professor Wang Jisi(王缉思),who is the dean of the School of International Relations at Peking University. A former Brookings Institution fellow, Wang is a influential scholar who has a deep knowledge of the complex economic, political, and cultural relationship between China and the United States.

1.  Changes in U.S. policy towards China
The new trend of US policy towards China can be traced back to 2017, when major changes took place after the Trump administration. From personal observation, China-US relations have been developing in a bad direction since 2009. That is, the relationship between China and the United States began to change course during the Obama administration, though not as dramatically as it did under Trump. Issues in China-US relations today, include: trade frictions, Hong Kong, Taiwan, human rights, the South China Sea, technological decoupling and intellectual property rights protections, all began before Trump came to power in 2017.
Trump's phone call to Taiwan's leader Tsai Ing-wen before he took office sparked opposition from many in the US and an outcry from China. Since taking office, Trump has not done too many bad things on the Taiwan issue. Instead, he has focused on trade relations with China to correct the trade surplus. That fits with Trump's own administration, which has focused on reviving the US economy and making America great again.
Trump and his Secretaries of the State and Defense and other advisers around him have identified China as their main strategic rival, a strategic "competitor" and a so-called "revisionist state". "Revisionist country" means that China wants to fix the current international order and is dissatisfied with the US-dominated international order. Then, the United States claims to be competing with China in an all-government, long-term strategic competition.
The first major event of the Trump administration was trade friction with China, which turned into a trade war. The trade war ended earlier this year when China and the United States reached the first phase of a trade agreement. The main elements of the agreement are for China to buy $200 billion worth of US goods over the next two years, including oil and gas, agricultural products, manufactured goods and financial services, as well as improving intellectual property protection, ending forced technology transfers and loosening currency controls.
Trump originally intended to hold the second stage of trade talks after the US presidential election in November this year. However, both China and the US have suffered seriously from the epidemic, and the timing and outcome of the second stage of trade talks will become more uncertain. That is to say, the trade dispute between China and the United States has been suspended for a while, but the issue has not been completely resolved. The United States has not removed many of the tariffs it imposed on China before the signing of the phase one of the agreement.
The second stage is supposed to focus on subsidies for Chinese state-owned enterprises, market access, foreign investment review, and cyber security.
With the outbreak of coronavirus in January this year, China had hoped for more cooperation between the two countries to fight COVID-19.
Strategically, the United States continues to put pressure on China. During his recent visit to India, Trump made a veiled criticism of China and issued a joint statement with Indian’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi, saying that he would strengthen strategic integration in the Indo-Pacific region and establish a meaningful code of conduct in the South China Sea to support tourism, navigation and security, which is also clearly aimed at China. The United States is also trying to reduce China's influence in the United Nations and other bodies. For example, the United States recently successfully blocked a Chinese representative's nomination to head the world intellectual property organization. In early February, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the National Governors Association that U.S.-China competition is not only a matter for the federal government, but also for individual states. He called on states to follow the instructions of the federal government and be more vigilant about China.
In the wake of the outbreak, the US government's attitude toward China has been both erratic and inconsistent. Trump initially praised China's transparency in its fight against the disease, while Vice President Mike Pence said China and the United States are cooperating. In his speech, Trump directly referred to COVID-19 as the "China virus", refuting claims that the US military had transmitted the virus to China. Now, the United States has said a lot of bad things about China, even about the outbreak.
Still, there has been some cooperation between China and the United States. The U.S. Center for Disease Control joined the World Health Organization’s expert delegation to a field visit to China.(Translator’s note: Cliff Lane, researcher with the National Institute of  Health's Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, was one of the WHO expert team in China in February.)
In a word, the current diplomatic information between China and the United States is rather confused. The overall relationship between the two countries has not improved by the outbreak of Covid-19, but worsened.
In the future, the Trump administration and the U.S. Congress will continue to introduce new policies and measures, strengthen coordination among departments and exert all-round pressure on China in trade relations, technological competition, cyber security, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Tibet, Xinjiang, and many other issues.
On trade relations, at the end of February amid epidemic, the US Trade Representative's office exempted the tariffs on imports from China of PPE such as masks, medical glove and other medical products. This was a good thing for China. But later the United States found it also has to import medicines and pharmaceutical raw materials, and other medical equipment from China. It felt very uncomfortable; the US became worried about these strategic supplies would be subject to China’s control. To further detach from China, the US has decided to bring back the production or purchase from other parts of the world, in order to reduce the dependency on China for medical products and medicine.
On the technology front, the crackdown on Huawei continues. (Deputy Chairwoman of the Huawei Board and Chief Financial Officer) Meng Wanzhou is still in Canada, and the United States wants to bring her to the United States for trial. The United States has used diplomatic, judicial, and administrative means to suppress and boycott Huawei, and senior officials of the Trump administration have on many occasions, such as at the Munich security conference, stressed the harm of Huawei to national security and democratic political system, in an attempt to block the use of Huawei equipment in 5G network construction by western allies such as the United Kingdom. The United States is also exploring ways to foster its own 5G industry, and new rules from the Treasury Department to increase scrutiny of overseas investors recently took effect. There are also a number of coordinated policies aimed at preventing US technology from being used as a tool to help China strengthen its surveillance and military capabilities.
On the Taiwan issue, the United States has also been active. When Tsai was re-elected as Taiwan's leader in January, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo issued a statement congratulating Tsai on her re-election, acknowledging her leadership in the US-Taiwan tie and in Taiwan Strait relationship. And reaffirmed the US and Taiwan share the common value. In the wake of COVID-19, the United States proposed it should at least allow Taiwan to participate as an observer in meetings of the World Health Organization in an attempt to improve Taiwan's international standing.
On the South China Sea issue, the United States is still exerting pressure. Not only does the United States have its Navy surveillance aircraft flying over the South China Sea, but it also wants to strengthen its Indo-Pacific strategy and encourages Vietnam, the Philippines, and other countries that have disputes with China in the South China Sea to put new pressure on China.
On Hong Kong, the United States Congress last year passed the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act in an attempt to interfere in China's internal affairs and nominated the Hong Kong democracy movement for the 2020 Nobel peace prize.(Translator's note: A dozen members of the U.S. Congress nominated Hong Kong’s pro-democracy movement and one of its student leaders for the prize.)
On the issue of Tibet, the United States passed the Tibet Policy and Support Act of 2019, openly interfering in China's internal affairs, especially regarding the future succession of the 15th Dalai Lama, the leader of Tibetan Buddhism, encouraging the decision to ignore the Chinese government and leave it to the Tibetans themselves.
On people-to-people exchanges, there has been much surveillance of Chinese students in the United States, and a Harvard chemistry professor has been charged by the FBI. On Feb. 18, the State Department also included five Chinese media outlets -- Xinhua News Agency, China Radio and Television International, China Global Television Network, China Daily and People's Daily -- in the scope of the Foreign Missions Act, which equates them with representatives of the Chinese government and restricts their activities. China countered on Feb. 19 by revoking the press cards of three foreign journalists withThe Wall Street Journal. The State Department further requested on March 2 that the five Chinese news organizations reduce their total number of Chinese employees in the United States to no more than 100 and submit detailed lists by March 6. To counteract, China revoked all the foreign press cards fromThe Wall Street Journal, The New York Times,andThe Washington Post.
Some of the US think tanks and media agents have published reports, papers, and comments on China policy, which echo the US policy towards China and even call on the US government to adopt a stronger policy towards China. A number of presidential candidates have also made China-bashing remarks. (Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe) Biden even went so far as to say if he was elected, he would take very tough measures against China, especially by strengthening the alliance with the US to deal with China. That means the United States is trying to rally allies and partners to contain China's international influence.
China will also be a more prominent issue in this year's US election than in the past. Of course, the election is still focused on domestic issues, including slow economic growth, a looming financial crisis, and traditional issues such as social inequality, immigration, health care, and education, rather than foreign affairs. But when it comes to foreign relations, China is at the top of the list.
There are conflicting opinions about who will be elected president of the United States. Until March 2020, the US economy was in good shape, and the polls favored the Trump campaign. Now with the outbreak in the United States, the pressure on Trump is intense, and as the number of infections and deaths increases, his own attitude toward the outbreak has changed significantly. The opposition criticized him for this. The governor of New York criticized Trump for using the term "China virus" as an irresponsible term. He said many Chinese, Chinese descendants, and Asians in New York state have been subjected to racial discrimination. As the outbreak progresses, there will be more pressure on Trump. While Trump has no rivals in the Republican Party, he will have a run against Democrat Joe Biden.
Who is better for China? I think each has its own advantages and disadvantages.
If Trump is re-elected, he will continue to exert pressure on China on the issue of trade. Moreover, none of the aides around Trump has a favorable attitude towards China, and the anti-China forces of the FBI, CIA, and other state agencies are also very strong. While Trump praises China for doing a good job and claims to be good friends with the Chinese president, he has not done China any good. For China, Trump's re-election is sure to bring many more bad policies. In 2017, Trump issued an anti-China policy paper as soon as he took office. The good part is that in the past few years, Trump has mainly engaged China on economic and trade issues, paid little attention to the South China Sea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, human rights, Xinjiang, and other issues, and even suppressed extreme anti-China forces, and proposed to deal with economic and trade issues before solving other issues.
If Biden takes office, he may go further than Trump on China's internal affairs, the South China Sea, and international issues, and in particular may well rally other countries to counter the alleged Chinese threat. But on the plus side, Biden has a long history with China, knows more about us than Trump, and doesn't see us as the biggest threat to the United States. In addition, Biden is surrounded by many of the same diplomats who served in the Obama administration and know more about China than the Trump team.
In a word, whoever is elected as the US president has both advantages and disadvantages for China, but overall relationship with China is not good. The US government's continuously intensifying competitive strategy towards China, coupled with the negative impression in the US of both parties towards China, all make it difficult for us to be optimistic about the US policy towards China in the next a few years.
2.  China's policy and attitude towards the U.S.
This year, on March 16, the member of the Political Bureau of the CCP and the director of the central office of foreign affairs committee Yang Jie-chi spoke with the American secretary of state on the phone. Yang told Pompeo some American politicians constantly vilified China and on the virus prevention and control efforts, putting stigma to China. And it aroused the Chinese people's strong indignation. China firmly opposes and strongly denounces it. The Chinese side told the US that any attempt to discredit and defame China will never succeed, and that any act that undermines China's interests will be met with firm retaliation. China urges the United States to strengthen communication and cooperation with China and the international community to jointly safeguard international public health security in the light of common interest and aspirations of the Chinese and American people and the people of other countries in the world. Pompeo said the US was deeply dissatisfied with China's accusations that the US military had spread the virus and stigmatized the US. In fact, both sides had a very unpleasant phone call, accusing each other of damaging China-US relations and their own national interests.
In the past two years, especially during the new epidemic outbreak, the attitude of the Chinese government, think tanks, media, and public opinion towards the United States had changed significantly. For a long time, the relationship between China and the United States was seen as a top priority that should be kept under the radar. Now, these views have faded from the mainstream platforms of public opinion. Instead, some say China should confront the United States and dare to show its “sword.“ Writings and various online videos and articles have even shown disappointment of the United States and no longer have a hope for future of cooperation.
In terms of publicity, it has become a positive energy and themes to carry forward Chinese culture, spread the successful experience of China's governance, and enhance the confidence of China to lead the world with its solutions. For example, China's performance during this outbreak has been generally evaluated as very successful by the mainstream propaganda, saying that China has set a benchmark for the world, and has begun to support countries around the world, including Italy and Pakistan.
For some time now, the Chinese government and the Chinese people have become much less tolerant of America's anti-China words and deeds. For example, in December, when Daryl Morey, general manager of the NBA (Houston) Rockets, posted inappropriate comments on social media, we imposed sanctions by canceling the broadcasting of many NBA programs. In February, China responded to the US decision to include five Chinese media outlets in the diplomatic missions act by revoking the press cards of three journalists fromThe Wall Street Journalbased in Beijing. As to “China virus”, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian quoted the head of the US CDC as saying there were early cases in the US, and the United States owed China an explanation.
The handling of such incidents is likely to become a model that no longer tolerates US attacks on China. The fight of information, public opinion, and diplomacy between China and the United States is becoming increasingly fierce. It is becoming an irreversible inertia.
In terms of economic, technological, and people-to-people exchanges, both China and the United States are reducing their dependencies on each other. China has placed greater emphasis on independent innovation in trade, investment, finance, and technology. We do not want to see decoupling in our trade and technology, but we are making both mental and material preparations for this. The products China needs, whether being 5G, aero engines, or anything else, should be made by China itself. Americans are wary, too. For example, the United States now imports a lot of Chinese medical products and medicines, and wants to reduce its dependence on China.
During the outbreak, the Foreign Ministry spokesperson also severely criticized the US for being the first to withdraw its diplomatic and consular staff from China and the first to impose comprehensive restrictions on Chinese citizens, creating fear and influencing others. In view of the US attitude and measures, the Chinese Ministry of Culture and Tourism on Feb. 24 warned Chinese tourists against visiting the US. Such is the level of mutual antipathy between China and the United States.
On the whole, the Chinese public distrusts and dislikes the United States to a degree not seen in the 41 years of diplomatic relations between China and the United States.
At the same time, China-Russia relations have been upgraded to a comprehensive strategic partnership of cooperation in the new era, and the political mutual trust between the two sides has reached an unprecedented height. China has also attached greater importance to its relations with developing countries, re-established the concept of an "international united front", and intensified its efforts in the work of the United Nations and its affiliated bodies, such as the World Health Organization. China has played a leading role in international mechanisms without the United States, such as the BRICs (Brazil, Russia, India, and China), the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, and BRI (Belt and Road Initiative), etc.
All this shows that the US has made a great turn in its China policy. China clearly understood it, and made corresponding adjustments in its strategy, approach, and specific policies. The direction is to compete and fight more resolutely. In general, China has stressed the necessity to abandon illusions about the United States and be prepared to face stormy challenges.
The diplomatic approach has so far maintained a conciliatory stance towards the US, insisting on "advancing China-US relations based on coordination, cooperation, and stability". After the outbreak, President Xi Jinping and President Trump spoke by phone and both said they needed to work together.
3. A comprehensive assessment of China-US relations
In recent years, the comparison of economic and military strength between China and the United States has continued to move in China's favor, and the political ecology in each country has also changed significantly. The polarization of American politics, that is, the debate between Democrats and Republicans is very fierce, and identity politics is prominent. China has stressed on the unified leadership of the Communist Party of China (CPC), stepped up efforts to strengthen party building and fight corruption, and tightened more ideological and online controls than in the past. Therefore, the contradictions between China and the United States in social system, values, and national interests are becoming more and more prominent.
The trade war is a symptom, not a cause, of deteriorating relations between China and the United States. Trade wars temporarily mask conflicts in other areas.
China's response to the trade war was relatively passive at the beginning. Since the autumn of 2019, China has put more emphasis on the initiative in the trade war and established a concept of fighting back. Since the coronavirus outbreak, the high-level exchanges between the two countries have been further reduced; instead, there is some shouting of propaganda across the ocean. The required rhetoric of the epidemic control and prevention is also making it difficult for the two sides to communicate privately, which is not conducive to easing the conflict.
Tourism, people-to-people cultural exchanges, and scientific and technological cooperation between the two sides are also at a standstill. The "two-track dialogue" between China and the United States, in which government officials and government representatives privately talk to each other's government officials or representatives, has been suspended. Think tank visits are also rare. There is little prospect of such talks resuming, at least in the short term, because of both the political concerns and traffic barriers.
Compared with the previous crises since the establishment of diplomatic ties between China and the United States, the decline in China-US relations to this stage has been a long time, covered a wide range of areas, had a strong emotional impact, and had a deep foundation of public opinion. This round of crisis in China-US relations is not sudden, but the acceleration of a long-term slippery slope down. The conflict covers military, trade, human rights, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Tibet, Xinjiang, and this outbreak. Public opinion on both sides is turning negative.
In the future, as China and the United States move toward increasingly conflicted and tense relations, there will be less and less room for compromise and maneuver. The possibility of China and the United States moving from all-out competition to all-out confrontation and falling into the so-called "Thucydides trap" cannot be ruled out.
If this trend continues, the primary strategic consideration is not the "new Cold War". Compared with the US-Soviet relations in those days, an all-out confrontation between China and the US will be more expensive than the US-Soviet confrontation. In those days, the United States and the Soviet Union were isolated from each other. There were no economic relations, no cultural exchanges, and no scientific and technological cooperation. Once China and the United States move towards full-scale confrontation, their deeply integrated economic, cultural, and social exchanges will have to be broken up by force, which is called "decoupling" or "divorce".
It used to be that the United States expected China to become more and more open and liberal, and China always felt that the relationship between China and the United States could not go too wrong. A large number of Chinese students and visiting scholars go to the United States. The two sides have conducted extensive technical exchanges and economic and trade cooperation. But now that expectation has largely disappeared, the oscillating effects and psychological "internal injuries" are starting to show up.
By contrast, the US-Soviet relationship was never intended or planned. China and the United States have high expectations for each other and are now disappointed. The pain is more severe, more prolonged and more painful than that of the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union.
Now in the United States, racism and populism are becoming apparent, such as discrimination and fear against Asians. In addition to political factors, the separation and discrimination against Chinese Americans and overseas Chinese, as well as Chinese students have become a reality. The growing sense of cultural superiority and national pride among the Chinese public also displeased Americans.
In this epidemic situation, Chinese people wear masks; westerners do not, due to the cultural and living tradition differences. It is not a political issue, but also played into the ethnic factors.
In the near term, China-US relations are unlikely to turn over suddenly. First, the phase one of the economic and trade agreement temporarily eased the economic and trade conflicts. Second, the domestic ecology of each country demands that both sides will try to avoid a serious incident in this bilateral relation. China is making every effort to fight the epidemic and achieve this year's goal of building a moderately prosperous society in all respects. As well as dealing with the outbreak, America's politicians are busy with this year’s election and partisan attacks. Third, COVID-19 is continuously spreading to the whole world, including the United States. It is difficult to predict the development of the pandemic, and it is also difficult for those who want to break up the relation to succeed. Therefore, although the China-US relationship is getting worse, it is not conducive to the abrupt change of the diplomatic ties or an overall deterioration. Of course, such a sudden change cannot be ruled out in the future.
4.  International situation and other countries' attitudes towards China-US relations
The relationship between China and the United States is also an important part of the relationship between major powers and the overall international relations. The political and economic dynamics in the rest of the world suggest a new dynamic in Russia, with President Vladimir Putin likely to remain in power until 2036. European countries are now (seeing) the rise of the nationalist right wing and populism. The Middle East is in turmoil. South Korea and Japan are busy with their own domestic affairs. Asean countries are also concentrated on their internal matters, such as Malaysia's new prime minister. Chile and other Latin American countries have also seen unrest.
In the already fragmented and diversified world pattern, and with the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, problems began to emerge in all parts of the world, and the global economy was in general decline and now even threatened to enter a recession.
In the face of China-US relations, most other countries are unwilling to join either side to fight against the other. So I don't think the world is a bipolar setup. The US pole has been weakened and the cohesion between the US and Europe has been significantly reduced under the Trump administration. China has contributed a lot to the world through its high GDP growth and export-oriented economy, especially through One Belt and One Road. But it will be hard for China to pull any country firmly to be against the US. China's rising international status is a reality, but there is no prospect of an international front against the United States.
The new outbreak has caused a considerable impact on China-US relations. Bilateral relations are declining at a faster pace; official relations are almost frozen. The lack of strategic mutual trust is increasingly serious, and the sentiment of mutual antipathy among the people is unprecedented. In the future, the implementation of phase one of the China-US trade agreement will be more difficult. The gradual decoupling of economy and technology has become an irreversible trend, and exchanges between various sectors will be further compressed. This is the most difficult period since the establishment of diplomatic ties between China and the United States in the early 1970s. How long this phase will last and where the bottom line is is hard to predict.
