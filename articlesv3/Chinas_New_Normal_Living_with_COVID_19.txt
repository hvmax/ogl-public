### China's New Normal: Living with COVID-19

14 December 2020|China, Coronavirus, Public Health
AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy and, in particular, life in China. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. We are also building a database of cities in China, and we are engaged in a major project on China’s Belt and Road Initiative. Our in-depth research focuses on places that are crucial to Chinese economic development but are far from where most foreign investors congregate. We have written several essays analyzingChina’s progress in dealing with the COVID-19 pandemicover the last year (see alsohereandhere). This post continues that work. – The Editorial Team.

Since the beginning of the COVID-19 crisis, more than 60 million people worldwide have been infected, with an average of more than 500,000 newly diagnosed daily cases in the past 30 days. However, how countries have handled the crisis has been radically different.
The United States, with a population of 330 million and 16,000,000 cases, has performed worse than any other country in the world. By comparison, China, with a population of 1.43 billion people, has had 86,701 cases – a country with a population 4 times the that of the U.S., has had about 1/200th the number of cases. Some in the United States have argued that the difference here is that China is an authoritarian country and the United States is a democracy. Of course China is going to do better in dealing with this crisis, because authoritarian governments can control their populations more directly than democratic societies can. But then, how do we explain the successes of Taiwan, South Korea, and New Zealand? These are places that value democracy and individual civil liberties just as much as the United States does, but they made their way through this crisis with a fraction of the deaths (in Taiwan’s case, the morbidity rate was 1/3000th that of the U.S.).
Because our emphasis here is the political economy and society in China, we focus our discussion here on China’s path to success. But we should note here that simple answers like weak leadership (as is the case in the U.S.) or authoritarian control are simply not enough for this discussion. Here we aspire to go deeper into the details of how China has achieved what it has in this crisis.
How Has China Achieved This?
In mainland China, at the beginning of November, there were a total of 98 newly confirmed local cases, 7.5 times the number of the previous 30 days. Many local experts warned that it was difficult to tell when the pandemic would end. Even in the most optimistic of scenarios, sporadic cases in China will last for another one to two years. After maintaining zero local cases for about eight months, Shanghai reported a new local COVID‐19 case on November 9, 2020, followed by another six cases in the next two weeks. In total there are eight local cases (Seven cases in Shanghai, one case in Anhui) related to Shanghai Pudong International Airport (PVG) throughout November. We will introduce how Shanghai dealt with the recurrence of COVID‐19 and its impact on the lives of people.
The Key to Beating the Virus: Robust Contact Tracing
As one of the largest cities in China, Shanghai is the most important node of China's domestic and international circulation. From March 27 to November 30, Shanghai Pudong International Airport
(PVG) has handled about half of the country's total inbound international flights and passengers, which is more than three times that of Guangzhou Baiyun Airport, and another top three airports in China. There is no doubt that PVG has been facing huge pressure dealing with the flow of inbound passengers and logistics. In fact, all of the cases identified in Shanghai in November were connected to PVG. Reviewing these cases, we find:
Four patients worked in the cargo area of PVG. They or their colleagues have direct contact with import airfreight containers and inbound aircraft cabin or crew members. Other patients were the spouses of above‐mentioned      patients.The patients went to hospital after showing symptoms. They were identified as suspected cases at the fever clinic, quarantined, and later diagnosed with COVID‐19.As an important part of epidemiological investigation, most of the contact tracing and nucleic acid tests were completed within 48 hours after a patient’s first visit to the clinic, which includes identifying close contacts (CC), close contacts of close contacts (CCOCC) and general contacts (GC).

COVID‐19 is highly contagious. The effective strategy to contain COVID‐19 is 4E principle: early detection, early report, early isolation, and early treatment. Shanghai and other cities in China with sporadic cases have all followed this pandemic prevention principle. How many resources are needed to achieve 4E? Here we use what happened on November 22 at PVG to explain. After the confirmation of another two cases related to PVG, the authority made the decision to conduct COVID‐19 tests for all airport cargo-related personnel. In two hours, a 240‐person medical team was assembled, sent to the airport, and started testing. When the medical team was on the way to PVG, a temporary testing area was set up and all related companies were asked to have their people wait for the test. The medical team and 300 supporting personnel worked continuously for 10 hours until 5 am the following day, and took samples for 17,719 people. Because it all happened unexpectedly, there was some chaos and serious traffic jams at PVG. When tests began, the crowd started to flow, people gradually calmed down. One out of 17,719 results turned out to be positive and later was diagnosed with COVID‐19. The person (P7) works for FedEx Shanghai.
Pronounced “R‐naught,” R0 is an indicator of how contagious an infectious disease is. Scientists have calculated the R0 of COVID‐19 to be between 2 and 3, meaning each infected individual will infect to two to three additional people, on average. In Shanghai, the speed of contact tracing turns out to be several steps ahead of the virus. Confident in its own prevention and control system, Shanghai didn’t conduct large‐scale nucleic acid test for all residents, which was done in Dalian and Qingdao. The Shanghai way is called precise prevention and control.
People Under Lockdown
In November 2020, five communities in Shanghai were identified as medium‐risk areas and were under lockdown for 14 days. In addition, the nearby Shanghai Pudong Hospital was blockaded for 14 days after a nurse (P5) was diagnosed. It is estimated that about 20,000 people have been quarantined. Upon receiving the lockdown order, the people living in the blockaded community were only allowed to enter and not to leave. Residents inside the building where the patient lives were not allowed to leave the building, with cameras and staff on duty at the building entrance around the clock Most people spent their time at home and complied with the request not to gather with neighbors.
Many lives and work schedules were disrupted. On the evening of November 20, Peng Hui, a ride‐hailing driver, took passengers into a community named “TOMORROW”. He was at TOMORROW for less than 5 minutes, but it was required that he remain there for two weeks. Many people who visited their relatives and friends the weekend before the lockdown also had to remain. In another community, four sisters visited their mother on Sunday and ended up staying together for two weeks. Some young people couldn’t take scheduled examinations. When Pudong Hospital was suddenly blockaded on November 20, 4,015 people were in the hospital. There were patients, visiting family members, doctors and nurses, and social workers. Some patients were discharged from the hospital and were ready to leave, but they couldn't. Over 1,000 doctors and nurses were sent to designated hotels because there were not enough beds inside hospital.
After the community was closed, the epidemiological investigation started immediately. Anti‐epidemic personnel knocked at every door to make inquires and to notify residents to take the test, and some of those knocks came as late as midnight. Community residents underwent three nucleic acid tests on the 1st, 5th, and 12th day of the lockdown period. The Pudong Hospital has even conducted five rounds of nucleic tests for all people. A lockdown can only be lifted if all test results are negative.
These communities are blockaded, but they are not isolated. Issues that occurred in the first few days were resolved one by one, and the order in each community was gradually restored. While pulling up the cordon along the gate, sunshades and courier racks were installed to facilitate the receipt of express packages, which are a lifeline to busy urban Shanghai. Working in home offices, many white‐collar workers asked their colleagues to send their laptops or desktops. Four tons of potatoes were sold out in 10 days to residents. TOMORROW is the largest of the five residential areas under lockdown, with some 2,000 households and a population of more than 6,000. In addition to six resident committee staff, the community also had more than 80 volunteers, including Peng, the taxi driver who was accidentally stranded. Peng started by helping neighbors complete the investigative paperwork, then he took care of a child who was living alone. There were doctors based in the communities during the lockdown to treat minor diseases. For serious illnesses, a designated ambulance was called in. At the entrance of each community, the busiest people were the couriers. Every day, TOMORROW received, on average, 1,500 online fresh food orders. Life continued inside and outside these communities.
Will My Itinerary Code Change Color after Going to Shanghai Disneyland?
Residents in other parts of Shanghai felt that the pandemic was coming back by seeing pictures or news of anti‐epidemic personnel on social media. The photo below went viral on WeChat Moments on November 11, 2020, when anti‐epidemic personnel showed up in a beef noodle restaurant. The tension was comforted by the quick and thorough response. The public is very concerned if it hears the coronavirus is back and getting closer and closer. Everybody knows the consequences if the pandemic can’t be contained.
Once a COVID-19 case is diagnosed in a residential community, its risk level will increases, and the local health codes (健康码) and national itinerary codes (通行码) of the people inside the community turn from green to orange. As long as one code is not green, movement will be affected and even legal liability may be assumed. But this does not make too much sense to people under lockdown because they are allowed to leave anyway. The main data source of the local health code and the national itinerary code is the position information of mobile devices, which is provided by communication companies. The good news is both codes of residents who live across the street from the blockaded community remain green.
Technology and the mobile tracking is speeding the process. For example, Shanghai Disneyland is surrounded by five blockaded communities. According to the feedback from Disney visitors, after returning to their city of residence, their national itinerary code did not change color, but the color of their local health code had changed for some cities, e.g. Wenzhou. Other tourists returning to Hangzhou reported that although their Hangzhou health codes were green, they received phone calls from anti‐epidemic staff on the night of their return. They were asked if they had stayed in high-risk areas in Shanghai.
In the table below, we have summarized the impact on different groups of people in Shanghai. While the community where COVID‐19 patients were living will be blockaded, other Shanghai residents can move freely within the city. However, if Shanghai residents want to travel to other provinces, especially if they need to stay in a hotel, they must check whether the hotel requires a negative nucleic acid test report or not.
Freedom and Self‐Discipline
Looking back on China’s anti‐epidemic measures, it's clear that its success comes from the top and from the spirit of support and cooperation from communities and individuals. If a policy involving millions of households is not accepted by the public, its effectiveness will be significantly reduced, and very likely the authority or officials in charge will be overwhelmed by criticism on social media. This allowed for the people and the government to act in concert when fighting against the pandemic. Many believe the key to China's success comes from its value of life consciousness, collective consciousness, and authority recognition.
There is a cultural link behind the Chinese government and ordinary people in that they both take COVID‐19 seriously. Confucius’ words “while you do not know life, how can you know about death (未知生 焉知死)” highlight the life consciousness in the Chinese tradition. The vast majority of Chinese people view strict anti‐epidemic measures a guarantee of a healthy life, their biggest freedom. Early this year, when the pandemic broke out, sometimes local governments were forced to strengthen control measures. Because health is highly valued, most people have maintained self‐discipline, and followed the three personal epidemic prevention principles by wearing masks, washing hands frequently, and maintaining social distance.
In China, collective consciousness is ubiquitous, even in Shanghai, the most western‐influenced city in mainland China. It is widely believed that the interests of individuals should fall in line with the interests of the majority. If an individual or a small group only emphasizes their own rights and interests, those harsh control measures are impossible to implement. In addition, the Chinese people are deeply influenced by Buddhism, which educates people to accept what has happened. That was obvious as people calmly accepted the unchangeable fact of the lockdown. Of course, the prerequisite for such cooperation is that the lives inside the cordon are cared for.
Confucius has also said that a superior man: “He stands in awe of the ordinances of Heaven. He stands in awe of great men. He stands in awe of the words of sages.” (畏天命,畏大人,畏圣人之言) The Chinese follow authority. Many people took the situation seriously after the lockdown of Wuhan, which occurred right before Spring Festival, because such a decision can only come from the highest level. The opinions of medical experts are the basis of government decision‐making and the guidance of ordinary people's behavior. Dr. Zhang Wenhong, who is the Chief Consultant on Infectious Diseases of the Shanghai Municipal Government and Director of Infectious Diseases Department of Shanghai Huashan Hospital, is the most trusted expert on the COVID‐19 pandemic in China. Dr. Zhang opened a Weibo account on May 11, 2020, to promote anti‐epidemic knowledge, his followers increased to 3.4 million within seven months. Now, Dr. Zhang's advice to ordinary citizens remains unchanged: wear a mask, wash hands frequently, and maintain social distance.
The COVID‐19 has been around for almost a year now. The virus is as cunning as it was when it first appeared. Living with COVID‐19 has become a new normal in China and throughout the world. Despite all this, there is a light at the end of the tunnel. With deeper understanding of this infectious disease, the people have more experience with prevention and control, so they can go about their daily lives with some confidence. And even more so, now that the vaccines are rolling out. If we respect science and remain self‐disciplined, the virus will be defeated and life will return to normal.
