### China’s CIIE 3.0: A Remarkably Safe Spot on the Planet

By The On Global Leadership Team
A year ago, the On Global Leadership (OGL) team attended the 2nd China International Import Expo (CIIE), and the experience generated one of our first OGL Insight columns. It was an incredibly successful global trade fair, with representatives from 181 countries, regions, and international organizations—some 3,800 enterprises—participating in the exhibition showcasing trade with China.
A short year later, the exhibition halls were emptier and entrance to the grounds was more complicated thanks to the COVID-19 pandemic. Gaining approval and receiving a pass to the CIIE was a bit more tiresome than the first two years. Applications were made and approvals received approximately one month before the opening day along with a notice that every approved attendee must present a negative COVID-19 test in order to enter the premises. Yet, despite the shadow of COVID-19, China signaled that it was a "new era" with a "shared future" for those participating.
The surreal moment at the Expo, which opened November 5, came as attendees filed through a tented tunnel in which their temperatures were taken by laser cameras as they queued for the facial-scanning machine at the entrance. The major outward signs acknowledging the pandemic at the entrance to the exhibition grounds was the requirement that all who entered must wear face masks.
The CIIE is the brainchild of the Xi Jinping administration. Hatched in the midst of the trade tensions between the U.S. and China, the idea was to signal the world that economic development and reforms were here to stay, and that international products and technologies were welcomed in China to counter the U.S. and other G7 nations’ accusations that China was rejecting plans for reform and interaction with the West.

The stage for this extravaganza is the largest convention center in the world, located just west of the Hong Qiao International Airport. The place is cavernous, overwhelming in scale and size. Back in January when COVID-19 was just starting its roll through China, it would have been unthinkable to consider having any exhibitions of any size in 2020. All other exhibitions were closed down for the year, making 2020 the year that wasn’t. But in May, the Chinese leadership made the audacious decision to announce that the CIIE would go on. While January and February were treacherous months for the Chinese, it was apparent by May that there was a cautious claim to having successfully controlled the spread of the virus.
Here we were six months later, that success has been replicated over and over again, each time COVID-19 would raise its head, China would smack it down, even as the pandemic reignited throughout the rest of the world. China had so succeeded in controlling the pandemic that it, above any other nation, could afford to host a massive conference that had the potential to turn into a super-spreader event.

In 2019, attendees were cheek to jowl, especially in the Consumer Products Hall and the Medical Device Hall. Somehow, fewer people extenuated the size of the place. The pavilions of many Fortune 500 companies had especially large formats. This was most obvious in the Healthcare Hall. These exceptionally large pavilions were strategically designed and positioned to fill up the space. But one only had to walk down the secondary pathways behind those behemoths to find areas filled with chairs and tables. perfect for taking a rest while checking one’s social media account. There was no room for “rest areas” at last year’s event when every space was filled with booths of small- and medium-sized enterprises.

A major attraction in the previous two Expos was the Country Hall, which was filled with pavilions showcasing a combination of travel and culture to encourage tourism as well as cultural exchange efforts with singers, dancers, and place-based products to give away. The hall was so popular that quite often senior government officials were in town to support their countries’ booths thus security was tighter so that it was difficult to gain entrance into the hall. This year that hall did not exist.
China, in its ever-creative response to the challenges of managing what must be the biggest event on the planet in 2020, put a different spin on travel and culture by showcasing domestic travel through the Chinese provincial pavilions. Xinjiang, home to the Uighur reeducation camps, had a major central position right next to the entrance to the central area. Let’s go Xinjiang! Never acknowledge defeat in the face of the COVID-19.
While the point of this Expo is to provide a platform for foreign companies to showcase their technology and solutions in the Chinese market, there are also geopolitical insights to be had. For the past four years, the Trump Administration has modeled an aggressive and contentious attitude towards China. Some leaders of other countries in an effort to show solidarity with the U.S. have followed suit in the media and from stages.

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is one example. While Johnson postured publicly, Britain launched a big public relations push on WeChat in Shanghai. The newly appointed British Ambassador, Caroline Wilson, who was fresh out of quarantine, was filmed arriving in Shanghai via high speed rail at the Hong Qiao Train station. Speaking excellent Chinese, the video essentially took the viewer through a day-in-the-life experience of a fashionably dressed ambassador who maneuvered herself through Shanghai while commenting on Chinese culture and stressing the long and close relationship between China and Britain. Despite the many bumps in the road, Wilson sent the message that Britain is open for business.
The U.S. has not supported the CIIE since its conception. This third iteration was no different. The U.S. government left it to U.S. corporations to fly the flag. The companies took the most space in this third year of the CIIE. The vast majority of them already have sizable presences in China. The Big Pharma companies, as well as engineering and technology firms, took large, can’t-be-missed presences.

The Bay Area Council of San Francisco should be congratulated for continuing to present a U.S. image. Coordinating a multi-branded, medium-sized pavilion representing companies from the Bay Area in biotech and education, it provided a pseudo-government presence under the flag of California. (The Council showcased its presence in avideo.)
With few pedestrians walking the pavilions, it was hard to find and probably not really noticed. Unlike last year where there was a big marketing and PR push, which drew crowds every day, this year was quiet. However, the fact the Council took the lead in maintaining a U.S. presence will be noticed by those who matter, mainly the Chinese government and local partners.

Japan was another country that has had a lot of international coverage about its concerns over Chinas aggressive tactics in Asia.  With that said, Japan took the most number of pavilions this year. JETRO (Japan External Trade Organization) was flying the national flag in several of the halls including Food and Agriculture and Consumer Products. Major Japanese corporations were also featured in the Medical Equipment, Intelligent Industry, and Information Technology pavilions. A close neighbor to China that depends on the Chinese market for economic stability and growth, the multi-pronged presence is expected.
New Zealand was also present in Food as well as Consumer Goods. Australian wool and milk products along with South Korean cosmetics and electronics are featured in their government pavilions, providing opportunities for small companies to participate at a subsidized rate. From a small space within a government booth, it’s an easy step to expand to an individual booth the next year.
In Asia, the reality is no matter what the pundits and activists may want the message to be, decoupling is not an option for China’s neighbors. The geopolitical messages are rather clear on the ground, and the CIIE is also a good place for foreign companies and organizations to make amends by taking this opportunity  to speak directly to Chinese consumers.
The National Basketball Association was a notable new participant this year. The NBA pavilion was front and center of the new Sports and Outdoor section of the show. Was it really only one year ago that the general manager of the Houston Rockets, Daryl Morey, tweeted support for the Hong Kong demonstrators? The response was swift and sharp, with the NBA’s business ties and televised games suspended. A year later, the NBA was an Expo star, its apparel is worn all over China as streetwear, and its major projects such as a basketball school on Hainan Island, basketball academies, and events with famous NBA stars. After 10 years building its brand, taking a year hiatus, patiently, patiently one proves one’s commitment. And, more importantly, it signaled to Chinese leaders that it had learned its lesson.
CIIE is without a doubt the biggest event on the planet this year. If the CIIE is any proof, China is taking its responsibilities as a global economic leader seriously. It went ahead, even though all signs pointed to less than positive results, and hosted the CIIE. Being the only national exhibition to promote imports, the world needs to be at peace to take full use of this opportunity. And as timeworn as it sounds, China is demonstrating to the world that it is prepared for mutual growth, interdependency, and offering infinite opportunities to participate in the second largest market in the world.
