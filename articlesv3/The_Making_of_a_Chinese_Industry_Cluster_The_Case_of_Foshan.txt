### The Making of a Chinese Industry Cluster: The Case of Foshan

10 August 2020|China, China politics, Supply Chain
AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy and, in particular, life in China. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. We have sought to advance a conversation about what the U.S.-China relationship, and a deep understanding of local economic development in China. We have written a series about the strategic strength oflocal economic development in Chinese 2nd and 3rd tier citiesandentrepreneurship in China today. This post adds to that conversation. – The Editorial Team

Economic development in China is fundamentally shaped by government guidance and centralized control. There is a lot of strategic planning going on in five-year plans, 10-year plans, and 20-year plans. This has been true since the start of economic reforms, and during the Mao Era as well.
While we often think of the Chinese government as an authoritarian, protectionist, and centralized party in Beijing, that is only one side of the government. In reality, local governments are the engines driving China’s growth. Indeed, the Chinese government is an extremely decentralized and entrepreneurial system of district and township governments. The mayors of China’s districts, townships, and villages behave like corporate CEOs, focusing on Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), pursuing foreign investment, and advancing their own careers through the financial and economic achievements in their districts and townships.
Indeed, one of our favorite path-breaking articles on China’s economic reforms, published in 1994, was Professor Andrew Walder’s insightful account of “Local Governments as Industrial Firms,” published in theAmerican Journal of Sociology.
But local governments don’t do it alone. They do it through close coordination with China’s private sector and with foreign investors from abroad. Companies like Tencent, Alibaba, and Huawei are partners, of course, but also Apple, GM, Boeing, and Microsoft have worked closely with these local governments to drive local state competition. And they work to choose areas to build industrial clusters.
What the Chinese have discovered is that private property is not the cornerstone of capitalism, as economists have long thought – local competition is. Thus, while rapid privatization programs were unleashed on the former Soviet Bloc, China carefully set in place a balance between state control and local state and incentives. It then mixed this balance with enough autonomy for local governments to go out and recruit partners from the private sector and abroad to build industrial clusters that build their local economies. One telling example of this process is a fuel cell cluster set in the small (relatively poor) city of Foshan in Guangdong Province.
A fuel cell electric vehicle (FCEV) is an electric vehicle that uses a fuel cell to power its electric motor. Compressed hydrogen gas is stored in a tank inside the vehicle and is converted by a fuel cell into electricity that generates power. An FCEV emits nothing but water and heat.
Foshan City is located in the center of the Pearl River Delta in China. In geographic location or other aspects, the relationship between Foshan and Guangzhou is similar to that of Yokohama and Tokyo. By the end of 2019, the city covered 3,798 km2 and had a population of 8.16 million. Foshan had a $1.55 trillion gross domestic product (GDP) in 2019, raising its per capita GDP to $19,000. Culturally, Foshan is known as the city of Kung Fu, cultural icon Bruce Lee lived in Foshan for a short time when he was young.
Foshan's industrial added value ranks No. 6 in China, exceeding its big brother Guangzhou. Foshan has China’s strongest white appliance industry, household ceramic industry, and lighting industry. Beginning in 2018, Foshan also has a new title, "The Hydrogen City of China.” With more than 1,500 commercial vehicles in operation, Foshan’s FCEVs outnumber other Chinese cities. Foshan has China's first FCEV bus line and the world's first commercial FCEV tram line. After 10 years, Foshan has established an industry cluster that includes hydrogen energy fuel cells and vehicles, hydrogen production, hydrogen transportation and storage, hydrogen refueling stations, and hydrogen public transportation system.
The Development Path
In 2009, Guangshun Electric (GSE), a local private company in Foshan that produced oil-free compressors and vacuum pumps, set its course for transformation. GSE entered the field of fuel cell compressor through a university engaged in hydrogen energy research. In 2010, GSE registered a new company called Guangshun New Energy (GSNE) in the Nanhai District of Foshan, the first company in the FCEV industry in Foshan. In 2015, after a research trip to North America on the latest developments of FCEV industry, officials of Foshan developed an industrial policy on FCEV and actively introduced enterprises in associated industries. By 2016, Foshan began to deploying commercial operation of FCEV in the city. As of February 2020, China has some 1,200 FCEV buses in operation, and nearly half of them are in Foshan. Sixteen of 61 hydrogen refueling stations in China are located in Foshan, the highest among all Chinese cities.
Change Lanes and Overtake (the Competition) 换道超车
“Change lanes and overtake” is a concept often mentioned by government officials in China. If a region wants to join the competition in an industry, the best way is to choose a new direction. Without a doubt, the city and district governments of Foshan are the real incubators behind Foshan's FCEV industry. Their choice is also based on this concept.
A first step forward.Economic development is the most important KPI for local officials in China. The automobile industry, because of its high contribution to GDP, is a key industry for all local governments to attract investments. The 2008 financial crisis has greatly impacted Foshan's traditional foreign trade industries, and many companies moved out or closed down. With the growth in the number of Japanese automobile manufacturers in its neighbor Guangzhou, as well as industry giants like FAW-Volkswagen, Foshan has brought in a number of auto parts companies to fill the gap.
The auto industry has become Foshan's new economic growth engine. However, the automobile industry is also in the process of transition from gasoline vehicles to New Energy Vehicles (NEV). Represented by Tesla, Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) are a more promising direction among NEVs. Guangzhou’s Toyota, Honda, and Nissan, as well as Shenzhen’s BYD have all focused on BEVs. Sales data has also proved that BEV grows faster. In 2019, annual sales of BEVs in China were 972,000 units, and the sales of FCEVs was merely 2,737 units. Not able to compete with Guangzhou and Shenzhen in BEV, Foshan government had no choice but to pick FCEV if it wanted to stay in the game. This decision was not made in a vacuum: Foshan had set up the industry foundation for the FCEV; and the city also had companies that had successfully invested in critical parts of fuel cell development.
Step by step. From 2009 to 2014, apart from holding several hydrogen energy forums, the Foshan government did not make any other major moves in FCEVs, then came the tipping point. In 2014, the general trend that NEV would replace gasoline vehicles was clear. In Foshan, though companies like GSNE were still struggling, their products and capabilities were recognized by industry peers. In April 2015, Nanhai District issued, "Development Plan for the New Energy Vehicle Industry in Nanhai District, Foshan City (2015-2025)". It also formally launched policies to accelerate the development of FCEVs.

During investment promotions, the government paid attention to companies with technology that would form a complete industry cluster. In 2016, after initial investment promotion, the FCEV industry chain was completed, and the government began to plan the application ecology, focusing on the construction of hydrogen refueling stations and using FCEV buses to replace gasoline buses. In the same year, the FCEV tram project started in Gaoming District. In 2018, Nanhai District and Foshan City successively published subsidy policy for hydrogen refueling station and the operation of FCEV buses. With the support and guidance of the government, Foshan has attracted quite a lot of hydrogen energy related companies. In Nanhai district alone, there are more than 30 companies related to FCEV. Up to this point, the Nanhai District has invested a total of $2.9 billion in cultivating the hydrogen energy industry. At the same time, technology development centers, laboratories, and testing institutions are also being developed in Foshan. As a result, the accumulation of the industry cluster has attracted capital, and a few early investments are able to exist.

Money makes the difference. More than a dozen Chinese cities including Foshan, Beijing, Shanghai, Chengdu, and Suzhou have issued FCEV industry plans. Among these cities, Foshan has the biggest subsidy for application ecology. The construction of a hydrogen refueling station can receive a subsidy of up to 5 million yuan. For the purchase of FCEV buses, Foshan provides the same subsidy amount as the subsidy from central government. The ratio of most other cities is 50 percent. During the bidding process in Foshan, companies that produce vehicles or key components in Foshan will have more advantage. Foshan has the best FCEV application ecology and the largest government procurement quantity of FCEV buses. All these measures have helped Foshan to maintain its attractiveness to the FCEV industry. It is Foshan’s wealth and commitment that makes all these possible.
Like other emerging industries, the development of Foshan's FCEV cluster has not been smooth. In 2014, if it were not for the insistence of the owner, GSNE would likely have been abandoned. The Yangtze River Automobile project, which started in 2018 and claimed to have a total investment up to $1.8 billion, was suspended. Despite all its bright prospects, the grim reality was that neither government nor enterprises knew how much they would continue to invest, for how long, and whether these investments would pay off. Foshan still had a long way to go.
The foresight of the Foshan government and the perseverance of FCEV enterprises contributed to the development of Foshan's FCEV industry. Unlike many other cities in China, successive governments in Foshan have not pursued quick GDP and tax benefits from its new industry. Of course, no one can tell what will happen when the economic situation deteriorates. The persistence of local enterprises has been critical. GSE’s willingness to invest in GSNE – some 200 million yuan or $28 million in 10 years – represents almost all the profits made by this 300-employee company. It has been an investment that continues to pay off to this day.
