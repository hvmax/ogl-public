### CHINA CONSUMPTION THEORY: THE DEEP FACTORS SHAPING CONSUMPTION

8 September 2025|China's Transforming Economy
AtOn Global Leadership, we have developed a deep analysis of the Chinese economy and the Chinese economic transformation over the last 45 years. We have written about China’s innovative approach to building the most dynamic manufacturing supply chain in the world and China’s approach to building the world’s most dynamic capitalist economy. We have advanced this through our work on China’ssecond- andthird-tier city development of innovative,entrepreneurial citiesandlocal industrial clusters. We have also used the field of NewEconomy Sociology(with leaders likeNeil Fligstein,Walter Powell, andHarrison White) and theNew Structural Economics(Justin Lin,林毅夫). In our OGL approach to research, we focus in on very specific cities, local political economies, and topics. In this series, we follow up on a meeting with one of the world’s leading economists, Professor Justin Lin. In that meeting Professor Lin, asked OGL to lay out our analysis of what was happening in China’s Consumption Economy development. This article is the fourth in a series of OGL analyses on this topic. To dive into this topic, we have looked deeply into specific issues of the consumption economy, including the use of air conditioning (hereandhere), investment in real estate (here) and other areas. In this post, we lay out the OGL theoretical framework for our analysis of China’s consumption economy.

For more than two centuries, economists have analyzed the issues of economic development and growth and the ways in which investment, strategic planning, and consumption are intimately tied together in the processes of building a strong, stable, powerful economy. Indeed, we can go back as far as Adam Smith’s brilliant work inThe Wealth of Nations(1776) in linking the issues of mercantilism, building a strong production economy (division of labor), and ultimately building a strong consumption economy that fits together with the production economy (the virtuous cycle). China is a fascinating case in this process, as China has become the most powerful manufacturing economy in the world over the last four decades. At OGL, we have written about this issue extensively, see, e.g.,here,here,here,here,here,here(and many more atOn Global Leadership: Economic Development).
Consumption has increasingly moved to the center of economic discourse in China, reflecting a growing focus on the drivers of growth and structural transformation. Long regarded as one of the three key pillars of economic growth – alongside investment and exports – consumption is now assuming a more central role as the contributions of the other two factors diminish. Its performance not only influences short-term economic dynamics but also determines the quality and sustainability of China’s medium- to long-term development trajectory. It has also become a point of focus among global economists, who are more critical of China’s economic development prospects, as some believe that the weaknesses in the consumption economy may be an Achilles Heel of China’s powerful economy. (Note: At OGL, we believe that the “Dark-Cloud” economists have simplified the issue and dramatically overstated their case about the weakness of the consumption economy.)
The first three articles in the OGL China Consumption Series examined the multifaceted nature of the country’s consumption landscape. On one hand, China’s actual consumption level appears significantly higher than its global ranking in per capita GDP would suggest; on the other hand, China’s economy continues to face a structural imbalance: strong supply capacity versus weak domestic demand. In basic terms, production and output is going well (great, even), while domestic demand remains somewhat anemic. Attributing the issue of low household consumption mainly to the influence of the real estate sector oversimplifies the problem and may obscure deeper systemic constraints. In this article, we will explain the underlying factors that constrain consumption in China, drawing insights from policy signals and official documents issued by the Central Economic Work Conferences (CEWC) between 2022 and 2024 (Note 1).
Although China’s total household consumption continues to grow, after being supplemented by public consumption through government expenditures, there remains substantial untapped potential for further consumption expansion relative to the country’s current level of industrial development and labor inputs. In Figure 1, we present the key factors that constrain the full realization of this consumption potential, along with their underlying causes, which span multiple dimensions including the macroeconomic environment, policies and institutions, income and social security, market supply and structure, and psychological and cultural influences.
As shown in the table, many of these issues have interconnected causes that cut across multiple dimensions. For example, the widely discussed phenomenon of ‘involution’ (内卷) fundamentally stems from local protectionism, which hinders the free movement of production factors and undermines fair competition (policy and institutional dimension). This distortion prevents inefficient capacity from exiting the market, thereby trapping industries in a cycle of low-quality, cutthroat competition—and ultimately reducing profit margins and suppressing wage growth (income and social security dimension). The issue is further influenced by the broader macroeconomic environment, where supply expansion consistently outpaces demand growth (macroeconomic dimension).
It is important to emphasize that while the Chinese cultural emphasis on saving and living within one’s means (psychological and cultural dimension) helps households withstand financial shocks, its interplay with an underdeveloped social security system further strengthens precautionary saving behavior. This, in turn, curtails current consumption and represents a fundamental constraint on expanding both the scale and dynamism of consumer demand.
Therefore, increasing household consumption and unlocking China’s vast consumer potential cannot be addressed by any single policy measure alone. It requires a systemic effort that involves coordinated actions among government, businesses, and households. Most critically, progress hinges on improved coordination among government agencies and deeper institutional reforms. CEWC in recent years have consistently prioritized the expansion of domestic demand and consumption stimulation, reflecting a clear shift toward a comprehensive, system-wide approach.
From 2022 to 2024, the three CEWCs maintained a consistent and stable approach to diagnosing and addressing insufficient effective demand, while continuously refining policies in response to evolving economic conditions. Specifically:
The assessment has progressively deepened over time: The central government’s understanding of economic challenges evolved from the general “three-fold pressures” framework in 2022 to identifying “insufficient domestic demand” as the core constraint in 2023–2024. This diagnosis is directly linked to real-world challenges such as difficulties in business operations and pressures on employment and income growth, highlighting that weak demand has become a key limiting factor for economic circulation and improvements in people’s livelihoods.The policy approach has undergone a progressive upgrade: Starting from the foundational 2022 call to “restore and expand consumption,” to the 2023 emphasis on a synergistic mechanism for “stimulating potential consumption” and fostering a “virtuous cycle between consumption and investment,” and further to 2024’s “expanding domestic demand in an all-around way.” This phase includes targeted campaigns to boost consumption, prioritizes income growth and burden reduction for low- and middle-income groups, enhances social security benefits, and strengthens cross-sector coordination and long-term project planning. Overall, the policy framework has become significantly more comprehensive, targeted, and systematically structured.Emphasis on Long-Term Mechanisms: While addressing short-term demand fluctuations, the CEWCs have consistently underscored the importance of building long-term institutional frameworks:

Overall, the policy framework has become significantly more comprehensive, targeted, and systematically structured.
• Emphasis on Long-Term Mechanisms: While addressing short-term demand fluctuations, the CEWCs have consistently underscored the importance of building long-term institutional frameworks:
+ In 2022, the conference called for “integrating the strategy of expanding domestic demand with deepening supply-side structural reform in a coordinated way”;
+ In 2023, it emphasized “synergizing supply-side reforms with efforts to expand effective demand” and reaffirmed the need to “rely on reform and opening up to enhance the endogenous drivers of development.”;
+ In 2024, the framework further evolved with the introduction of the “Five Coordinations,” which outline a systematic approach to balancing the relationships between an efficient market and an effective government, aggregate supply and demand, fostering new growth drivers and upgrading traditional ones, optimizing incremental resources and utilizing existing ones, and improving quality while expanding total output. The objective is to ensure smooth national economic circulation, enhance resource allocation efficiency, and promote the development of new quality productive forces in light of local conditions.
This progression illustrates that the central government’s understanding of insufficient effective demand has shifted from addressing cyclical fluctuations to tackling deep-seated structural imbalances and strengthening mechanisms of economic governance.
The series of measures adopted by CEWC to expand demand and stimulate consumption reflects the core characteristics of China’s current economic policies: a pragmatic and integrated “policy fusion” that draws on insights from multiple theoretical traditions rather than adhering rigidly to any single school of thought. These policies apply Keynesian demand management to stabilize short-term economic growth, incorporate supply-side economics and endogenous growth theory to enhance medium- to long-term supply capacity, and aim to establish long-term mechanisms through institutional reforms grounded in the principles of institutional and development economics. Across all these approaches, the guiding methodology remains the integration of an “efficient market” with an “effective government.” (Note 2)
Ultimately, expanding domestic demand is a “protracted battle” that depends on transforming mindsets and advancing deep structural reforms. There is no quick fix, and success lies in strengthening foundational elements: stabilizing employment to build public confidence, improving social security to reduce anxiety, and optimizing institutions to enhance long-term expectations. The central government’s strategy is clear: respond to short-term fluctuations with targeted support, but more importantly, pursue systemic reform to address deep-seated imbalances.
However, successful implementation ultimately hinges on human initiative. The 2024 conference emphasized this point with a clear directive: “Enable motivated and capable officials to act and deliver results,” directly addressing the widespread tendency among cadres to “play it safe and avoid mistakes.” Only by cultivating an environment that encourages proactive governance can top-down strategies be effectively translated into concrete outcomes for consumption recovery. This raises an important question: How can officials be incentivized to prioritize consumption as strongly as they do GDP? Our next article in the OGL China Consumption Series will explore this issue in greater depth.
Final Theoretical Note
As a final note, in our work at On Global Leadership, we have built a strong argument that, over the last four decades, China has built the strongest economic development economy in the world. We have strong theoretical works that inspire our research and writing on the important topic of China’s successful and dramatic rise to becoming one of the world’s largest economies (currently #2 in the world) and the home of the world’s most sophisticated, innovative, and powerful manufacturing supply chains. But this is not simply a story of a deep, cheap labor pool. Rather, this is a story of deep thinking about and experimentation and innovation around economic development at central and local government levels. And this includes innovation and experimentation around the links between economic investment, economic development,andconsumption.
Borrowing from Professor Andrew Walder’s insightful article (1995), we havepreviously writtenabout how the Chinese Government “pushes and develops rising stars in the political industrial complex… Walder, first wrote about the concept of ‘local governments as industrial firms’ in 1995, explaining how China succeeded in transforming its state-owned enterprises without following the model of rapid privatization… The Chinese Government in Beijing thinks very carefully about five-year plans but also about how to empower, encourage, and incentivize localities to develop with Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), which are typically tied to economic development, poverty alleviation, and responses to social crises. The Central Government carries out its program of leadership development not just through incentives but also throughexperimentswith moving successful leaders around to different struggling localities. We might think of this process as a sophisticated human resource (HR) plan for developing elite governmental leaders.” On a theoretical level, our team brings together:
Andrew Walder’s deep insights about “local governments as industrial firms.”Neil Fligstein’s ideas set forth in The Architecture of Markets (2001) and the New Economic Sociology, which emphasizes state-market relations in the creation of a “culture of innovation” in economic development.Justin Lin’s “New Structural Economics,” a framework for policy and economic development that he first developed during his time at the World Bank and has continued to build after his return to China and Beijing University.

In this current series of articles (The OGL China Consumption Series), we have worked to deploy these theoretical insights into how China is building a consumption economy. All countries have their own histories and cultures, and we prefer to account for and incorporate these factors into our analyses. For example, at this point in China’s history, the populace and culture have a proclivity for much higher savings than many other nations. For example, the United States, the world’s largest economy, has a household savings rate of about 4.6%; China, the world’s second largest economy, has a household savings rate of about 43.2%. There are many reasons behind these differences – both culture and recent institutional history are key – but the central issue here is that difference have important consequences for the consumption economies (i.e., if you are saving more, you are spending and consuming less). Our point here is that complex, sophisticated analyses need to talk into account, history, culture, national-local dynamics (local governments as industrial firms), building cultures of innovation, and the New Structural Economics.
We look forward to more intense and intellectually engaged dialogue over these important issues. On Global Leadership (OGL) will continue to be a venue for this discussion.
