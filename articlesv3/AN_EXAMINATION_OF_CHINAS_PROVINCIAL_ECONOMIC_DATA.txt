### AN EXAMINATION OF CHINA’S PROVINCIAL ECONOMIC DATA

21 February 2024|China, Economic Development, Local Government
AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy and, in particular, life in China. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. We have sought to advance a conversation about the U.S.-China relationship, and a deep understanding of local economic development in China. We have written a series about the strategic strength oflocal economic development in China’s 2nd and 3rd tier citiesandentrepreneurship in China today. These case studies are part of a larger project in which we report on the strength of China’s economic development model (e.g.,hereandhere). Our focus in these posts is on the Chinese theory of economic development – what Andrew Walder has called “local governments as industrial firms” – and on examples of local leaders operating in this practice of development. In many ways, these local leaders are the hidden heroes of China’s economic development success. In aggregate, our discussion of these cases and the economic theory they illuminate allow us to explain – both theoretically and empirically – why China’s capitalist economy is destined to be the most powerful economy in the world. This post adds to that conversation.
AN EXAMINATION OF CHINA’S PROVINCIAL ECONOMIC DATA: LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AS INDUSTRIAL FIRMS
On January 17, 2024, China’s National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) released a preliminary Gross Domestic Product (GDP) figure of ￥126 trillion (US$17.52 trillion) for 2023, indicating a rate of 5.2 percent year-on-year growth at constant prices. With the convening of provincial two sessions (1), 31 provinces, autonomous regions and provincial-level municipalities have all released their 2023 GDP data and the development targets for 2024.
How does the provincial economic score look? Who are the winners and losers? In this article, we will dive into some important provincial economic indicators and try to answer these questions.
But first a little theory. For many decades, two economic theories have dominated the debate of how capitalist market economies are organized. In the era of the Great Depression, John Maynard Keynes became the leading voice for thinking about how governments should engage with markets and national economic development. His revolutionary book,The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money, published in 1936, Keynes rejected the classical economic theory idea that competitive markets would naturally and efficiently reach equilibrium and should thus be left to operate free of government intervention.The Great Depression, which was well underway when Keynes’ magnum Opus was published, provided a great refutation of Classical economic thinking and an ushering in of Keynesian-style economic thinking, which underpinned the rebuilding of Western economies in the wake of the Great Depression.
Keynes’ influence began to wane in the 1970s, asThe Chicago School of Economics, led by University of Chicago Professors Milton Friedman and George Stigler, ushered in a new era of Neoclassical Economic Thought, a return to the idea that deregulated markets were the most rational, logical, and efficient way to organize local and national economies. We would note here that many readers and advocates cite Adam Smith as the founder of classical economic thought. And while Smith is famous for the notion of the invisible hand of the market, where individuals making rational economic decisions would efficiently aggregate into the most efficient outcomes. We question whether any of these advocates have actually read Smith’s classicThe Wealth of Nations, as the notion of the invisible hand of the market was but one small part of a much larger, more comprehensive political economic analysis.
Neoclassical Economics received a tremendous policy-oriented boost when Professor Friedman became Ronald Reagan’s economic advisor during his campaign in 1980 and then influentially on Reagan’s Economic Policy Advisory Board throughout his presidency. This rise of Neoclassical Economic Theory has been a disaster for the American working and middle classes. As we have writtenpreviously, “From 1970 to 2020, the middle class share of aggregate income fell from 62% to 43% while the aggregate income of upper income households grew from 29% to 48% over the same period, according to Pew. This is also the reason that the top 1% of US families control an astounding 38.5% of America’s wealth, the highest ratio of anywhere in the world.” This theory also shaped the “Shock Therapy” (inspired by what was also called the “Big Bang” approach first put forth in 1986) approach to transitions from planned to market economies, shaped by Jeffrey Sachs and Janos Kornai, among others. This approach was a disaster for the market transitions of former communist planned economies in the Soviet Bloc.
China rejected the advice of Sachs and Kornai, forging a much different path. It is our view, both theoretically and empirically that China’s gradualist and experimental approach to economic has been superior. In previous posts, we have put forward our theoretical argument about why China’s reform-era economic development has been so successful. We have laid out two core concepts. First, China’s reform-era development process has been set forth through gradualism and experimentation. In Chinese, the phrase “feeling for stones to cross the river” (摸石头过河) implies a step-by-step process in which leaders experiment with new models, gradually stepping on each new stone as they move toward opposite river bank. Second, we build on the brilliant analysis set forth in Andrew Walder’s (1995) pathbreaking article “Local Governments as Industrial Firms,” published inThe American Journal of Sociology. Following Walder, we argue that China’s economy has been built on a healthy balance between centrally-defined goals – the Five-Year Plans – and a decentralized system in which local jurisdictions are given incentives and latitude to find the path to reaching the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), which come out of those plans. As we have described in previous posts (see here):
“Economic development in China is fundamentally shaped by government guidance and centralized control. This has been true since the beginning of the economic reforms (and during the Communist Era as well). However, while we often think of the Chinese government as the authoritarian, protectionist, centralized party in Beijing, that is only one side of the government. In reality, local governments are the engines driving China’s growth. Indeed, the Chinese government is an extremely decentralized and entrepreneurial system of district and township governments. The mayors of China’s districts, townships, and villages behave like corporate CEOs, focusing on KPIs, pursuing foreign investment, and advancing their own careers through the financial and economic achievements in their districts and townships. But they don’t do it alone – they do it through close coordination with China’s private sector and with foreign investors from abroad. Companies like Tencent, Alibaba, and Huawei, but also Apple, GM, Boeing, and Microsoft have worked closely with these local governments to drive a phenomenon of local state competition. What the Chinese have discovered is that private property is not the cornerstone of capitalism, as economists have long thought – local competition is. Thus, while rapid privatization programs were unleashed on the former Soviet Bloc, China carefully set in place a balance between state control and local state incentives. It then mixed this balance with enough autonomy for local governments to go out and recruit partners from the private sector and abroad. It has allowed China to build the most dynamic manufacturing supply chain in the world. And it has allowed China to quietly become one of the most innovative economies in the world. Through our analyses of cases that range from Tier 1 cities like Shanghai, Hangzhou, and Shenzhen to Tier 2, 3, and 4 cities like Changzhou, Zhenjiang, Nantong, Guiyang, and many others, we analyze how local governments are creating the framework for a new economic landscape in China.”
So, that is the theory, and we have illuminated this theory through a variety of case studies, looking in depth at cities like Dongguan, Changzhou, Zhenjiang, Chengdu, and many others. However, these case studies also roll up into larger administrative units, the thirty-one Provincial-level units that sit one step below the national government. So, let’s dive in to the data.
Overview of GDP Performance
2023 is a year we see some changes in provincial GDP rankings. Sichuan overtook the fifth place from Henan, Shanghai replaced Anhui and re-entered the top 10 list, and Liaoning surpassed Chongqing. Although all 31 provincial-level areas have achieved positive GDP growth, digging into the provincial data presents a varied picture.
Overall, provinces in China’s eastern (Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Shanghai, Shangdong) and western (Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, Guanxi) regions performed well, while the central region (Shanxi, Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Anhui, Jiangxi) has declined in its development momentum. Guangdong, Jiangsu, Shandong, Zhejiang and other traditional economic power houses remain major contributors to the country’s economic growth and Yangtze River Delta (Shanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, part of Anhui) and Guangdong continue to gain the share of economy.
GDP growth rates at constant prices diverge significantly:
There are 13 provinces below the national average (5.2%), including developed regions like Guangdong, Fujian and Shanghai.Among the 17 provinces that exceed the national average, Jiangsu, Shandong, and Zhejiang stand out.16 provinces fail to meet growth targets set at the beginning of 2023, Heilongjiang (-3.4%), Jiangxi (-2.9%), Henan (-1.9%), Hunan (-1.9%), Yunnan (-1.6%) and Fujian (-1.5%) were the ones with the largest gaps.
• There are 13 provinces below the national average (5.2%), including developed regions like Guangdong, Fujian and Shanghai.

The national GDP growth rate of 5.2% in 2023 is calculated at constant prices (2) and is higher than the increase rate of 4.6% (current price), a sign that China’s economy is generally in a state of deflation and echoes the feelings of ordinary people and voices on social media. Twenty-two out of the 31 provinces reported a nominal GDP growth rate lower than that at constant price, the largest difference (5.0% vs 0.4%) went to Shanxi, a major coal mining province affected by the decline in resource prices.
Why does Henan Fall Behind Sichuan?
Henan and Sichuan are both populous provinces. By the end of 2022, the number of permanent residents in Henan and Sichuan was 98.72 million and 83.74 million, ranking third and fifth in the country, respectively. On GDP value, Henan has long maintained the fifth place and the leading position among central and western provinces, but no longer. Sichuan has surpassed Henan with its GDP of over ￥6 trillion. Why? Not to oversimplify, but there are two major reasons for this reversal:
First, at the end of 2023, NBS released revised 2022 national GDP after final verification – ￥120 trillion, a decrease of ￥548.3 billion from the initial release. Henan’s GDP figure was lowered by ￥312.5 billion to ￥5.82 trillion. Although it is common for there to be some difference between the final data and the preliminary predictions, the adjustment of Henan’s 2022 data was quite significant. As a result, when Sichuan’s nominal GDP growth rate came out as 6.3% higher than Henan’s in 2023, the ranking of two provinces was reversed.Second, the downward revision of the GDP data exposed a deep-seated issue in Henan’s economy – the quality of development. Henan is an industrial province, known as a leader in iPhone supply chain after Foxconn put its major manufacturing base in Zhengzhou City. Impacted by geopolitical factors and the slowdown of smart phone upgrading, although Henan is still able to maintain the output scale of its mobile phone industry, it is obvious that its growth engine has been slowing down. As presented in the table below, because the added value of Henan’s secondary industry increased only slightly after 2018, its lead over Sichuan has narrowed significantly. Henan’s consumption power also lags behind Sichuan. From 2018 to 2023, while the proportion of resident population in Sichuan to that of Henan decreased from 86.8% to 84.8%, the proportion of total retail sales of social consumer goods increased from 88.6% to 98.9%.

What Happened to Tianjin?
Tianjin, a municipality directly under the central government, still struggled to boost its economic performance in 2023. The city’s GDP growth rate once again underperformed the national average, its GDP scale ranked 24th at provincial level and 11th in the city ranking.
There was a time when talking about tier one cities of China, people would mention Beijing, Tianjin and Shanghai, a time Shenzhen was a village and Guangzhou fell way behind Tianjin. After the reform and opening up, the economy in the south has developed rapidly, while the north is relatively stagnant. Tianjin was outdistanced by southern cities like Guangzhou, Shenzhen and Suzhou.
In 2006, in order to balance regional development, the central government put forward the national strategy of building Tianjin Binhai New Area into the third pole of China’s economy, or simply speaking, to build another Shenzhen or Shanghai Pudong New Area. Because of geographical convenience, central enterprises headquartered in Beijing had invested heavily in projects in petrochemical, steel, equipment manufacturing, aerospace and so on in Tianjin. On foreign investment, Tianjin has attracted multinational companies like Airbus, Samsung, and LG etc. to set up manufacturing base. Tianjin’s industrial structure has been leaning towards heavy industry and traditional manufacturing, and its performance in new industries such as the Internet and new energy is mediocre.
So, after the central government launched supply-side reform in 2015, Tianjin’s GDP growth rate plunged from 9.1% in 2016 to 3.6% in 2018. To make things worse, NBS strengthened the verification of statistical data, removed the double entry of GDP data caused by difference in company registration locations and actual operating locations. As a result, Tianjin’s 2018 GDP was cut by 29% in early 2020.
The slowdown in the adjustment of industrial structure, especially the dependence on heavy chemical industry, is the cause of Tianjin’s dilemma. Around 2017, Tianjin began industrial transformation, shut down polluting enterprises, its steel companies took the initiative to reduce production capacity. However, compared with southern cities like Shanghai, Hefei and Dongguan, which were also under the pressure of economic transform, Tianjin has not cultivated enough new industries to replace the old ones. To restore its past glory, Tianjin will have a long way to go.
Revenue of Local Government
General Public Budget Revenue refers to tax revenue and non-tax revenue collected by local government; it is the major source of local public expenditure. Having this said, compared to GDP, this important indicator of economy receives less attention on social media.
Collating 2023 provincial general public budget revenue data, we found the following characteristics:
Total revenue –Unlike the GDP, top six fiscal cows are all in the eastern region. Once the base of heavy industry of China, three northeastern provinces (Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang) now fall behind the western provinces like Guizhou and Yunnan.General Public Budget Revenue /GDP –This ratio represents the value content of GDP. The top two regions are Shanghai and Beijing, which have developed high performing service industries; followed by Inner Mongolia and Shanxi, both are major coal-producing provinces. Henan and Jiangsu ranked 6th and 7th from the bottom respectively, objectively reflecting the fierce competition and low added value in their major industries such as the manufacturing of electronic information products and new energy products.Average growth rate 2022 to 2023 – As China implemented new VAT refund policy in 2022, in order to better understand the changes in local fiscal revenue, we would focus more on the average growth rate of 2022 and 2023：

The western provinces grew faster than the eastern provinces. The two-year average growth rate in the western region was 6.5%, followed by the central region at 4.9%, the eastern region at 0.9%, and the northeast region reported the slowest growth rate at 0.1%.8 provinces reported lower General Public Budget Revenue in 2023 than in 2021, including economic powerhouses Guangdong and Jiangsu.The impact of geopolitical conflicts varies from province to province. Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, Shaanxi and other provinces have benefited from rising resource prices; but the economy in the eastern region has been hit by unfavorable factors such as rising material and energy prices, declining export to western markets as well as real estate regulation.

2024 GDP Growth Targets
Thirty provincial-level regions in China had unveiled GDP growth targets of about or above 5% for 2024, only Tianjin at around 4.5%. The highest goal belongs to Hainan (8%), and major economic provinces such as Beijing, Shanghai, Guangdong, Jiangsu, and Shandong expect to expand their economy by 5%, the weighted average of 31 provinces is 5.4%. According to the history that national goals are generally lower than those of the provinces, people are expecting that Beijing will set around 5% GDP set in the national two sessions in March 2024.
While focusing on numbers in GDP growth targets, we also need to note the nuances at play in the words we use to describe these positions. “Above” is easy to understand, but the concept of “around” is vague that leaves room for interpretation. For example, when Hainan proposed a target of about 9.5% in 2023 and actually achieved 9.3%, no one questioned whether Hainan achieved its growth target. It is generally accepted that if the difference is not more than 0.5% and the government revenue also grows in tandem.
Thirteen provinces, including Guangdong, Henan, Fujian, and Anhui, set their 2024 target higher than their 2023 real growth rate, sending out positive signals that the effects of support policies are gradually coming into play.
It appears that most provinces now see industry the engine driving economic growth and have set the industry growth target higher than that of the GDP. However, under the weak consumption and severe foreign trade situation, how to find market for huge industrial capacity is a serious challenge.
Provincial governments emphasize the following two points in their road map to achieve 2024 economic goal: (1) High quality development - not only paying attention to the growth of economic volume, but also improving the quality of development; (2) New productive forces – leveraging innovation to speed up the development of advanced productivity through innovation, new economic growth mode that features high-tech, high efficiency and high quality. Indeed, innovation and high-quality development are key factors to determine the future of China’s economy.
For 2024, it remains to be seen what changes will take place in China’s economic map and whether China will be able to overcome the challenges and headwinds of development. Our prediction is cautiously optimistic.
1.  The term “Two Sessions” refers to the yearly plenary meetings of the National People’s Congress (NPC) and the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC).
2.  GDP at constant prices converts the value based on the current price into a value based on the price of certain base period. After price effects are removed, the values of two different periods can be compared to reflect the volume changes, i.e., the real changes of production activity results.
3.  GDP data released in the beginning of a year are subject to revision when more information from financial data and administrative records become available. Where a census has been conducted, or significant accounting methods reform implemented, historical GDP data will also be revised. 2018 is the year of the fourth national economic census, and the NBS revised the historical data of GDP since 1952 based on the data of economic census.
4.  China data in this article does not include that of Hong Kong SAR, Macau SAR and Taiwan unless otherwise stated.
