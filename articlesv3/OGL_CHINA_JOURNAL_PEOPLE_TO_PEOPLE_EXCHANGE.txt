### OGL CHINA JOURNAL, PEOPLE-TO-PEOPLE EXCHANGE

3 April 2025|China, China history, Culture, OGL
At On Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy and, in particular, life in China. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. We share our expertise about economic development in China and China’s economic reforms, U.S.-China relations, China’s changing role in the global political economy, and the history and current state of Chinese politics. We also aspire to help our Chinese audience understand broader changes in the global political economy. In this post, we discuss our most recent on-the-ground research trip, where OGL’s Guthrie joined the team in China to conduct research and give talks in Shanghai, Shenyang, and Beijing. In particular, we focus here on the People-to-People Exchange talk Guthrie delivered in Beijing at the end of his visit.
As part of our OGL mission as a research team, we attempt to share our analytical insights of what is occurring in China but also share our boots-on-the-ground observations and experiences as a research team in China (see, e.g.,here,here). We believe in deep, sophisticated economic, political, and social analysis, but we also believe in the importance of real face-to-face, on-the-ground experience. A few weeks ago, I traveled to China to work with the OGL China team, and we recounted some of the details of that trip in a previous post (here).
However, one of the key moments of this early-March trip involved giving a talk in Beijing on people-to-people exchanges and the current (deteriorating) state of U.S.-China relations. It is an important and critical moment for US-China relations, and it is critical that we think about our will and desire to have constructive, healthy, generative relations with other cultures, other people, other nations.
There are a number of milestones in U.S.-China relations right now. First, we are nearing the 80-year anniversary of the end of World War II, and this is a time that Chinese citizens remember well. It was the American Volunteer Airforce Group (AVG) – nicknamed the Flying Tigers – that is remembered for having saved China in the war against Japan.
Following WWII, Americans were then very supportive of the Chinese Nationalists (the KMT), who lost the revolution to the Communists, and sought refuge on the island of Taiwan. Things went a little dark in U.S.-China relations in the years following the Communist Revolution. The Nationalists fled to Taiwan, and China suffered the Maoist Era, which included the Great Leap Forward (1958-62), the Great Famine that followed this errant policy, and the Cultural Revolution (1966-76), which lasted until Mao’s death in 1976.
Then, in 1979, things began to open back up between our two nations. In February 1979, Deng Xiaoping flew to Washington D.C., shook hands with Jimmy Carter, normalized U.S.-China relations, went to a John Denver concert at the Kennedy Center, and quietly opened the doors for more engagement, greater people-to-people exchange between our two nations.
In the wake of that budding partnership, pioneering scholars and businesspeople like Ezra Vogel, my doctoral dissertation advisor, Thomas Gold, Julie Reinganum, and our OGL business partner, the late Diane Long, all traveled to China in the years after Deng's economic opening to build ties, build relationships, build friendships and partnerships. I followed in the footsteps of these great scholars and business leaders, attempting to build a career that would help the world better understand China.
In 1989-90, I spent my first year in Greater China, living in Taiwan, studying Chinese, teaching English, and training with the Taiwanese National Cycling Team. It was a crazy introduction to the land, people, and culture I would spend my life getting to know. In 1994-95, I spent my first year in Shanghai conducting my doctoral dissertation research, which would become the basis for my first book (here). Over the decades that followed, there were many other periods I spent time in China, including the period from 2014-19, as I worked for Tim Cook and Joel Podolny as the head of Apple University in China. It has been a true gift to grow up with China, as one small, individual member of the people-to-people-exchange team building relationships supporting US-China relations.
To be very clear and blunt: the United States and China are the world’s two largest economies, and we have a long history of working together. And we MUST continue this work and collaboration together. Abandoning our collaborative relationship and falling into an Economic Cold War (or worse) will be a disaster – it will be a disaster for both nations, and it will be a disaster for the global political economy. People-to-people exchange is the key to this continued collaboration. Friendships, partnerships, discussion, debate, learning from each other, growing together… this is what we must continue to do.
People-to-People Exchanges
During my recent trip to China, one of my collaborators, Thunderbird Alum, Ling Yun, organized a talk where I would present to an audience about people-to-people exchange. We began our event at the museum of the Chinese Overseas Student Association in Beijing (欧美同学会), where this talk was held. It was a perfect venue to think about and engage an audience about people-to-people exchanges and the fate of our two nations.
After we arrived at the venue, Ling Yun took us through a tour of the Chinese Overseas Student Association Museum, which documented the history of people-to-people exchanges between China and the world.
One fun moment: a picture of the 16-year-old Deng Xiaoping in 1920, as he readied himself to board the ship (in steerage) from China to France so he could “learn from the West and come back and save China.”
Following the Museum visit, we migrated to the speaking venue.
The organizer, Ling Yun, knew that, over the years, I had built a relationship with the eminent Chinese economist, Justin Lin (Lin Yifu, 林毅夫). In recent years, I had fallen out of touch with Professor Lin, which I regretted. When Ling Yun introduced me to my translator for the speech, she said, “Professor Guthrie, this is someone you have to meet. This is your translator. You both have something in common. You both admire someone very important.”
I had no idea what Ms. Ling was talking about, so I inquired… “Sorry, who do we know in common?” The translator replied, “Well, I think she is talking about my father-in-law. Ms. Ling told me you are friends with my father-in-law, Justin Lin.” Needless to say, I was blown away. Needless to say, after the event, I was very quickly back in touch with my old friend, Justin Lin. And I will NOT let that friendship go again. People-to-people exchange.
It was exciting to be speaking and sharing the stage with two other Chinese intellectual leaders, who listened to my presentation and followed up with comments of their own. It was exciting to recount the importance of people-to-people exchange and these ties have shaped the relations between the world’s two most powerful economies.
The end of the talk was a little bit sad for me, however. I have spent my entire adult life working toward building understanding between our two nations – helping Americans understand China and helping Chinese people understand how Americans think. To be quite honest, I don’t remember the tone being this sad in the thirty-plus years I have been traveling to China.
There were genuine questions, “Why do you Americans hate the Chinese people so much?” Of course, I answered that this was not the case: “Yes, things are a little tense right now, but many people in my country deeply value our relationship with China, its culture and its people.” Their answer (on at least one of these exchanges), “Well, Professor Guthrie, we know you are a friend of China, but it seems like many Americans don’t like Chinese people…” It was a very sad, troubling exchange.
To end on a happier note, despite these sad moments, I was very proud to be there representing the Thunderbird School of Global Management of Arizona State University. As I mentioned above, many people in China have a positive and fond historical memory for the American Volunteer Group, the Flying Tigers. Most people do not know that, while the AVG was stationed in Kunming, China, one of the Airforce training sights some eight thousand miles around the world was the Thunderbird Airfield in Glendale, Arizona.
Following World War II, this airfield would be the founding grounds of the Thunderbird School of Global Management. The argument at the time was, in the wake of WWII, we should build trade relations instead of fighting wars. As founding faculty member William Lytle Schurz famously opined, “Borders frequented by trade seldom need soldiers.” In this day and age, Thunderbird leads the world of business and management education in research and teaching on global trade. People-to-people exchange.
And, of course, we ended the way all events like this in China end, with a beautiful meal and hours of deep, passionate conversation about US-China relations, global politics, and people-to-people exchange. It was a marvelous event, and I can honestly say I am deeply proud to be a China scholar and someone who has committed his life to helping the world understand this important nation, and remain committed to people-to-people exchanges.
