### OGL IN-DEPTH: China’s Top Scientists and Research Institutes

21 March 2022|China, Economic Development
AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy and, in particular, life in China. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. We have written a series about the strategic strength oflocal economic development in China’s 2nd and 3rd tier citiesandentrepreneurship in China today. We have written aboutinnovation in the Chinese economyandeconomic developmentas it relates tosocial inequality. We have also written about thestrategy and logic of local economic development in China’s reform era. This post furthers our analysis of China’s economic development by focusing on China’s research institutes and powerful talent pool.
By The On Global Leadership Team
What drives a country’s competitiveness? One key is the ability to innovate. And innovation depends on talent. A country’s innovation capability is not only determined by the quantity of talent, but also, more importantly, the quality of the talent pool. China currently trains the largest number of engineers in the world every year, but people doubt whether China can cultivate outstanding scientists. After all, China has only one locally trained Nobel Laureate in science (1).
At On Global Leadership, we have explored a number of forces undergirding China’s economic reforms, seeking to understand the conditions and policies that have led to China’s dramatic rise from a country on the verge of collapse in 1979 to the soon-to-be largest economy in the world. Until now, we have not touched the issue of talent, but the political economy of talent and innovation are crucial parts of China’s rise.
As an aside, it is still often the case that China is seen through the lens of theshanzhaimovement (i.e., the copycat movement) – a copier and thief of Western intellectual property; a country that will not be able to truly innovate. Some prominent American academics have written about China from this point of view, and we have examined (and rejected) their arguments in otherposts. This facile view is simply not accurate today.
Can China become a stage for top scientists? In recent years – especially pre-pandemic – we have seen China relaxing the flow of human capital and Chinese authorities facilitating the exchanges and flow of talent to facilitate global scientific and business learning. So, if Washington closes the doors to America, Beijing will benefit. There is a cadre of scientists, researchers, and researchers in China's vaunted institutes and research universities who are driving innovation and remaking the face of China's talent pool Here, we call out some of their names.
Jianwei Pan – The Scientist Challenging America's Quantum Supremacy
If we were asked to nominate one scientist who can represent the height of scientific research excellence in China today, Jianwei Pan (1970 - ) would be our only pick. He is nothing short of a superstar in the scientific community, and for good reason:
1. Pan has a history of world-class achievements: the creation of Micius, the world’s first quantum communications satellite and quantum computer that beats Google'sSycamore.
2. Pan's field of research is critical: quantum information science (QIS) is one of the foundational technologies of the 21st century.
Pan, a professor at the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) in Hefei, is a world-leading researcher in QIS and is known as the man turning China into a quantum superpower. One of Pan’s most remarkable works is the distribution of entangled photons over a distance of 1,120 km, by far the longest distance ever reached.
Pan received his bachelor's and master's degrees at USTC, majoring in modern physics. He continued his study and research at the University of Vienna, Austria, where he received his PhD in 1999. He stayed as research PI (Principal Investigator) until 2001. Pan returned to USTC as a professor in Department of Modern Physics.
Pan and his team have received numerous honors, including "Features of the Year 2012" byNature, "2015 Breakthrough of the Year" byPhysics World,Nature's10 (2017),Timemagazine's100 Most Influential People of 2018, the Quantum Communications Award (2012) and the ZEISS Research Award (2020). Pan also was appointed  lead editor ofPhysical Review Researchin 2019.
Pan's success, apart from his personal talent and charisma, can be attributed to the following:
1.His academic studies started at the highest level.Pan chose quantum physics for his research at USTC after having studied under Anton Zeilinger, an Austrian quantum physicist who is called a pioneer in quantum information. Pan has also been involved in quantum physics at international level since his PhD study.
2.Full support from the state. Pan's academic achievements abroad earned him credibility in China. With the support of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) and the Ministry of Science and Technology (MST), the 31-year-old Pan established his Quantum Physics and Quantum Information Laboratory once he returned to China. That lab has now developed into a research division with 41 faculty members in Hefei and Shanghai.
3.Effective talent development.With sufficient funds, Pan sent a number of young scholars to leading QIS institutions in Europe and America for study. These scholars have all returned to China after completing their studies or work overseas. In this way, Pan has built a research team with international vision and complementary skills.
Now Pan has built a QIS research ecosystem: his core team is the division of quantum physics and quantum information of USTC, supported by other research institutes in CAS. Pan’s research areas cover:
Quantum foundation and quantum communicationQuantum computing and quantum simulationQuantum metrologyQuantum theory
• Quantum foundation and quantum communication
• Quantum computing and quantum simulation
• Quantum metrology
• Quantum theory
Pan also co-founded Quantum CTek Co., Ltd. (QCT) to industrialize his work. The technology of QCT comes from Pan's research team at USTC, and it provides QIS-enabled security products and services to customers like the Chinese government, telecommunication companies, and financial institutions. When the company went public in July 2020 (2), among China’s 7,000 kilometers of quantum-secured communication networks in use, more than 6,000 kilometers used QCT products. QCT allows Pan's research to connect with real-world applications, and meanwhile, made him one of the richest scholars in China.
Since QIS was introduced to China by USTC scholars in the 1980s, through the efforts of three generations of scientists, China's scientists have received extensive attention and recognition from their international peers. The QIS research represented by Pan enables China to keep pace with the U.S. in this most important technology race and has proved that China is able to create an ecosystem for tech talent to innovate.
Tsung-Dao Lee Institute (TDLI): Can China replicate the DNA of the Bohr Institute?
If Pan’s research has strong practical value, the work of TDLI in Shanghai is closer to basic science research. TDLI is an institute founded by the eminent physicist Tsung-Dao Lee (born 1926)--and named after him. Shanghai Jiaotong University is its trustee. TDLI aims to become China's version of the Niels Bohr Institute, which is located at the University of Copenhagen is renown fr introducing or cultivating future scientists such as Wolfgang E.Pauli (1900-1958) or Werner Karl Heisenberg (1901-1976). Its American counterpart is the Institute for Advanced Study or IAS in Princeton University.
Lee is a Chinese-born American physicist, one of the youngest laureates. Lee received the Nobel Prize for Physics with Chen-Ning Yang (1922 - ) in 1957 for their landmark parity violation theory. Lee promoted collaboration between China and the U.S. in high-energy physics in projects like the Beijing electron-positron collider. In the 1980s, Lee initiated the China-U.S. Physics Examination and Application (CUSPEA) program that educated 915 doctoral students from China. China's population advantage is turning into its talent advantage, and Lee has been helping young Chinese students reach their potential.
TDLI has recruited influential physicists like Frank Wilczek (American physicist, and the 2004 Nobel Laureate in Physics), and Tsutomu Yanagida (Japanese physicist who first proposed the seesaw mechanism). All of TDLI's Chinese scholars have overseas study and/or research experience. Compared with the Bohr Institute or IAS Princeton, its pool of top scholars is not large enough. TDLI has only three divisions: astronomy, high energy physics, and quantum physics, but it has eyes on some basic questions about the nature of the universe, e.g., how did the universe begin, how did stars and galaxies form, and what is  dark matter?
At TDLI, there is an international academic atmosphere and working environment. English is the language of academic exchange, and, on average, there is a seminar or colloquia every two days. Wilczek, the founding director of TDLI and a Nobel Laureate, not only organizes various academic activities, but also frequently communicates with doctoral students in person, e.g., lunch with PhD students, one-on-one dialogues, etc. The culture of TDLI is “no assignment, but opportunity; no performance targets, but responsibilities”. Young scholars are supported by an administrative team to share most of their burden unrelated to research work, and every scholar and postdoctoral fellow has his/her own research project. There is no concept of an administrative level. TDLI serves as an independent center for theoretical research and intellectual inquiry. It is a source of original innovation, a point of convergence of leading scientists, and a launch pad for young scholars.
TDLI is another attempt by China to boost basic science research. As the Chinese proverb says, “it takes ten years to grow trees, but a hundred years to rear people” (十年树木, 百年树人). TDLI is striving "to build itself into a world-renown cradle of original innovation, an exceptional pool of scientists and talented researchers, and a nurturing space for future-inspired, early-career scientists that contribute to the science and innovation in China and beyond." (3)
Besides TDLI, more than a dozen universities in China have established advanced research institutes. The Institute for Advanced Study of Tsinghua University, where Chen-Ning Yang, another 1957 Nobel Laureate in Physics serves as its Honorary Director, is modeled after Princeton's IAS. The model for Tsinghua IAS is almost the same as that of TDLI, and the competition between Yang and Lee has extended to the nurturing of young talent.
Yang settled in China in 2003 and has been working full-time at Tsinghua University ever since. In 2015, Yang renounced his American citizenship and became a Chinese citizen. In 2016, Yang and Andrew Yao (1946 - , computer scientist, Turing Award winner in 2000), a professor at Tsinghua IAS who also relinquished his American citizenship, joined the Chinese Academy of Sciences as academicians－the highest academic title in China.
Nieng Yan – Talent flow or Talent Drain
In contrast to Yang and Yao, the departure of professor Nieng Yan (1977- ) from Tsinghua to Princeton University in 2017 attracted more attention and generated more discussion in China.
Princeton Professor Nieng Yan.
Princeton Professor Nieng Yan.
After completing her undergraduate study in Biological Sciences & Biotechnology at Tsinghua University in 2000, Yan obtained her PhD in Molecular Biology at Princeton University in 2004 and continued her postdoctoral research there until 2007. She then joined the School of Medicine of Tsinghua University, where Yan was the youngest tenured professor and Chair. In May 2017, Yan announced on social media that she would join Princeton University as the Shirley M. Tilghman Professor of Molecular Biology. At Princeton, Yan was elected an International Member of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) in 2019.
There is usually no fuss when an employee leaves a 10-year job for a new one, but Yan has sparked controversy because she had become an icon of the new generation of Chinese scientists. Yan's departure has led to all kinds of repercussions. Some people criticized Yan for forgetting the patriotic words of her doctoral advisor Yigong Shi(1967-), who resigned from Princeton and joined Tsinghua in 2007 and others suspected that Yan ran away because she failed a fund application from the National Natural Science Foundation of China for two consecutive years. From these comments, we can see the backlog of dissatisfaction with China's technology system as well as nationalist sentiment.
Regarding her move to Princeton, Yan described her move as "a change of environment, to give me some new pressure and stimulate myself for new inspiration". The official gestures of China appeared to be open and positive. Tsinghua University said that the move will help to spread the educational philosophy of China and Tsinghua's academic style. The China Association for Science and Technology saw Yan's move a norm of talent flow and recognition of China's scientific and technological rank. Yan's back and forth between Tsinghua and Princeton can be regarded as a footnote to the improvement of China's higher education. After ten years at Tsinghua, Yan's genius would have already been wasted were the academic quality of Tsinghua not good enough. How could Yan be recruited by Princeton as a tenured full professor?
The world is NOT flat when it comes to scientific research, developed countries have a siphon effect on talents from developing countries. Patriotism may have influenced Chen-Ning Yang, Andrew Yao and Yigong Shi, but today the logic of  coming back to China is not only emotional, it is practical. After returning to China in 2007 at the age of 30, Yan had her own independent laboratory. Her most outstanding academic achievements so far were made during her Tsinghua period.
A liberal and open-minded scientific research community will greatly promote international cooperation of science research projects andtheinternational exchange of scholars. If a country destroys free international academic exchanges and cooperation, its attractiveness to talent will be greatly reduced, and will ultimately erodes its competitiveness.
A Few Final Notes
Let's be clear, the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS) are *not* propaganda machines. They are academic, degree-granting institutions that engage in and fund important research and take positions on the direction of the Chinese economy and society. CASS does not equal the Heritage Foundation or the Brookings Institution. They are more closely aligned with the National Academy of Sciences or the National Institutes of Health in the United States. While they do have political biases that derive from their funder (the Party), they are also serious research institutions and deserve to be taken seriously.
Second, it is important that we think broadly about talent development as it spreads and develops across China. If we are asked to nominate one scientist who can represent the height of scientific innovation, we might pick a key industry player in the supply chain (and this is just one example of many).
Here is an example: people often think of the iPhone as one of the key innovations of the 2000s. But when we push deeper, we might arrive at the idea that the key innovation of the iPhone was not just a handheld device (this existed already, e.g., the Blackberry). Some would argue that the key innovation was touchscreen glass. And this idea was indeed the brainchild of Apple CEO Steve Jobs. However, there is a difference between an idea and then scaling that idea through a manufacturing process. Jobs had the idea, but Zhou Qunfei, CEO of Lens, Inc., and currently the wealthiest woman in China, is the CEO of the factory that figured out how to scale this process and bring it to life for the world. And following this collaborative innovation in China’s manufacturing supply chain, an entire talent pool of  science around the scaling of the production of touchscreen glass has emerged. Our point here, is that there are many levels of science, innovation, and talent development that have come to life in China over the last forty years.
The Tech Rivalry
The cultivation and growth of talent in scientific research is a lengthy process, and it requires long-term investment and continued support. The successes of many Chinese scientists in the West have proved that the Chinese do not have any cultural barriers or capability deficits in science. If the scientific research in Einstein's time was the theoretical study that drove experimental research, in the 21st century, experimental research is taking the lead. In this regard, strong supply chain capabilities give China some advantages, not to mention its top-down rapid decision-making. In scientific research, who is first to a discovery matters the most. There is also a school of thought that advances in science and technology could only be made in free societies by free thinkers, so China cannot innovate because it is an authoritarian regime behind a firewall. This is certainly is not correct the cases discussed in this article.
The global technological leadership of the U.S. is largely due to its ability to attract talent. In the name of national security, Donald Trump undermined the open research environment in America, where scholars and students with Chinese heritage were welcomed. Instead, these scholars were profiled. An example f this is the arrest of Professor Gang Chen, a U.S. citizen, widely respected scholar, teacher, and member of the MIT faculty since 2001, by the FBI in 2021 on allegations of federal grant fraud. The charges were dismissed, but the pain lingered.
The Paulson Institute reports China produced 29% of the top artificial intelligence (AI) researchers. Nearly nine out of ten Chinese students earning AI doctorates in America go to work in America (4). While Beijing is seeking to harness China’s finest minds and technological strengths to become a leading innovative country, if America no longer welcomes Chinese researchers and students, China will embrace them with open arms. Scientific research knows no borders, but scientists want to find a place where they belong.
Today China and the U.S. are in "the Great Tech Rivalry". Although China's scientific and technological strength has increased in recent years, the U.S. is still the world leader. However, if the so-called decoupling of technology between the U.S. and China occurs, the U.S. is at risk of isolating itself while China will remain open to the rest of the world. Although in the short run, China will suffer because the U.S. has the advantage. Once China succeeds in building a de-Americanized tech ecosystem, the damage to the U.S. will be catastrophic and lasting. Therefore, while the two countries are competing against each other, the optimal strategy is still to seek a win-win with open and inclusive minds, just as the spirit Niels Bohr Institute has honored for 100 years: “international collaboration is in focus”.
1. Youyou Tu (1930-) is China's first local Nobel laureate in science (2015 in Physiology or Medicine). Chen-Ning Yang, Tsung-Dao Lee held the ROC passport when they won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1957, but because their award-winning research work was done in the United States, China does not recognize them as native Nobel laureates.
2. QCT is the first public listed Chinese company in quantum information science. It was established in 2009 and went public in July 2020, its current market value is about ￥10 billion or US$ 160 million. USTC is its largest shareholder (19.2%), and Jianwei Pan holds 8.26%.
