### Race, Equity, and Justice: Resource Guides for Leadership

25 June 2020|Diversity & Inclusion, Leadership, Leadership Development
AtOn Global Leadership, we pride ourselves on being thought leaders on a variety of issues, particularly leadership and management development, but we also see ourselves as a valuable resource for our readers. In this latest column from our Leadership Editor David Slocum, David shares critical online resources to help business leaders speak and act knowledgeably about race, diversity, and inclusion in the workplace.
This article is a companion to an earlierOn Global Leadershipposting on “Leading Through Days of Rage, Grief, and Discord.” That piece offered research-based recommendations and successful precedents to business leaders needing to address the immediate emotional and psychological impact on workers and workplaces of the death of George Floyd and the resulting protests about racial injustice in the United States. Nearly a month later, following continuing global calls for systemic changes to various structures of institutional racism and persistent inequality, including in many longstanding business practices, a host of valuable resource guides have emerged to help leaders drive that change.
Most of these guides contain links to dozens or even hundreds of items. Those resources include articles and books, fictional and documentary films, websites and blogs, podcasts, social media accounts, and organizational contacts. They cover a wide range of vital and often challenging leadership topics: having difficult conversations about race and racism within the workplace and in communities; ensuring availability of appropriate mental health and other support services for employees; taking actions to prioritize hiring, retention, and promotion of people of color; changing training and development programs; speaking out, becoming an ally, and modeling anti-racist behavior; and, educating oneself and others about the historical, social, and economic contexts of race, racism and privilege. Unsurprisingly, several key resources are repeatedly cited in these guides.
It’s important to emphasize that these guides primarily describe resources meant to support business leaders. While that translates in most instances into a focus on business and corporate settings and interactions, the more general priorities of learning about different perspectives on race and about systematic social and economic racism also thread through these links. Readers working in specific industries (e.g., marketing) and professional disciplines (e.g., HR/Talent Management) should look to their companies and to industry or professional associations for more targeted resources. Other sources of expertise are dedicated DEI firms likeParadigmandJennifer Brown Consultingthat have been producing valuable new insights and thought and practice leadership as the current crisis has developed.
The Academy of Management created a special “Racism, Equality & Ethics” online issue containing dozens of articles and insight pieces for business leaders, students, policymakers, and other stakeholders. Drawn from academic and management research, the readings are grouped under the topics, “Uprooting Racism,” “Promoting Equality,” and “Addressing Ethics.”
B Corps, a community of responsible business leaders driving a global movement of people using business as a force for good, has compiled hundreds of “Anti-Racism Resources.” As part of its commitment to building an inclusive and sustainable economic system, the resources detail ways that both organizations and individuals can take action to address the injustice, inequity, and violence that disproportionately impact Black people and other people of color.
The Editors of theHarvard Business Review(HBR) have gathered a collection of 15 HBR articles, “Confronting Racism at Work: A Reading List,” that addresses how business leaders and companies can fight racism, support Black employees, engage and reduce bias, and improve efforts at building inclusion.
The Harvard Medical School Office for Diversity Inclusion & Community Partnership maintains a helpful webpage of links to dozens of Anti-Racism Resources. These include writings, videos, and webinars that range widely from strategies for leaders to learning about systemic racism to raising anti-racist children.
Writer Alyssa Klein and activist and filmmaker Sarah Sophie Flickercompiled a public Google document with over 75 Anti-Racism Resources for white people and parents to deepen their anti-racism work. The listing was initially produced in late May and was one of the earliest guides circulated following George Floyd’s death.
Notion, which launched the eponymous online workspace tool, has produced an “Anti-Racism Guide” of more than 100 items that is regularly updated. Besides writings, films and videos, and podcasts, the guide includes organizations to follow and actions/tips that contribute to meaningful change.
RacialEquityTools.orgis a website that provides more than 2,500 resources – tools, research, ideas and tips, and curricula – to help families, businesses and other organizations, and communities to increase their understanding and achieve racial justice. The product of a partnership among the Center for Assessment and Policy Development, MP Associates, and World Trust Educational Services, the site has received support from several foundations and the Aspen Institute.
TED.comhas organized a topic page on “Race” that lists a wide range of TEDTalks, interviews, and exclusive articles about racism, social justice, and leading inclusion in organizations. Most of the 75 video TEDTalks include transcripts and references, and several of the additional 87 talks have been posted in the last month and address current protests and opportunities for taking meaningful action.
Vienna Global Leaders, a platform built by the Eunepa consulting group, has put together an excellent summary of practical steps for leaders to pursue during this crisis. They’ve also created a listing of dozens of materials that describe “How Global Business Leaders Can Take Action Against Racism.”
Women Who Do Stuff, a French feminist association, compiled a list of nearly 200 French (or Francophone) resources (“Ressources anti-racistes à destination des personnes blanches”) to help “white people realize that racism is everyone's business, so that we can educate ourselves and act.” Acknowledging the important cultural and political differences between France and the United States, the resources can provide (for readers of French) additional perspectives on race and racism and illustrate the value of engaging and learning from diverse models and experiences.
