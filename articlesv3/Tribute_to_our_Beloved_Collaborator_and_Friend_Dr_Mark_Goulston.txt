### Tribute to our Beloved Collaborator and Friend Dr. Mark Goulston

2 January 2024|Coaching, Creative Leadership, Deeper Coaching Institute
At On Global Leadership, we strive to make the world a little bit better, one step at a time, a few words at a time. We have been fortunate to have a team of people who respect and admire each other as we have built our presence in the world of creative leadership. This week we lost our dear friend, colleague, and collaborator Dr. Mark Goulston. Mark died on Saturday, Dec. 30, 2023, due to an unforeseen infection during recovery from a bone marrow transplant. It is with a heavy heart that we pay tribute to Mark and celebrate his life and the beautiful example he set for all of us.
The world will deeply miss Dr. Mark Goulston's presence and voice. And we will deeply miss his friendship, insights, generosity, and collaboration. It is with great sorrow that we share out thoughts about our dear friend. Some posts are joyous to write – an idea comes into your mind, one you want to share with the world, and you sit down to write, and the words just flow. This post is different.
Mark was a deeply insightful person with a truly generous soul. Although I have only known Mark for about two years, I can confidently say that the time I spent in friendship and collaboration with Mark has changed my life and my future. He was just that kind of person.
Mark possessed a magical mixture of quiet, inquisitive, and penetrating insight on the one hand and a deep sense of humility on the other. But it wasn’t false humility. It was real, honest, and true. In my time spent with Mark, this was his greatest gift, his greatest talent – to be able to channel his incisive insights to take people deep into self-reflective conversations while cloaking those insights in a humility that made those around him feel safe.
This post is about Mark, a tribute to his life, a celebration of his generous soul, but let me begin by briefly recounting the story of how we met and how Mark changed my life in the short time we have known each other.
The last five years have not been the best years of my life, a period of significant pain and self-reflection. One of the saving gifts of this period came when I was invited into the community founded by Marshall Goldsmith, 100 Coaches, and it is where I met Mark. Marshall has built a magical community, where an amazing concentration of brilliant, wildly impressive, yet surprisingly humble people come together to support each other in their common interests in making the world a better place. Mark was a quiet star in this group of amazing people.
In addition to our large community calls, we are also invited to join smaller groups, usually with 10 members or fewer, to aid in our coming to know each other and share ideas on a deeper level. It is in one of these groups that I first encountered Mark. Each week, one of the members shares his or her story – the significant moments of their lives, what helped them form their leadership and coaching philosophies, their goals for the future, how they think about changing the world in some way. When it was my turn, I was nervous. Mark and colleagues had made me feel so safe that I decided to go all in, talking about secrets that I usually keep separate from my professional life. I talked about a lifetime of mental health issues, a few key moments of suicidal ideation, my closest brush with ending the pain; and a serious attempt to rebuild my life and think about how I might use the experiences to be a better coach.
After my presentation, Mark wrote me immediately in the Zoom chat: “We need to talk. Please call me as soon as you can. Here is my mobile number. Call me right away…” It sounded serious. I wasn’t sure if I had offended him in some way, perhaps overstepped some unspoken boundary. But I didn’t know Mark well and did not understand that he was not only a generous listener; he had also spent his entire professional life thinking about suicidal ideation. Mark had spent his career saving lives. He was an expert in this field. Humbly listening, asking pointed questions at the perfect moment, nudging the conversational partner toward a path that sought and illuminated a deeper truth. That was Mark’s vocation. And he was really good at it.
As soon as I got on the call with Mark, I could tell this was not a casual support call. It was more serious. Quickly, Mark cut to the chase: “Doug, we are going to be friends, close friends. This is just the first of many calls we are going to have going forward. And I need you to stop being afraid of talking about your journey. Together, we are going to talk this through, and you are going to write a book about this journey. We are in this together, my friend.” I stammered a bit, trying to digest what I was hearing, but then meekly said, “OK. When should we talk next?”
From that moment on, Mark quickly became one of the closest professional friends I had, one of the closest professional friends I have ever had. We talked at least once a week. We shared thoughts, fears, big aspirations. I know I got much more out of the calls and the friendship than Mark ever could, and sometimes I felt sheepish about Mark giving me so much of his time. Once I asked him about it, and he cut me off quickly, anticipating where I was going and setting my heart and mind at ease: “Doug, I knew you were going to ask me about this. Let me assure you, I get just as much out of our friendship and weekly meetings as you do. We have work to do together, my friend, so let’s get to it.”
From then on, our calls would traverse the territories of  personal feelings, fears, ambitions, disappointments, and lingering goals. It was a new model of professional friendship – professional friendship without boundaries, professional friendship with courageous sharing. Mark brought new ideas, we discussed them, we published them on this blog, where Mark would introduce readers to the “third rail” – those areas of life that we are sometimes afraid to talk about (for a few of Mark’s most recent brilliant musing seehere,here,here). We formed a loose alliance, theDeeper Coaching Institute, to share coaching philosophies and to establish coaching relationships that would invite others to go deep into the territories we often pretend do not belong in the professional world.
Mark was fearless in these conversations, I guess, following a lifetime of pushing clients and friends to think more deeply about the thoughts and fears that governed their lives, he had earned the right to be fearless. It was very inspiring, and he shared these ideas widely. He was a best-selling author (Just Listen) and produced a beautiful podcast series (My Wakeup Call).
One inspiring sidenote: Mark strangely became more productive when he became sick. We would talk about it often.
Doug:“Mark, you are on a tear. You know you can slow downa bit if you need to…”
Mark: “I have so much to share right now, a deeper different perspective, and so little time…”
Instead of feeling morose or sorry for himself, he wanted to share so much more with the world. His”I’m Dying To Tell You” podcastwas truly inspirational, as were his My Wakeup Call Podcast series, which preceded it. (If you Google theI’m Dying to Tell Youseries, you will see Mark working from his hospital bed for the most recent editions…) All I can say is: inspiring…gracefully inspiring.
When I think about Mark and the two years of friendship, here is what I remember:
Fearlessness, Honesty, and Safety: When I think about the conversations I had with Mark over the last two years, there was always a sense of balance between fearlessness and safety. We could throw caution to the wind, be totally honest with each other, and explore the depths of what we were thinking and feeling. We could be completely fearless in exploring these depths. We would not be worried about being judged, because we were prioritizing being open and honest about the psychological tendencies and predispositions that had brought us to this conversation. But these were not just unstructured bull sessions. There was a purpose here: to reach a breakthrough that would allow us to be better coaches, better friends, and better people. But in being fearless with honesty in self-reflection, collaborators and friends must create safe spaces. Mark was fabulous at creating this sense of safety.
Structure, generosity with time, and follow through: These conversations and their cadence had structure. Mark wouldn’t allow us to simply sign off a weekly call, “OK, talk to you soon…” There was always a schedule for the weekly call and a confirmation that we were going to talk again next week and at this time. But it wasn’t just about scheduling time. There was often an implicit and sometimes explicit tie into what this conversation was helping us work through. Often, Mark would say, “I have a new title for your book… I am really good at titles, you know, so let me try this one on for you…” More discussion, then: “You really do need to write this book. How are we going to advance this project together.” Or there was an idea of an institute that would push the field of coaching into the realm of deeper coaching, and the next thing you know, there is text for a proposal for something called the Deeper Coaching Institute.
Or there was the time we had talked about a new project on leadership teaching and coaching for Returning Citizens. The next thing I knew, within a week, Mark had introduced me to and set up calls with four different people who radically changed the direction and momentum of the project. And when I reached out and asked him if he would have a conversation with one of my collaborators in this space, it was done.
Humility: Mark exuded humility, and he led by example in this realm. He talked often and openly about his struggles in medical school, about dropping out and returning, about self-doubt, and about the ways in which early failures shaped his subsequent professional life. Such humility was truly inspirational, and it helped me think about the ways in which my failures and recent struggles could be approached openly, helping to make others feel at ease.
Anticipation or Seeing Around Corners: More than once I had conversations with Mark when his answer began, “I knew this was coming.” But it was never presented in a haughty way; it was always more like, “I thought you might go down this road, and I have given this some thought.” It always made the tension I was feeling dissipate in some way. It was an interesting gift, and what it said to the conversation partner was: “I am here, I am listening, I am thinking about where this is going…” And what I thought would be a big issue or concern would suddenly feel less so. This, I think, is the practice of a profoundly attentive listener, and that Mark was. (Not so surprising, I guess, coming from the author ofJust Listen.)
Love: Growing up with so much self-doubt, I have learned to express love to kids and close friends as much as possible. But there has always been a bright line between family and close friendships and the decorum of professional relationships – expressions of love are for family and close personal friendships but do not belong in professional relationships. But not with Mark. He quickly had no problem ending calls with “I love you.” It soon felt completely natural to express thankfulness and love for each other. That was all Mark.
I could go on. But I hope what is clear here is that, through our mourning, we also celebrate the life of a humble, fearless, loving intellect. A brilliant force in the intricate terrain of complex human emotion and psychology but also the intellectual pursuit of a way forward in helping people live better lives. We will miss you, Dr. Goulston, but your memory and presence will live on with us. Thank you for the many gifts, insights, humility, and love you shared. We won’t forget.
