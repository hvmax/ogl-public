### Real Time: Notes on Recent U.S.-China Relations

26 April 2023|China, China history, China politics
On Global Leadership's regular feature, OGL Real Time, presents our up-to-the-minute insights on current news and events. We hope these breaking news insights from our OGL team members will help illuminate the events of the day and provide the depth needed to understand global political, economic and cultural transitions and transformations. In this post, we examine U.S.-China relations in recent history and how moves by both the United States and China have created schisms between the two countries. This Real Time Q&A considers those recent activities and attitudes and their impact.
From the OGL Team
Thomas Friedman, a New York Times columnist and author of the best-selling book “The World Is Flat”, attended the China Development Forum 2023 Annual Meeting in Beijing recently. It was his first visit to China since the COVID outbreak in 2020. After leaving China, Friedman published a lengthy article,America, China and a Crisis of Trust.What did people in China think of this illuminating article?
At this critical moment in U.S.-China relations, the article opened up a realistic conversation about how these two superpowers can operate today and going forward. Reactions were both negative and positive:
TheGlobal Times, an English-language Chinese newspaper with a circulation of 2 million, extracted and translated Friedman's article, which then was reposted by other important Chinese social media such as Sina. Hu Xijin, the former editor-in-chief of theGlobal Times, with almost 25 million followers on Weibo, China’s equivalent of Twitter, blogged about his recent meeting with Friedman in Beijing.
Though the translation doesn’t include Friedman’s harsh words about China, a more complete version of the column can be found on other non-mainstream social media. The general interpretation is that Friedman believes that when it comes to trust between the two counties, China deserves more blame than the United States. Since China has lost trust, the author understands and supports U.S. sanctions against China on deep technology goods like chips. However, Friedman makes it clear that the two countries are too deeply intertwined with each other to undermine the entire relationship, and the consequences of a military conflict will be too dire.
On Chinese social media, most comments were negative, and many criticized Friedman being arrogant and prejudiced. Others argued that the column reflected a certain political correctness in the United States, where talking about China in public requires more criticism than praise.
What are Friedman's new observations?
Being back on the ground in China after his long absence and being able "to observe China again through a larger aperture than a pinhole”, Friedman had a number of positive reflections about China and its current status in his article. Those conclusions included:
“I can’t think of any major nation after the United States with more of a Protestant work ethic and naturally capitalist population than China”.While “China’s Communist Party government has a stronger grip than ever on its society”, the party and the state has built “world-class infrastructure and public goods that make life for China’s middle and lower classes steadily better”.“Beijing and Shanghai, in particular, have become very livable cities, with the air pollution largely erased and lots of new, walkable green spaces”.“China’s stability is a product of both an increasingly pervasive police state and a government that has steadily raised standards of living”.“In today’s fused world, the notion that China can economically collapse and America still thrives is utter fantasy”.
• “I can’t think of any major nation after the United States with more of a Protestant work ethic and naturally capitalist population than China”.
• While “China’s Communist Party government has a stronger grip than ever on its society”, the party and the state has built “world-class infrastructure and public goods that make life for China’s middle and lower classes steadily better”.
• “Beijing and Shanghai, in particular, have become very livable cities, with the air pollution largely erased and lots of new, walkable green spaces”.
• “China’s stability is a product of both an increasingly pervasive police state and a government that has steadily raised standards of living”.
• “In today’s fused world, the notion that China can economically collapse and America still thrives is utter fantasy”.
On his meeting with Friedman, Hu blogged: “Because of COVID, Mr. Friedman has not been to China for a long time. He said that before the trip, he had heard a lot of (bad) comments about China, and he was very worried and pessimistic about China-U.S. relations, but after this trip and having many conversations, he is now much more optimistic than when he was in America. He believes that China and the United States are destined to be inseparable.”
While Hu didn't say what he told Friedman, claiming it didn't matter, we know from Friedman's op-ed that there were some important messages:“We (Chinese) never thought China-U.S. relations would ever become so bad. Now we gradually accept the situation, and most Chinese people think there is no hope for better relations. We think the relationship will be worse and worse and hope that war will not break out between our two countries.”
Friedman has waded into a complex diplomatic situation, which is why his column has reverberated so much from Beijing to Washington. What factors have contributed to this moment?
As we’ve noted in past posts, this moment is the result of two years of problematic diplomacy. U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan said in early March that the United States wanted to re-establish regular communication with China, and President Joe Biden expected to talk with President Xi by telephone sometime after China's two sessions (ended March 13, 2023). Secretary of State Antony Blinken wanted to reschedule his postponed trip to Beijing, which was abruptly cancelled because of the balloon crisis in February. Other trips to Beijing that are being talked about would include Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo. The Pentagon claims it has been trying to talk to their Chinese counterpart amid high tensions between the two countries. But none of these have happened or been confirmed.
At the G7 Foreign Ministers' Meeting in Japan, Blinken called out to China that he still wanted to make the trip to the mainland because “countries around the world expect U.S. to manage the relationship with China responsibly”. However, it looks like China does not have the intention for now of meeting with U.S. representatives, because Beijing doesn’t want to entertain “insincere people” from Washington.
Over the course of three presidencies (Obama, Trump, and Biden) and five years, U.S. policy shifted from constructive engagement to competition. In his first foreign policy speech after taking office in 2021, Blinken offered a new China policy framework for the Biden administration: “competitive when it should be, collaborative when it can be and adversarial when it must be”, which was dubbed the “3C framework” (compete, cooperate and confront). China was described as the only country with the economic, diplomatic, military, and technological power to seriously challenge the stable and open international system.
Since then, all of China's diplomatic efforts have been aimed at changing Washington's narrative of the bilateral relationship, putting collaboration ahead of competition. Obviously, these efforts have not reached the desired result. At the summit in Bali in November 2022, the Chinese President Xi made another attempt by expressing his dissatisfaction to President Biden in person:
On Taiwan. “Mr. President has repeatedly said that you do not support ‘Taiwan independence’ and have no intention of using Taiwan as a tool to seek competitive advantage over China or contain China. I hope that that the U.S. side will implement Mr. President's promise.”On the United States trying to topple Chinese’s political system. “The U.S. side should honor its commitments with concrete action instead of talking in one way and acting in another...”
• On Taiwan. “Mr. President has repeatedly said that you do not support ‘Taiwan independence’ and have no intention of using Taiwan as a tool to seek competitive advantage over China or contain China. I hope that that the U.S. side will implement Mr. President's promise.”
• On the United States trying to topple Chinese’s political system. “The U.S. side should honor its commitments with concrete action instead of talking in one way and acting in another...”
After the balloon crisis, Washington canceled Blinken's visit to China. On February 18, in an informal contact with Secretary Blinken on the margins of the 59th Munich Security Conference, China's top diplomat Wang Yi made a request: the U.S. side “change course (and) acknowledge and repair the damage that its excessive use of force caused to China-US relations”. Two weeks later at China's two sessions meetings, the Chinese top leader publicly criticized Washington by name: “Western countries headed by the United States have contained, encircled and suppressed China in an all-round way, bringing unprecedented severe challenges to China's development”.
Lately, President Xi and his foreign policy establishment seems willing and eager to meet with a variety of world leaders, both in China and at various geopolitical and economic meetings. But Beijing seems to have an “anybody but America” attitude in scheduling these visits with world leaders. Is Beijing purposefully neglecting Washington?
Statements from China’s foreign policy leaders have established a public showdown, a decision that requires a determination to made, and its impact will be long-lasting and far-reaching. A series of diplomatic actions by Beijing pushed Washington to the sidelines and showed the world that although China-U.S. relations are important, they are NOT the only story for Beijing to follow.
In-person meetings between President Xi and the presidents of Russia, France, and Brazil, among many others, sent a very clear message that China is not hobbled by U.S. relations and has the ability to meet with other leaders to advance trade and security relationships.
There have been more friendly entreaties to China by U.S. leaders in recent weeks. Do they signal a renewed interest in U.S.-China talks and how will Beijing respond to these appeals from Biden administration leaders?
A common saying in Chinese diplomacy is “listen to their words and observe their actions” (听其言，观其行). But today, words from Washington are just not enough. “They seem to have the view that crisis communications will be an excuse for the United States to create more crises, so that we can then manage them,” said the Pentagon’s Colin Kahl, undersecretary of defense for policy in an interview withForeign Policy.
In a speech at Johns Hopkins University’s School of Advanced International Studies in Washington on April 20, 2023, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said she and President Biden don't see the relationship between the U.S. and China as a zero-sum, bilateral contest where one must fall for the other to rise. The world is big enough for both China and the United States, and the two countries can and need to find a way to live together and share in global prosperity. For the first time, Yellen put cooperation ahead of competition since Blinken announced the “3C framework”.
But we are afraid this will not get Yellen to Beijing either. Washington has a set of policies and measures in the pipeline to curtail Beijing’s technological and military rise, "unprecedented rules" limiting American investment in China, a 90-day "sprint" by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security Department is around the corner. Apparently, the containment and suppression of China is showing no signs of easing.
Is there any diplomatic opportunities for Washington to restart high-level exchanges between the two countries and to build a stronger relationship in the future?
Between the U.S. and China, there is deep mutual suspicion and fundamental mistrust, like Thomas Friedman described in his recent article, "Americans and Chinese remind me of Israelis and Palestinians in one respect: They are both expert at aggravating the other’s deepest insecurities". Keeping relations from deteriorating further should be China's greatest expectation of President Biden for the remainder of his term.
A few suggestions for rebuilding the important relationships between the U.S. and China:
Increase the number of airline flights between China and the United States to facilitate personnel exchanges;Partially remove Trump's special tariffs on Chinese products;Perhaps remove the Chinese Defense Minister off the U.S. sanctions list might also be considered
• Increase the number of airline flights between China and the United States to facilitate personnel exchanges;
• Partially remove Trump's special tariffs on Chinese products;
• Perhaps remove the Chinese Defense Minister off the U.S. sanctions list might also be considered
At the same time, Beijing should not shy away from high-level exchanges, at least on mutually acceptable topics such as climate change.
Finally, now that trade is no longer the "ballast stone" of China-U.S. relations, we need a replacement. Our suggestion is, quite simply,PEACE.
In the twentieth century, human beings experienced two world wars, and in the 21st century, a war between China and the United States will become global catastrophe. The people of China and the United States do not want conflict; the people of our world want peace and development. The leaders and politicians of the two countries should demonstrate their wisdom and vision, and shoulder the responsibilities and obligations as the leaders of major world powers.
When two sides are in tense relationship, misjudging the actions and goals of the other side will affect the policy making and result in wrong decisions. The Korean War 73 years ago was a meaningless military conflict between China and the United States (see post here). The war caused millions of casualties, and the 38th parallel, the imaginary line drawn by the combatants and where the two sides finally ceased fire, was both the ending and the starting line of the war.
Now, we have come to another crucial moment. As American writer Nicholas Kristof wrote in his new article,How to Avoid a War with China, “it’s time for both sides to take a deep breath and step back”. The politics can seem highly symbolic at times, but symbols have power, and we must know where boundaries can be drawn for both countries.
