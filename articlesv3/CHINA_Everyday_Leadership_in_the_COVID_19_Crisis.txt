### CHINA: Everyday Leadership in the COVID-19 Crisis

By The On Global Leadership Team
We are a team of researchers with experiences and expertise that range from market entry and supply chain management in China to the study of leadership in organizations, politics, and business. The current global crisis creates an interesting moment in which several of these issues have flowed together. The bickering, blaming, finger pointing and proclamations of good and bad leadership through this crisis seems to scream for an analysis of what good leadership looks like in this moment of crisis.
We think we have something to say about this, but our answer is perhaps a little bit off the beaten path. When I teach leadership in my executive education classes, I always begin with a simple question: “Name one leader you admire and tell us why you admire that person.” The answers are usually predictable. Steve Jobs, Tim Cook, Barak Obama, Angela Merkel, Tom Brady; if I am teaching in China, Deng Xiaoping’s name inevitably comes up; sometimes Mao Zedong; Jack Ma, Pony Ma; Lee Kuan Yew. The list goes on, and I am sure you can guess many of the other names. I always close the exercise with the following observation: “These are all amazing people. Amazing leaders in a diverse set of political environments, sectors, industries. They are all people who rose by force of will or charisma or brilliance to the pinnacle of their fields of work. I am curious though: What is it about the word or concept of leadership that makes us only think about powerful people at the top of a pyramid? It is interesting that none of you mentioned your mom or your dad or your high school baseball coach.” I usually then go on to tell the story of the person who probably had the biggest impact on my life – my 11th Grade High School English Teacher and talk about why I think she is the greatest leader I ever encountered.
I then introduce our view ofEveryday Leadership, which is pretty simple, but we believe profound: Leadership is not about the position you are in or the peak you have scaled in your career;it is about how you show up in your life every day, regardless of the position you are in. How you serve your organization, your society, your country, the people around you in your daily life is so much more important in leadership than what the famous heads of state and heads of corporations do. In effect, we are trying to turn the field of leadership on its head – instead of teaching people to focus on what they might do when they finally achieve that pinnacle of leadership, we seek to push people to what leadership means in their everyday lives and everyday moments today, right now. We believe this is the essence of leadership.
So, back to the Coronavirus and the current world crisis. And back to China. Again, lots of blame, lots of finger pointing. President Xi did this wrong; President Xi did this right; President Trump did this wrong; President Trump did this right; Governor Cuomo is showing real leadership. And we could weigh in on the actions of each and every one of these. But we won’t. Instead, we’d like to engage our readers with some stories of everyday leadership in China.
The Story of Wang Yong (汪勇)
Wang Yong is a native of Wuhan, who works as a courier. As reported in the China Daily (Kang Jia | chinadaily.com.cn | 2020-02-18), “At 10 pm on Lunar New Year’s Eve, Wang, who was on Spring Festival holiday, learned from his WeChat Moments that a nurse at Jinyintan Hospital couldn’t find a taxi to drive her home while bus and subway services were suspended in the area near the hospital. Since the outbreak of the novel coronavirus in Wuhan, Jinyintan Hospital, which specializes in infectious diseases, had played a significant role in treating patients confirmed with the novel coronavirus pneumonia. Many taxi drivers didn’t want to take the risk of going there. Enter Mr. Wang, a paragon of everyday leadership. Wang bought two N95 masks from a nearby supermarket and arrived at Jinyintan Hospital at 6 am the next day. The nurse didn’t expect that anyone would come. She got in the car and burst into tears. On that day, Wang drove a total of nearly 30 medical staff members to and from Jinyintan Hospital. But that was only the beginning…”
We love this story. No one told Mr. Wang that he had to do this. He just knew that he had to contribute what he could to make the world he inhabited a better place. This is Everyday Leadership. Perhaps Mr. Wang was inspired by some leader higher up in the hierarchy. But he was one citizen among many who were presented with the same words and exhortations. Yet, there was something in him, some leadership quality, that propelled him to extraordinary ends.#EverydayLeadership.
The Story of Nancy* (*a pseudonym)
Nancy, an entrepreneur is a long-term resident of Shanghai, having lived in Shanghai for 17 years. Her first job was as a bank employee. When she moved to Shanghai her son, James, was 7 years old. Eventually Nancy started her own company selling yarn. When she first heard of the new Coronavirus in Wuhan, it hit her on a personal level, as she her son’s fiancé, Emma, was in Wuhan finishing her master’s thesis. (Emma's mother is head nurse of a traditional Chinese medical hospital.) Nancy felt personally connected through her other relatives as well. Very early on, she started to hear that the number of people coming to the ICUs was growing daily; people were dying. From everything she heard, the need for protective equipment was so great. She immediately put her experience as a sourcing, procurement, and logistics business owner into action – she and her son, James, began sourcing medical supplies. The problem as how to ship to Wuhan with the city and province going into serious lockdown. On the first day of the Wuhan lockdown, James still could source the masks from and online shop he found and sent them to Wuhan hospitals directly. But that did not last long. It was a crisis, and the hospitals were in great shortage of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE).
Nancy was able to identify a train line that left Shanghai and passed through Wuhan, on Jan 24th, the eve of Chinese New Year (CNY). The next day, Wuhan announced the lockdown; Wuhan was first but the lockdown would soon to be applied to the rest Hubei. Nancy and another Hubeinese volunteer in Shanghai accompanied the boxes of masks and sent them to the Shanghai South train station. They got the shipment on to the train platform and onto the train, coordinating with her friends and relatives to have someone receive the shipment in Ezhou a city just around 60km from Wuhan. More and more volunteers got involved. Many of them wanted to support Wuhan and other cities of Hubei. But as the city had been on lockdown, it was difficult to find a good way to send the needed material to Hubei. Nancy and James continued to receive support from the Shanghai South train station luggage department. They shared these logistics with other groups, and continued to arrange the transportation to Wuhan. The goods were transferred to the hospitals directly and arrived the following day. It is almost the fastest way to deliver goods to Wuhan. They called themselves “capillaries”: “the system is small, but it runs well.” With different donations, through these “capillaries,” they have sent masks, protection suits, testing reagent, sanitizer, bread, fast food, bread.

The Cost of a Can of Coke
This is a  story about medical assistance team sent to Wuhan from Shanghai Huashan Hospital (上海华山医院) from a nurse in the team. In Wuhan, their team was assigned to take care of an ICU. Their ICU ward had 30 beds, standard workload is 180 nurses, 6 shifts in one day. One shift worked 4 hours in the ward one day, but it took 2 hours for each shift to put on or turn off protective suits, so total 4 hours changing clothes. The changing process is very strict, only two people can change in the same time. They had to work 6 hours per shift because of short of nurses. As the team was on loan from Shanghai, they stayed in a Wuhan hotel. Some nurses liked to drink Coca-Cola. But to them, the price of Coke in hotel mini-bar is way too expensive – 38 rmb/can. In Shanghai, the price is around 3 rmb/can in a regular supermarket So Coca-Cola was on the nursing staff’s wish list to hospital headquarters in Shanghai – send over Cokes as well as other medical supplies. The hospital leader saw the list and approved a special allowance to include Coke in their menu – allowing the nurses to drink as much Coke as they wanted or needed. People think of leadership in terms of vision, charisma, courage, or heroism. To us, the management of Huashan Hospital showed their quiet leadership by providing the right support and making their medical team feel supported for their work in Wuhan. Sometimes even the most mundane acts can be examples of great leadership moments.#MundaneActsAreLeadershipToo.

The Soldiers and Heroes of this Crisis
One final story, one that takes us out of China, however. We would be remiss in this discussion if we did not mention the amazing leadership of those who are putting their lives on the line everyday. There are many in China but there are also many all around the world. This story comes to us from the Washington Post (Eli Saslow, April 5, 2020), and it is the story of one of the many many caretakers who are putting their lives on the line to care for those in need in this crisis. This is the story of Cory Deburghgraeve, a doctor manning the frontlines, working 14 hour shifts, performing intubations, saving lives, and, yes, watching people die. Reading his very personal account is both heartfelt and heart wrenching, giving a graphic sense of what it is like to work the front lines of a crisis like this. Also an amazing moment of the service and humility of true leadership. As Cory tells the story of his frontline involvement: "Our team had a meeting on March 16th to figure out a staffing plan, once it was clear where this was going. Chicago’s becoming a hot spot now. Our ICU is almost full with covid patients... Everyone basically agreed we should dedicate one person to covid intubations during the day and another at night, and I started thinking: I’m 33 years old. I don’t have any kids at home. I don’t live with older relatives. About an hour after the meeting, I emailed my supervisor: I’m happy to do this. It should be me.” Wow. What else is there to say? Enough with the debates about which politicians are the best leaders. We're going with Cory Deburghgraeve.#EverydayLeadership.
Everyday Leadership
Advancing a new view of leadership, especially one that emphasizes complexity, introspection and the democratic cultivation of new leaders, is challenging but necessary. In the last few decades, we have come to worship the charismatic leader – strong in crisis, magnetic in personality and passionate of vision. Yet, after years of the born-to-lead culture, today’s public space is sorely lacking leaders who are capable of mastering their organizations and inspiring change, both internally and externally. The 21st century, with its complexity and fragmentation, demands a new type of leader and an improved approach to leadership.
The dominant leadership theories that have guided public discussion and scholarship have fostered generations of leaders in industry and government. They have a solid track record of achievement, and they should not be discarded. Effective leaders do have avisionfor the organization; apassionfor executing that vision; and have established an environment oftransparency and integrityto ensure the organization succeeds. These are great, albeit clichéd, notions that must evolve to meet the needs of today’s organizations.
Leadership isn’t the province of the magnetic personality, and it isn’t solely reserved for the individual at the top of the corporate ladder. It doesn’t depend exclusively on a passionate vision or assume that integrity alone will guarantee effectiveness.
Everyday Leadership, quite simply, is built on the notion that leaders are not born but rather forged in the day-to-day work of organizations and societies; that only by mastering organizational and human complexity can leaders align strategy with organizational and social dynamics; and that leaders must know themselves, alert to their failings and graces, in order to better serve the organization. The anchors of ourEveryday Leadershipframework are organized around four key themes: complexity and alignment, humility, democracy, and introspection.
Complexity and alignment.Everyday Leaders must embrace complexity for the opportunities it holds, both the complexity of the organization and of the human dynamics within the organization. Only by thinking deeply about these intricate patterns and relationships can a leader align organizational form and function, and craft strategies that create new and unexpected avenues for organizational growth and innovation. In the story of Amy, the Hubei citizen living in Shanghai, she faced a complex system and found her way around the barriers that stood in front of her. Leadership in this moment was not about standing at a podium in front of a crowd, it was about knitting together an informal network that would deliver masks to people in need. It wasn’t glamorous, but it was undoubtedly leadership.
Humility and service.Everyday Leaders must have an innate understanding of who they are and be able to define their strengths and weaknesses. While some debate whether acknowledging weakness and apologizing for errors undermines leaders, we contend that by admitting mistakes leaders can gain credibility and trust within the organization. Humility is a powerful tool for personal and institutional growth. In the stories of Amy, the courier, Wang Yong, and, of course, Cory Deburghgraeve, we see a commitment to service. In these cases, leadership is not about the fiery speech of a President, Governor, or Mayor, it is about individuals who step into a void with humility to serve someone in need. It is about giving a stranger a ride, figuring out how to deliver masks, putting yourself at risk to serve others.
Democracy.Individuals at every level of the organization are capable of leadership. In fact, the success of the organization depends on each individual being empowered to lead, because leaders are not born, they mature in the workplace and in civic life. True leaders at the top of an organizational or political hierarchy think first about how to empower people in their organizational life. They make decisions to take care of simple needs. They approve expenses for cans of Coke to overworked employees.
Introspection.Everyday Leaders do not lead by intuition or charisma alone, but instead by having the patience to think analytically about how the parts of their organizations fit together as a whole. They think deeply about their role in their organizations and how best to lead – or to evolve as leaders – based on their profound understanding of themselves and their institutional cultures.
Finally,Everyday Leadershipdemands that individuals be the leaders the organization needs and deserves, whether the CEO or the janitor. This kind of leadership is built and sustained through everyday action because it insists on the full participation of everyone.EverydayLeadership’sgoal isn’t the creation of effective leaders alone, it is the creation of successful organizations and societies that are guided by far-sighted, humble and creative everyday leaders.
This thinking about leadership might seem drab in comparison to flashier manifestos, which are the core of leadership scholarship. What we’re proposing is a simple framework – built on a deep understanding of human behavior and interpersonal relationships – that’s sole purpose is creating effective organizations and in helping societies through crises.
