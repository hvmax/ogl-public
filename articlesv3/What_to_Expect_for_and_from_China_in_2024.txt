### What to Expect for and from China in 2024

On Global Leadership’s regular feature OGL Real Time presents our up-to-the-minute insights on current news and events. We hope these breaking news insights from our OGL team members will help illuminate the events of the day and provide the depth needed to understand global political, economic, and cultural transitions and transformations. In this post, we examine prospects for the year 2024. This Real Time Q&A considers a variety of issues for the coming year, taking into account our own analyses as well as what the OGL team in China hears and sees in local media, social media, and on-the-ground popular sentiment.
China’s economists project 4.6% growth in GDP for the coming year. Many analysts and pundits are worried about this projection, highlighting the missed projection for Q4 2023 and the general concerns over economic fundamentals. What is the OGL view?
In March 2023, when most analysts raised their projections on China’s GDP growth for the year, Beijing proposed an annual growth rate of around 5%, a target generally considered conservative by analysts. The final result was 5.2%. From the result, it looks like analysts were susceptible to the short-term economic data released on a monthly or quarterly basis or, quite simply, to market sentiment. Their ability to judge China’s macroeconomy is not as good as China’s economic authorities, and information asymmetry is a major cause of this misjudgment. For our analysis going forward, we believe that China’s GDP growth target for 2024 will not be less than 5%. Several conditions underpin our belief:
First, from 2011 to 2022, China’s GDP growth rate has been declining. The compound average growth rate in 2022 and 2023 is 4.1%, a figure far below the potential economic growth rate of 6-8% that economists generally agree upon; it also falls short of the requirements for achieving China’s long-term goal of 2035.
Therefore, the Chinese leadership strongly intends to stabilize the Chinese economy by setting a goal not lower than 5%. That being said, there are several levers the government can pull to reach the minimum growth rate it aspires to achieve – and this is true of every nation – and we anticipate that China’s 2024 economic growth will be watched closely by the government and that levers will be gently pulled accordingly.
Second, China ended 2023 with a growth rate of 5.2%, and 2023 was not a year without significant challenges. The first half of 2023 was still reeling from the pandemic, and even with a series of measures introduced in the second half of 2023 to stabilize the negative performance of certain sectors like real estate, the year still ended with an aggregate growth of 5.2%. Thus, we believe that 5% growth seems like a reasonable target, and these goals can be achieved.
Third, so far, 20 provinces (out of 31 provincial administrative units) have announced GDP growth targets, with a minimum of 5%. Thus, we see that this is not simply a Central Government aspirational national projection, but one that matches the rates projected by the 31 provincial administrative units below.
Fourth, 2024 is the year of a U.S. presidential election. China will likely seize the moment to continue to develop its economy in areas including high technology (e.g., chips) and renewable energy initiatives (e.g., electric vehicles) to cope with the impact of a potential Republican presidency.
Beyond what the international and Chinese economic experts say, what is the view of people in China? What are we seeing on social media? What is the sense of the coming year from within?
Judging from personal observations and social media, we believe that the China’s economic vitality is still pointing upward. At the same time, there is obvious uneven and structural differentiation between industries and regions. Here are two examples:
Tourism: Various sources have reported that China’s lack of outbound travel has cost the global economy $129 billion in tourism revenue, and we expect to see that number rebound to some extent. Many analysts believe that the 2024 Spring Festival tourism market is expected to usher in “the hottest outbound travel in five years,” with popular destinations including Southeast Asia (thanks to visa-free travel), Japan, and South Korea. Out-of-season destinations such as Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa, as well as destinations with relatively warm climates like Spain, Greece, and Portugal, have also recovered faster.
In domestic tourism, the number of visitors and tourism revenue in Harbin in North China hit a record high during the New Year’s Day holiday, far exceeding that of the warmer areas in the south like Hainan Island. Shanghai has also attracted many tourists thanks to the popularity of the TV drama Blossoms Shanghai. Many media sources. {Recently, OGL contributed to the CGTN panel discussion on the topic of strategies enacted by local tourism bureaus to attract domestic tourists (here).}
Export: In 2023, China’s exports of goods reached 23.77 trillion yuan, an increase of 0.6% over 2022, but dropped 4.6% to 3.38 trillion in U.S. dollars. The decline was smaller than that of economies such as Russia, South Korea, the ASEAN nations, and Canada, and basically the same as India.
China has promoted trade diversification, and its export structure has changed significantly with technological progress. In 2023, China’s exports to Russia (46.9%) and Africa (7.5%) continued to grow while exports to the United States (-13.1%) and the European Union (-10.2%) recorded double-digit declines. Among them, the share of exports to the United States is the lowest since 1995, and the share of exports to the EU has also hit a new low since 2003. Total exports of electric vehicles, lithium batteries, and photovoltaic power generation products totaled 1.06 trillion yuan, an increase of 29.9%. The export value of ships was close to US$ 27.6 billion, a year-on-year increase of 28.6%.
Enterprises engaged in export will have serious performance differentiation due to different markets and product categories. In 2024, impacted by the restructuring of the global supply chain, trade friction, exchange rate changes, etc, China’s export outlook is full of challenges and uncertainties. As we have noted in previous posts, China’s building of the Belt and Road Initiative is a long-term strategic plan for pivoting away from dependence on Western trading partners, like the United States, however, this strategic plan will take years to reach its full potential.
China’s role in the global political economy has changed dramatically in the last decade, with a growing leadership role in a variety of ways. What can we expect to see in 2024 for U.S.-China engagement, specifically, and China’s role in the global political economy more generally?
In the last year alone, we have seen China’s leadership in the brokering of the Saudi-Iran Peace Deal and its leadership in reorganizing and expanding the BRICS Coalition. We have seen a growing dynamic engagement with the United States, with China visits by Secretaries Blinken, Yellen, and Raimondo. We have witnessed the momentous Summit between Presidents Xi and Biden in San Francisco.
U.S.-China relations in 2024 will be relatively stable, depending on U.S. domestic politics. With regard to relations between Taiwan and the Mainland, to which Beijing attaches the most importance, China will likely respond reciprocally to the actions of the United States. Beijing will seize the time to develop its economy and its own high technology to cope with the impact of a potential Republican presidency. On the Belt and Road Initiative, China will focus more on the cost-effectiveness of new projects. Chinese companies will invest significant effort in exploring the international market because of over-capacity and fierce competition in the domestic market.
What other issues does OGL see on the horizon that might be important for China in 2024?
We expect to see the following issues are going to be important for 2024: New reform measures will be introduced at the Third Plenary Session of the 20th CPC Central Committee. We will be watching intently to see what these reform measures will be and where these measures will drive local governments to focus their attention in the coming year. Industrial development will continue. What kind of progress will China make in high-tech, especially the chip industry?
The difficulties in the real estate market and the domestic stock exchanges have been significant drags and red flags for the economy. Can China’s property sector be stabilized, and will its stock market return as a bull market?
China began its year with the Fifth National Economic Census. The census is conducted every five years, and it comprehensively investigates the development of China’s tertiary and secondary industries. According to the UN Statistics Division, the census scope covers 19 national economic sectors, except agriculture, which are classified into 90 major groups, 378 groups, and 875 small groups. According to the preliminary tabulated results of the economic census, there are more than 5 million legal units, more than 7 million establishments and approximately 40 million self-employed enterprises…”
At OGL, we will be looking closely at the detailed results of the Fifth National Economic Census. This is an important time for China’s economic development in the reform era, and the results of this census will reveal significant insights into where the world’s second-largest economy is headed in 2024 and beyond.
