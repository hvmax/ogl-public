### Debate Watch: Trump Still Doesn't Get How Tariffs Work

11 September 2024|China, Supply Chain, Trade
AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy and, in particular, life in China. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. We have written about economic development in China and China’s economic reforms, U.S.-China relations, China’s changing role in the global political economy, and the history and current state of Chinese politics. In this post, we have a laser focus on former President Trump's discussion of tariffs at the presidential debate on Sept. 10, 2024, with Vice President Kamala Harris. We have written and spoken about these issues previously (see, e.g.,hereandhere) and we continue that conversation in this post.
During the recent presidential debate, GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump defended his proposal for broad tariffs, stating that he would impose a 10% to 20% tariff on all U.S. imports. He emphasized that this would protect American jobs and industries.

Additionally, Trump reiterated his plan for higher tariffs of 60% on imports from China, arguing that these measures would counter what he views as unfair trade practices by China. However, the impact of such tariffs on consumer prices and the economy was a point of contention during the debate.
In the debate, Trump noted that taxpayers are “not gonna have higher prices. Who’s going to have higher prices is China and all the countries that have been ripping us off for years.”
The Tax Foundation, a nonpartisan research group, estimated in June that Trump's proposed new tariffs, if enacted, could hike taxes by another $524 billion annually and shrink U.S. GDP by at least 0.8 percent, the capital stock by 0.7 percent, and result in the loss of 684,000 full-time equivalent jobs.
Perhaps we need a few words about China tariffs again. As this issue continues to dominate the economic policy agenda being put forward by Trump and his running mate J.D. Vance, we feel it is important to take note of the Tax Foundation's analysis and stake out our position as clearly as possible and then relate it back to the real world.
With the tariffs levied on imported goods, multinational corporations, motivated by profits and shareholder value will, almost without exception, pass this cost on to the consumer -- no matter what the former president claims. Tariffs are not a tax on a foreign country, like China; they are a tax on goods that come from that country, and corporations almost always pass that cost on to consumers in the form of higher prices.
Trump’s take on this is absolutely false, and has been proven wrong by economic analyses over the last forty years. We believe his motivation for repeating this notion falls into one of two camps: (1) Trump and Vance simply don’t understand what a tariff is or what it does or what trade means; or (2) they cynically believe that the American people don’t understand the economics of these instruments and that voters can be snowed by talk without facts.
For what it’s worth, we don’t actually believe Trump doesn’t understand how tariffs work. We are more inclined to the cynical explanation that people will believe what they are told by a charismatic leader who is willing to shade the truth to tell a story. We do find it especially odd that Trump made the same pitch to a room full of business leaders at the Economic Club of New York recently. These people understand trade and tariffs.
Theoretically, if the tariff significantly increases the price of the goods, corporations could be incentivized to produce the goods elsewhere, perhaps even in the United States. However, in today’s world of global capitalism and supply chains, this almost never happens. Corporations become so deeply embedded with the networks of suppliers in their global supply chains that it rarely makes sense to try to quickly change their locale of production.
China tariffs affect companies very differently. For example, consumer tech powerhouse Apple fares the worst in the Trump-Vance economic model. The vast majority of Apple products are produced in China, where Apple has relationships with more than 1,500 suppliers. According to a study conducted by Sirui Zhu and Ally Levine in 2019, 92% of Apple products were affected by the 25% tariffs set in place by then President Trump. And these costs were always passed on to consumers.
The circumstances of say a Tesla and a General Motors are different than Apple’s with respect to tariffs. Tesla is largely unaffected by Trump’s sweeping tariffs, as all of the company’s China-made vehicles are sold outside of the United States, mostly in Europe. And, for Tesla EVs sold in the United States, all of them are built in the gigafactories in California, Nevada, New York, and Texas.
GM has a much smaller footprint in the EV space, but all of its EVs are produced in Michigan, Tennessee, Kansas, and Ohio. However, in the case of GM, U.S. consumers are exposed to Trump-Vance tariffs, as Chinese-made vehicles, including Chevrolet, Buick, and Cadillac, are produced in China and exported to the United States.
The Biden Administration did extend the Section 301 tariffs imposed by Trump, and increased tariffs on certain China-made goods such as EV batteries, some types of semiconductors, and solar panels. Interestingly, the $18 billion in tariffs targeted at the EV industry seem much more likely to do what tariffs are meant to do – add expense to specific imported goods that would push consumers to purchase U.S.-produced goods and thereby support or create American jobs.
In contrast, Trump's sweeping $300 billion tariffs model, which encompasses virtually all goods imported from China to the United States, translated into increased prices for China-made products for consumers on a variety of products.
It's possible that someone inside the Biden Administration understood that targeted tariffs can actually raise the price of goods in specific areas that can incentivize consumers to buy manufactured-in-America goods, thus supporting and perhaps creating jobs in America.
If we are going to deploy tariffs in support of U.S. industry, this approach reflects what tariffs are supposed to do. Blanket tariffs are doing nothing but hurting workings and shrinking the U.S. economy.
