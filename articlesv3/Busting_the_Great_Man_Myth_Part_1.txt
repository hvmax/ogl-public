This is the second entry in a multi-partOn Global Leadershipseries on Systems Leadership. Inthe opening post, we contrasted conventional linear thinking with non-linear systems-driven thinking. To illustrate, we offered two views of a social media enterprise and described how the systems-driven perspective provided leaders with a more robust understanding of the multiple and interdependent elements in a complex system. This post, we explore another critical contrast that marks systems thinking – that between individual and collective leadership. To do so, we begin an examination of the “Great Man Myth” that persists in much of the contemporary study of leadership thinking and action.
By Sara Beckman and David Slocum
The study of leadership has traditionally focused on individual leaders. From its roots in the historical and literary accounts of military and political strategy, efforts across millennia to explain successful (and, occasionally, failed) leaders turned on describing their defining traits, behaviors, or backgrounds. Leaders, by turns, were exceptional, heroic, larger-than-life, often defined by their world-changing impact, and typically male.
Gradually, by the second half of the twentieth century, scholars and other commentators increased their attention to the import of situations in which leaders acted and the often-transformational relationships they had with their followers. More recently, management practitioners and researchers have developed more varied approaches that move beyond person-centered perspectives to emphasizecomplexity,adaptive, andsystemsleadership. Yet even amidst this thoughtful attempt to re-frame leadership as a more collective and interdependent activity, theromanceor “Great Man Myth” of individual leaders still persists.
Former U.S. Army general Stanley McChrystal offers a striking example in his 2018 book,Leaders: Myth and Reality. After dwelling on thirteen extended portraits of historical figures spanning hundreds of pages, McChrystal acknowledges that he himself succumbed to the mythology of individual leaders, and he issues a call for an understanding of leadership that is more systems-based. He and his co-authors conclude with a sharp contrast between the “myth” and the “reality” of leadership. They describe the myth, captured inFigure 1, as an age-old distortion that involves a top-down process, initiated by individual leaders who apply whatever necessary leadership “force” they deem is required to influence both situational factors (context) and followers in order to produce particular results.
How leadership works in reality, however, is an “emergent property of the interactions” among leaders, context, and followers. While it resembles other approaches to leadership based on interactions among leaders, followers, and situational elements (e.g.,Hughes, Ginnett and Curphy’s interactional framework), McChrystal diminishes the role of individual leaders. Instead, he increases the importance of a larger “dynamic system” of constantly shifting variables. The result is a more holistic definition: “Leadership is a complex system of relationships between leaders and followers, in a particular context, that provides meaning to its members," according to McChrystal. (Figure 2).
That formulation offers a powerful shift in emphasis from the individual leader to the collective leadership of multiple leaders, followers, and context. Importantly, McChrystal retains a telling individual element in his explanation of how leadershipreally works:the relationships and interactions between leaders and followers or situational factors remain driven, in part, by “symbolism, identity, purpose, future potential, etc.” That is, by more than just formal considerations, activities, and results. Rather than completely leaving behind the myth of the individual, he offers a revision or, perhaps better, a transformation of the driving “force” of leaders to include the symbolic force of leadership. What we accordingly might call theLeader-Symbolboth overlaps with and extends beyond actual individual or group leaders.
Among business leaders today, when innovative and entrepreneurial abilities are commonly associated with effective leadership, this symbolism can produce tangible value. For example, individual leadership can create what some call an “innovation premium.” The very presence of Steve Jobs at Apple following his return to the company as CEO in 1997 is estimated to haveincreased the company’s market value by as much as 52%. Similarly, some contend that the basis ofTesla’s market capitalizationis less its performance in the marketplace or financial results than the promise of continuing visionary innovation driven by Elon Musk. Leadership in these cases still depends on the myth of outsized and singular individuals. That leadership, moreover, has relied on both relationships with formal followers―Apple or Tesla employees, suppliers, vendors, and other organizational partners―and on Jobs or Musk as symbols of future potential in the markets and with the wider public. In other words, explanations for success redound to the individual leader and what management scholars Nathan Furr and Hal Gregersen call the “innovation capital” that leader brings to given situations.
To raise factors like leadership reputation and future potential requires a clear definition of the other defining terms. As already observed,Leaderstoday often involve groups of collaborators, like top teams and other models of collective leadership. They interact regularly with a host ofOthers, like followers and other colleagues within teams and firms, but also including external stakeholders, investors, and market analysts. Those relationships occur amidst differentContextsthat bring together varying salient conditions, variables, and other factors. These might include team or organizational processes and cultures, firm and industry financial conditions, and user relationships and brand considerations. The leaders’ relationships with others and interactions with dynamic situations together give shape to the leadership system. The other crucial element here is the emergent and socially constructed force, that is, theLeader-Symbolthat can serve leaders, teams, and firms inside and outside organizations.
Jobs’ return to Apple in the late 1990s provides a helpful illustration. As biographerWalter Isaacsonwrites, he believed the company’s “great advantage was its integration” and the ability of all departments “to work together in parallel.” Jobs was a technology and marketing visionary, and that contributed to his being theLeader-Symbolof Apple, both internally and externally among investors and in the marketplace. Yet the circle of departmental leaders around him, the team ofOthers, was critical to the company’s success. These included Chief Operations Officer and supply chain guru Tim Cook, design lead Jony Ive, marketing head Phil Schiller, and Chief Financial Officer Peter Oppenheimer. That team arguably managed many of the changing business and marketSituationsthat required ongoing adaptive leadership better than Jobs would have if he attempted to micromanage across those many functions. The resultingLeadership Systemmay thus have most visibly included the vaunted focus and autocratic nature associated with Jobs himself but it also needed the less visible and everyday work of others in managing the dynamic conditions in which the company operated (Figure 3).
Each of these re-definitions expands the description of theRealityof more collective leadership offered by McChrystal. Yet at least two critical differences deserve a mention. The first difference is that the center of the relationships and interactions amongLeaders, Other Persons, andContextare a dynamic set ofActivities and Results. While leadership is an essential part, even the source of connection and propulsion, theraison d’êtreof these agents and forces joining together is action and change. A second difference builds on the interdependence rather than independence of these elements, which we can view as connected systems. TheContextual Systemthus incorporates salient situational variables, leaders, and others, as well as ongoingActivities and Results. Importantly, this system includes elements outside the team or company itself, from suppliers, users, and competitors to legal regulations and commercial financing rates. TheLeadership Systemcomprises individual and group leaders and theLeader-Symboland engages (but does not subsume) others and relevant contexts.
Despite the logic and evidence of the reality of collective leadership, the myth of charismatic individual leaders has stubborn psychological and cultural roots. Psychologist Daniel Kahneman has said, “People prefer leaders who are intuitive and who are over-confident. Leaders who deliberate too much are viewed with suspicion.” Similarly, many people can be wary of leaders who delegate too much, who share their leadership with others, who are shaped by external conditions and situations, and who are humble and combine their confidence with competence. One of the practical consequences of this bias is the added challenge it presents for many women leaders. In his aptly titled book,Why So Many Incompetent Men Become Leaders? (And How To Fix It), University College London business psychologist Tomas Chamorro-Premuzic directly addresses the basis for the confidence gap experienced by many women leaders. Rather than confidence, charisma, and individual success, he presents the evidence-based view of good leadership comprising competence, integrity, and building and enabling a winning team.
Popular culture also perpetuates the myth of individual leaders. Filmmaker Alfred Hitchcock once said, a movie or drama is “life with the dull bits cut out.” That kind of simplification works in several ways. A clear-cut narrative drive and drama streamlines our perceptions of leadership. The longstanding emphasis on a strong individual protagonist in a leadership narrative prioritizes a single leader, working in hierarchies, and taking dramatic actions to resolve neatly-defined situations. Cutting out “the dull bits” can translate into expectations that leaders’ lives or careers should be extraordinary – that is, in some way, not ordinary, messy, or complicated. Perhaps they have special vision or expertise, exceptional grit or resolve, an intense curiosity or work ethic, a profound commitment to product excellence, other persons, or the social good. This reliance on distinctive personal traits, motivations, or exceptional behaviors to mark them connects leaders to a wider conception of heroism reinforced by popular and other cultural representations. Today, many still look to a leader whom they believe is enough unlike them, at least in ways relevant to a shared collective enterprise, to trust and follow.
Within that prevailing storytelling tradition of heroic individualism and linear narrative, few women leaders have appeared. The scarcity, of course, is part of a wider pattern of under-representation and misrepresentation of women on screens. When female leaders are featured, particularly outside action movies, they tend to be cast in historical “Great Woman” roles (Helen Mirren’s Elizabeth II inThe Queen[2006], Meryl Streep’s Margaret Thatcher inThe Iron Lady[2011],Audrey Tautou as Coco Chanel inCoco Before Chanel[2009], Taraji P. Henson’s Katherine Johnson inHidden Figures[2016]). Likewise, in films specifically about women entrepreneurs or business leaders, the protagonists are, like their male counterparts, typically individualistic and heroic disruptors often cast into leadership by circumstance (Sally Field’s Norma Rae Webster inNorma Rae[1979], Julia Roberts asErin Brockovich[2000], and Jennifer Lawrence’s Joy Mangano inJoy[2015]). To speak of a “Great Man” myth is to highlight longstanding ways of seeing particular types of individual leaders, even when they occasionally happen to be female, and telling consistent stories about how they take action, influence others, and effect change in the world.
The “Great Man Myth” of leadership retains its power and impact because it is reinforced in popular culture and in the reality of business, politics, or other forms of organizational life. As a result, the myth impairs our understanding of the reality of particular leadership situations and impedes our ability to learn and develop our own leadership. Just as the introductory piece in this series on systems leadership juxtaposed non-linear and linear thinking, a key takeaway here is that leadership today can be better understood and practiced as a collective rather than an individual activity. The pathbreaking researcher of teams, J. Richard Hackman, once extended what psychologists refer to as the “fundamental attribution error,” in which humans attribute too much credit, blame, or responsibility to individuals rather than situational factors, leaders in teams and other collective enterprises. We would do well to address and avoid this all-too-commonleader attribution error, with its attendant cultural and gendered freight, and focus instead on the reality of shared leadership.
The next piece in the series will deepen our examination of the “Great Man Myth” and begin building an alternative perspective,The Systems Leader, that explores how individuals participate and thrive in collective leadership.
