### Growing Cities: Urbanization of China

13 May 2021|China, Economic Development
AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy and, in particular, life in China. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. We have sought to advance a conversation about the U.S.-China relationship, and a deep understanding of local economic development in China. We have been writing about the U.S.-China Trade War as it relates toinnovation in the Chinese economy;entrepreneurship in China today;anda series aboutChina’s Belt and Road Initiative. More recently, we have focused on thestrategic strength oflocal economic development in China’s 2nd and 3rd tier cities. This post adds to that conversation. – The Editorial Team

When China entered the era of economic reform in 1979, 80% of the population lived in rural areas, with about 800 million people living in abject poverty (World Bank poverty standards). Since the beginning of the economic reforms, urbanization has been a central part of China’s path toward a modern economy and society. The development of cities and urbanization are the results of and reasons for China's rapid growth over the past 40 years. China has entered a new normal of economic development, shifting from the pursuit of high-speed growth through export-led and investment-led growth to the pursuit of higher efficiency and quality in its economy.
What will be the growth engine of China's economy in the next 15 years? We believe that urbanization will continue to provide the most significant development momentum and a driving force of domestic demand. To understand the future of the world’s second largest economy, we need to examine cities and urbanization in China today. And not just the famous megacities that are so well-known around the world. We will examine the dynamics of growth in 2nd, 3rd, and 4th Tier cities, which are fast becoming the engine of economic growth in China today.
On March 11, Chinese lawmakers approved “The 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-2025) and the Long-Range Objectives through the Year 2035”, which is described as the country's development blueprint. In combination with the 14th Five-Year Plan (FYP), we will introduce some key concepts and perspectives to understand cities and urbanization of China.
City Classification
With a 60.6% urbanization rate as of 2020, the FYP sets a goal of 65% for 2025, estimating that in the next five years some 61 million agricultural workers will shift from rural to urban lives. The key in this transformation is a necessary reform of the household registration system, which separates urban and rural areas. In the FYP, this transformation is grounded in how a city is classified and based on the number of residents living in the urban area of a city (urban residents), under the standards released by the State Council in 2014. For example, the restrictions on settlement in cities with urban residents of less than 3 million will be completely removed, a major change in the control over the flow of migrant populations in China.
A critical distinction.In China, the city is first and foremost an administrative unit. Many cities have large rural areas or suburbs under their jurisdiction, some stretching for miles and miles across large swaths of land and with significant populations. The City of Shanghai, for example, a city of 24 million residents, is comprised of six urban districts and nine suburban districts. It covers 6,341 square kilometers. By comparison, the City of New York, with a population of about 8.3 million, covers about 1,200 square kilometers of land. As we have written previously, there is an important dynamic between the direction set by the Central Government and the empowerment of local municipalities for innovatively following an economic development path.
In the State Council standard, people living in towns in the suburbs of a city are considered township residents, not urban residents. Thus, this definition is closer to the concept of the city in developed nations. However, there are a number of different classifications for China’s cities today. The administrative hierarchy of cities is another Chinese character: The highest level of a city is a provincial-level municipality, then a sub-provincial city and a prefecture-level city, the lowest is a county-level city. The establishment of a city, its size, and authority must be approved by the State Council in Beijing.
Beyond the above city classification standards, nine cities have been approved for the National Central City (NCC) classification. In 2010, Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Guangzhou, and Chongqing became the first batch of NCC cities (1), followed by Chengdu (2016), Wuhan (2017), Zhengzhou (2017), and Xi'an (2018). First released in 2005, NCCs are metropolises endowed with leading and performing tasks in politics, economics, and cultural areas. It’s worth noting that some other cities with larger populations and economic scale have not been identified as NCCs. Practically speaking, the Central Government provides cities with guidance rather than centralized command and control. However, NCCs also need to stand out in a relatively market-oriented race between cities.
Some financial media and research institutions believe that administrative level and GDP do not properly reflect a city’s commercial and economic growth potential, so they have launched their own city rankings, e.g., Yicai’s "China City Commercial Charm Ranking." The number of Starbucks stores is often used to measure the business and vitality of a city, which is called the Starbucks Index. Other indicators include the number of Pizza Hut stores and the mileage of rail transit operating in the city.
City Clusters and Metropolitan Areas
The 14th FYP advocates the integrated development of the city cluster and the construction of a modern metropolitan area as the major task of urbanization from 2021 to 2025. China's urbanization will be driven by the development of the city clusters until 2035. The 19+2 city cluster raised in the 13th FYP is fully retained in the 14th FYP. From the position of each city cluster described in the 14th FYP, the Chengdu-Chongqing city cluster in West China and the Middle-Reaches Yangtze city cluster in Central China have entered the first echelon, a sign that the gap between the East and the West has narrowed. However, the gap between the North and the South has grown wider.
See Figure 4, a detailed profile of different ways of city ranking, compiled by Xanadu.Review the chart here.
Ever since the 11th FYP (2006), China has formulated a series of city cluster development plans. The intention of developing a city cluster is to break the political and regional boundaries between cities, and realize coordinated development according to respective endowments. Yet, achieving coordinated development across different administrative regions is always challenging in China. While neighboring cities usually have the willingness to cooperate, there are also intractable conflicts of interest and fierce competition. With the exception of a few successes like the Yangtze River Delta and the Pearl River Delta, the effects of most plans are not obvious.
As a solution, the 14th FYP puts forward a plan to develop metropolitan area inside a city cluster. A modern metropolitan area should have the following characteristics:
1. A central city in a leading role
2. A high degree of co-urbanization
3. 1-hour commuter circle, often formed by convenient rail transit system
4. Mutually recognized and shared public services.
Guangzhou and Foshan in the Pearl River Delta region are leaders in China's regional integration. They have proposed radical integration plans including a tax-sharing mechanism (2). Officials and people in the surrounding developing areas usually have a strong willingness to integrate with a developed central city. At present, people are prevented by restrictions to obtain household registration in megacities and supercities that possess abundant public resources. The development of the metropolitan area allows residents in the adjacent regions of a central city to enjoy equivalent public services, a good strategy to expand the capacity and benefits of a central city without breaking the existing urban management system.
Rail public transportation is the first choice of commuting inside a metropolitan area. From Tianjin to Beijing, although it takes about 30 minutes one-way by high-speed intercity railway, the daily commuting cost is over ￥100 and it is beyond most people’s budget. Inside the Shanghai metropolitan area, through Metro Line 11, it takes 70 minutes for a distance of 45 kilometer from Huaqiao, Jiangsu Province to Xujiahui in downtown Shanghai, where many foreign companies reside. The Metro ticket price is ￥7 one way and the train runs every 5 minutes during peak hours. As a reference, the second-hand apartment price in the area 35 minutes away from Xujiahui by Line 11 is around $7,700/m2, and the average price in Huaqiao is around $3100 yuan/ m2. During the 14th FYP period, Shanghai will be developing five new cities, which are about 30 kilometers from the city center. If the plan is successful, these new cities will create more jobs that will attract people living further outside Shanghai. Coupled with public transportation, the commuting distance of Shanghai’s metropolitan area can be expanded by 30 kilometers and that doubles the current one-hour commuting area.
As shown in Figure 1, the jurisdiction area of China's big cities is already quite large and a city itself can be a metropolitan area of its own. Some metropolitan area plans are too aggressive, such as “The Plan for the Nanjing Metropolitan Area”, which was released in March 2021. The plan covers nine prefecture-level cities in Jiangsu and Anhui provinces, resulting in a total area of 66,000 square kilometers and a population of 35,459,600 (Year-end of 2019). The plan actually aims to build the Nanjing city cluster, as opposed to simply building up the Nanjing City Area. We are not optimistic about the Nanjing metropolitan area because the larger the scope of a plan, the more investment is required, and the more difficult it is to implement.
The New Urbanization
China has experienced the largest urbanization process in the world’s history. Its urban resident population has increased from 213 million in 1982 to 848 million in 2019, and the urbanization rate has increased from 20.6% to 60.6% (2). It is foreseeable that from now until 2035, China's urbanization will continue to move forward. To help our readers understand how the goals in FYP will be realized, we have translated six major new urbanization construction projects listed in the 14th FYP.
After diving into the Chinese cities and urbanization with the 14th FYP, our takeaways are the following:
China will not only have megacities like Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen, more successful cities will likely arise in the future.Competition between cities will continue to be the decisive factor in urbanization. A city development plan can only be realized through competition, and the winner will be identified through the race.In the city race, the southeast coastal region will maintain its advantages, the central and western regions are narrowing the gap with new leaders, and the northern regions are falling behind.To evaluate a city, one should not only look at the absolute numbers, but also per capita data and the meaning behind the numbers.The FYP is a unique governance methodology derived from China's history and background. It is not necessary for other countries to become China in order to compete with China.
