On Global Leadership helps to illuminate the events of the day in China and provide the depth needed to understand global political, economic and cultural transitions and transformations (see, for example,here,here, andhere). With this story, OGL returns to China’s 5th China International Import Expo (CIIE) in this post-COVID era to cull on-the-ground insights about China's  automobile industry.
Reflections from the Automobile Hall at the 5th China International Import Expo (CIIE)
The Fifth China International Import Expo (CIIE), the country's first major international trade exhibition since the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, was held in a particularly fraught environment: the world economy is slowing; US-China relations are worrisome, and a "Decoupling from China" seems imminent; and China's COVID-19 control measures remain controversial, and have prevented people from traveling.
Despite the travel restrictions, the number of participating countries and enterprises was similar to last year, with more than 2,800 exhibitors from 127 countries and regions in Shanghai. CIIE reported that a total of $73.52 billion worth of tentative deals were reached for one-year purchases of goods and services in the expo, up 3.9 percent from last year.
China is the largest automotive manufacturing country and automotive market in the world, as 30% of the world's car sales are in China today. In 2021, about one out of every five new cars in China bears the logo of a German brand, and Japanese manufacturers sold around 4.4 million cars here. Taking into account a growing middle class, increasing demand for mobility, and low car ownership rates, China still has great potential for further growth.
Like the past four expos, the Automobile Hall remains the most popular exhibition area. If the 2022 Beijing Auto Show and Guangzhou Auto Show cannot be held as scheduled because of COVID-19, the CIIE may be the last showcase for automakers in China in 2022. What have global automakers brought to this public stage and China, and what does it mean? During my walk through the exhibits, I found several key themes: electrification, hydrogen and smart mobility; personalization and luxury; and localization.
Electrification, hydrogen and smart mobility."New energy" has been a watchword at the Automobile Hall; about 90% of the displayed vehicles are new energy vehicles. U.S. and German automakers focused on electrified models, while their Korean and Japanese peers focused on both electrified and hydrogen fuel cell models. With numerous cutting-edge technologies launched by many automakers, smart mobility is becoming more and more promising. The ubiquitous "e" and "i" in the exhibition hall reflect that cars are becoming "networked computers on wheels".  As those future mobility concepts  become real, smart and green mobility is shaping the entire auto industry.
Luxury and personalization.CIIE visitors represent the expanding Chinese middle to high-income consumers, the ideal target customer base for automakers to establish their brand image.  Automobiles are a popular consumer good, in part, because automakers offer luxury brands and personalized models. Although large SUVs and pickup trucks are quite niche in China, they are the core exhibits at the booths of General Motors and Ford.
Porsche at the Volkswagen booth and Maybach at the Mercedes-Benz booth have also received a lot of attention. Contrary to the high-profile appearance of European and American luxury car brands, people have also noticed the absence of that of Toyota, Honda and Nissan, leaving GENESIS of Hyundai the only high-end brand on the show.
Localization.When multinational automobile giants like Volkswagen and Honda showcase their latest technical developments, they highlight the "China origin" of their achievements. Volkswagen presented "Neon", a new vehicle lighting control system developed by the China team of its software division CARIAD. In April 2022, CARIAD officially established a subsidiary in China -- its first subsidiary outside Europe. Honda had the world premiere of its new concept car, the e:N2Concept, developed and built by a young team at Honda China. Toyota and Tsinghua University established a joint research institute. Working together to cope with China's aging society, its latest research resulted in "Mobile Hospital", which was unveiled for the first time at the CIIE.
China's automotive industry has established a complete industrial system, supply chain and talent reserve, and it has become a major player in new energy vehicles. The ability to build value chain for the Chinese market has become a differentiate factor among automakers in China.
From the 5th CIIE, we can see that multinational automakers have shown their determination and commitment to this market.
They have made a 180-degree turn to embrace new energy vehicles, and to compete more effectively against China's new auto-making forces represented by BYD and NIO.
At CIIE, multinational automakers have presented their unique market positioning and forecasts for the future of the industry. Although each company has its own understanding of China today and its auto market, as well as a strategy to benefit from CIIE, the most important factor is participation for multinational automakers and for China.
