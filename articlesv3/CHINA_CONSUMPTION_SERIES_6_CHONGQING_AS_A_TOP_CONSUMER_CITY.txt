### CHINA CONSUMPTION SERIES 6: CHONGQING AS A TOP CONSUMER CITY (?)

25 September 2025|China's Transforming Economy
AtOn Global Leadership, we have developed a deep analysis of the Chinese economy and the Chinese economic transformation over the last 45 years. We have written about China’s innovative approach to building the most dynamic manufacturing supply chain in the world and China’s approach to building the world’s most dynamic capitalist economy. We have advanced this analysis through our work on China’ssecond- andthird-tier city development of innovative,entrepreneurial citiesandlocal industrial clusters. We have also used the field ofNew Economy Sociology(with leaders likeNeil Fligstein,Walter Powell, andHarrison White) and theNew Structural Economics(Justin Lin,林毅夫) and the field of Sociology (with scholars like Andrew Walder and Thomas Gold). In our OGL approach to research, we focus in on very specific cities, local political economies, and topics. In this post, we follow up on a meeting with one of the world’s leading economists, Professor Justin Lin. In that meeting Professor Lin, asked OGL to lay out our analysis of what was happening in China’s Consumption Economy development. This article is the sixth in a series of OGL analyses on this topic. In this post, we look at the case of China’s megacity, Chongqing. We ask the question, “Is Chongqing China’s top consumption city?” We draw out comparisons with another Chinese megacity, Shanghai, and we look at the stages of economic development in different areas.

Consumption is a significant issue in analyses of China’s economic development today. Many economists assert that low consumption is one of the looming and growing problems for China’s economy. Issues often raised, are the Real Estate “crisis” (a term used too often, in our view), low consumer confidence, low consumer spending, and higher than average household savings rates. It is the OGL view that the handwringing and apocalyptic discussions about China’s consumer economy arevastlyoverstated. We have posted several articles in this series to use case studies to “go deep” on the economic analysis of the consumer economy (this is the 6th article in that series). And we will post at least one more article that uses the OGL theoretical framework to analyze how China compares to the rest of the world and how we should employ more advanced economic frameworks to analyze consumer economies. In this article, we continue our “going-deep, boots-on-the-ground, case-study" approach to studying important economic and political issues, in this case, China’s consumer economy. Here we focus on the case of China’s most populous city, Chongqing.
Is Chongqing China’s Top Consumption City?
China’s consumption landscape is undergoing a profound transformation. In the first half of 2025, Chongqing ranked first among Chinese cities in Total Retail Sales of Consumer Goods (TRSCG), reaching 830 billion yuan – surprisingly overtaking Shanghai’s longstanding leadership position in this space. This milestone signifies a historic shift, ending the long-standing dominance of Shanghai and Beijing as the country’s top two consumer markets.
Known as the “8D magic city,” Chongqing has evolved from a “cyberpunk” municipality into a leading consumption hub, prompting debate over whether it merits the title of “China’s top consumption city.” Chongqing is China’s most populous city, and joined Shanghai, Beijing, and Tianjin as a provincial-level municipality in 1997. It is an inland city in Southwest China and has, for years, been viewed as a “hinterland,” an inland city that was the hub of China’s inland provinces and a link to the middle Asian presences. However, Chongqing has recently been viewed as a “hot” “cyberpunk” space, a place where young, creative entrepreneurs and tourists want to be. Beyond the headline figures lie a broader trend: the rise of inland cities and the reshaping of China’s consumption geography. But does higher TRSCG necessarily reflect stronger consumption power? Amid growing discussions that ‘even first-tier cities are facing tough times,’ a more critical question arises: how should we accurately assess a city’s true consumption vitality? This issue is especially important now, as many economists are questioning China’s growth potential in based on the gradual growth of its consumption economy. So, let’s unpack this issue, specifically focusing on the case of China’s most populous city, Chongqing.
Total Retail Sales of Consumer Goods (TRSCG) refers to the revenue received by enterprises through direct sales of non-production and non-business physical commodities to individuals and social institutions (1), and revenue from providing catering services. It is one of the core indicators used to measure the scale of China’s consumption market. When making international comparisons, the closest equivalent to China’s TRSCG is Retail Sales in the United States, although the latter covers only merchandise retail and excludes catering services.
Chongqing vs. Shanghai
In the category of TRSCG, Chongqing dramatically surpassed Shanghai to rank first nationwide is the result of multiple factors, primarily including the following four aspects.
A.Differences in Population Size and Development Stages
Chongqing has a permanent resident population of over 32 million – roughly 1.3 times that of Shanghai – providing a solid foundation for its consumer market. While Shanghai has entered a post-industrial stage, Chongqing is still undergoing rapid urbanization, fueling sustained demand for major physical goods such as automobiles and home appliances. In recent years, consumption-stimulus policies (e.g., subsidies for new-energy vehicles and appliance trade-in programs) have demonstrated notable effectiveness in Chongqing, where lower-tier markets offer significant untapped potential.
In contrast, Shanghai’s consumption structure is highly service-oriented, with accumulated service-related expenditure equals nearly 60% of its TRSCG (2). As a result, the growth potential for goods consumption is more limited, meaning TRSCG figures alone don’t fully capture Shanghai’s overall consumption strength.
B.Data Revisions Due to Statistical Recalibration
The Fifth National Economic Census conducted in 2023 systematically recalibrated historical data, producing divergent effects on Chongqing and Shanghai. Given the high diversity of business entities in Chongqing, the census likely captured a substantial number of previously undercounted small and micro enterprises as well as self-employed businesses, leading to an upward revision of its total TRSCG.
Shanghai’s statistical framework was already relatively mature, so the census focused on refining measurement criteria by excluding non-final consumption transactions – such as bulk commodity wholesale and cross-regional transshipment sales – from TRSCG calculations. This dual adjustment – growth in Chongqing’s revised figures and contraction in Shanghai’s – resulted in Chongqing’s adjusted 2024 TRSCG surpassing that of Shanghai.
C.Cumulative Impacts of Urban-Rural Structures and Statistical Methodological Approaches
Chongqing’s urbanization rate by the end of 2024 (72.1%) is significantly lower than Shanghai’s (89.5%), with nearly 9 million rural residents. In its rural areas, certain productive consumption – such as agricultural inputs and construction materials – may be included in TRSCG, though not typical items of household final consumption. By contrast, such expenditures are negligible in Shanghai, resulting in a TRSCG figure that more accurately reflects actual household consumption levels.
D.Variations in Consumption Patterns and Spillover Effects
Unlike Chongqing, where consumption is predominantly local, Shanghai – a high-income, highly open metropolis – has seen its residents’ consumption patterns extend beyond geographical boundaries. Many residents leverage high-speed rail and air networks to engage in shopping, tourism, and leisure across the Yangtze River Delta and even in overseas destinations like Japan and South Korea. This “consumption spillover” diverts spending that could otherwise occur locally, resulting in a TRSCG figure that under-represents the true consumption capacity of Shanghai’s residents.
TRSCG Is Important but Not that Important
China’s consumption structure is shifting from a goods-led model toward a more balanced “goods + services” framework. However, TRSCG primarily captures retail sales of physical goods, making it inadequate for reflecting the full scope of consumption activity. Therefore, interpreting Chongqing’s top TRSCG ranking as evidence that “first-tier cities are facing tough times” not only misreads the statistics but also overlooks the pivotal role these cities play as drivers of consumption upgrading. The true vitality of first-tier cities is better reflected in higher per capita consumption, stronger influence in trends, and greater capacity to generate regional consumption spillovers.
Indeed, amid macroeconomic transformations and escalating geopolitical tensions – such as the U.S.-China trade conflict and the downturn in the real estate market – all cities are confronting significant challenges, with consumers in first-tier cities exhibiting heightened sensitivity to these pressures. Nevertheless, when evaluated across multiple dimensions, first-tier cities continue to serve as China’s primary consumption powerhouses, underpinned by their robust economic foundations.
Chongqing’s rise to the top in TRSCG is undoubtedly a positive signal, clearly demonstrating that China’s consumption vitality is expanding from the eastern regions and first-tier cities to central and western areas, as well as lower-tier cities – accelerating the emergence of a more multi-polar consumption landscape.
It must be emphasized, however, that TRSCG primarily measures retail sales of goods and, as a single metric, is insufficient for capturing the full scope of consumption, particularly given the growing significance of the services sector. A unified consumption statistic that encompasses both goods and services is needed to more accurately assess national consumption levels. Only then will debates over China’s “top consumption city” become truly meaningful.
