### "All Quiet on the Western Front" & Everyday Leadership

24 February 2023|Creative Leadership, Culture, Everyday Leadership, Leadership
We continue our series of pieces asking what we can learn about leadership from the Oscar-nominated Best Picture films announced by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Like most of you, we are moved by the culture around us, and often we learn from that culture. We decided to take a look at the 10 nominated films and see what insights about leadership we can glean from the characters, themes, or locations. Our next contribution in this series is about the remarkable "All Quiet on the Western Front.”
"All Quiet on the Western Front": Everyday Leadership in Action
Leadership is often a secondary theme in war movies. It is showcased in generals as much as privates, revealing leaders at work in war rooms and foxholes. In the Oscar-nominated “All Quiet on the Western Front,” the filmmaker's focus on the futility of World War I, and all wars, but also on the ineffectiveness of traditional views of leadership.

The story centers around four young men, all friends at school, who enlist together to join the fighting. We watch them almost instantly encounter the worst possible violence and degradation imaginable. Their youthful faces grow murky with dirt and mud as their souls are weakened by the dismemberment and death around them.
Most of the film takes place on Germany's western front -- an imaginary line that ran from the North Sea through Belgium and France -- in the closing months of the war. It  introduces us to the political divisions among German civilian leaders (weary and ready for peace) and some the German generals (narcissistic and defiant) over the impending surrender, which will end the three-plus years of trench warfare along the line where the sides often battled for months over a few hundred yards.

While our "hero", if there is one, is Paul Bäumer (Felix Kammerer), an empathetic and sensitive young man, our everyday leader in the group is the weary soldier, 40-year-old Stanislaus Katczinsky (Albrecht Schuch), or Kat. He becomes the informal leader of the band of younger soldiers because of his age, in part, but most because of his uncanny knack for finding food, clothing, and blankets for his charges.
Kat becomes the troop's informal leader. He has a sixth sense for figuring out when bad things are about to happen and for keeping their spirits buoyed with a joke or a story. He is an old front-hog, who has survived the bombs, the mustard gas, and the boredom of trench life. He also has a simple bravery in getting the job done, one that is admired by his young followers.
Bravery is a key element of the Everyday Leadership principles  we discuss so often here at OGL. We believe leaders are forged in the day-to-day work of life and organizations--and wars. The anchors of our framework are organized around five key pillars: complexity and alignment, humility and courage, democracy, introspection and creativity.
We believe leaders can only know themselves by mastering  human complexity. Alert to their own failings and graces, they can better serve their people. Kat daily earns his fellow soldiers' respect for his knowledge of the ever-so-dangerous trenches, but, more importantly, for his understanding of human nature. Through the pervasive fear and confusion around them, Kat inspires his charges to another day.
That these days occur in one of the worst wars known to humanity is more than tragic, but then that was the point of the original book by Eric Maria Remarque. The author wrote about the ugly, unforgiving nature of a war he had served in and survived. If his characters don't fare as well, despite their friendship with the resourceful Kat, that brings a level of heartbreaking reality to the film and the book.
