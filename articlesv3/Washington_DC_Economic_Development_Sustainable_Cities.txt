### Washington, DC: Economic Development & Sustainable Cities

(This column was originally published on Forbes.com. It has been updated to reflect additional thoughts.)
When former District ofColumbiaMayor Vincent Gray enlisted a consortium of the city’s business schools  to create a five-year economic development strategy for the nation’s  capital, the idea seemed more novel than tactical. After all, it was an unusual assignment, especially because 16 first-year MBA students would  do much of the fieldwork.
In 2012, the mayor releasedThe Five-Year Economic Development Strategy for the District of Columbiato praise from the business community. It was a self-assured vision that  looks to generate 100,000 new jobs and $1 billion in new tax revenue by  2017. It reflected Washington's economic situation and imagined an even brighter future for the  District. It is a strategy that is both thoughtful and achievable--and, ultimately, came true.
This was long before Amazon was showing interest in the Washington region for its HQ2, which has supercharged economic development in a way we couldn't have envisioned in 2012. At the time, we were happy to think of the city and the region growing steadily to reflect a better economy and a regional commitment to economic development.
The MBA students who served as the foot soldiers in this process hailed from TheGeorge Washington University,Georgetown University,American Universityand Howard University. They broke up into teams and studied the city’s seven industry sectors—federal government and federal government  contracting, higher education and health care, hospitality, professional  services, real estate and construction, retail, and technology.
The report was a testament to the vision of then Deputy Mayor Victor Hoskins and this energetic band of student fellows who weren’t afraid to test their skills, forge a new career path (albeit  temporarily), and look with new eyes at deeply rooted economic  challenges in Washington, D.C.
The mayoral fellowship attracted top-of-the-line candidates, all stars in their own right at their various schools. When they came  together, the chemistry could be unpredictable but it also was  high-spirited and generous. It was a regular reminder that we had  recruited a smart, talented and committed group of fellows.
Our team had two Peace Corps volunteers and one Teach for America  volunteer, as well as fellows who took more traditional routes to  business school, working for Fortune 500 corporations or excelling in  consulting companies. We also had public servants who had worked around  the globe, from the U.S. Army to The Capital Markets Board in Turkey.
I was pleased to see how international our fellows were. It wasn’t  unusual for the group to talk about their adventures overseas, not just  because they liked to travel but because their families lived in distant  places like India, the Middle East and Russia. In fact one of the  fellows, Georgetown’s Sandeep Pillai, who hailed from India, invited  everyone to his wedding in India in January.
Pulling a group of ambitious MBA students together could easily turn into a festival of egos, but what was most encouraging was their ability to work in teams and bring the best out in each other. We were  especially pleased by the friendships that grew out of the fellowship, as students like Erica Clarke from Howard and Erin Monahan from American  explored the city’s arts and culture scene to pull together their  chapter on DC’s hospitality sector.
Working all summer long, the fellows interviewed more than 180 key  leaders in Washington’s private, public and academic communities, analyzed sector economic data and proposed some 50 initiatives to enhance DC’s current job creation and economic development efforts. When  they weren’t fanning out across the city, you could find them haunting  the hallways at GWSB and lunching every summer Friday, thanks to the  smart catering work of Georgetown fellow Michael Greenwald.
American’s Andrew Olson took on extra duty to guide our efforts on a  sophisticated economic impact model we used to evaluate the various  initiatives in the report. Other gifted fellows, Eric Igwe from Howard  and Chaitanya V. Gopineedi, Julia Robbins and Dmitry Terekhov of  Georgetown, matched his work and determination.
I was especially proud of the contributions of GWSB students Kevin Curley, Shruti Garhwal, Omar Hamwi, Stephan Kallus, John McKiel, Dan  Roth, Fatih Saglik and Daniel Stoops. I was impressed with their  professionalism and dedication to the project. GWSB has worked hard to  bring skilled students to our campus, and this group of individuals  represents the best in academia.
I welcomed the news that the fellowship has helped at least one of  our fellows find a permanent job. Daniel Stoops, who was on the  Strategy's federal government team, has accepted an offer from Deloitte  to start as a senior consultant in its Federal Strategy & Operations  practice after graduation. When we first envisioned this fellowship, one of our chief goals was to give students the valuable consulting  experience that would lead to a career and meaningful work. I am  heartened to hear that we have succeeded
The Five-Year Economic Development Strategy for the District of Columbiaproved nothing short of amazing. It became the guide for the mayor and his staff to implement dozens of initiatives that had been included  in the report. It was and has been a terrific model for similar partnerships between universities and government institutions. It's one that I'm proud of and hope to apply in new settings going forward.
