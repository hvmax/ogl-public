### China: A Walk Through My Neighborhood

27 March 2020|China, Coronavirus
On Global Leadership’s team of advisors includes a number of respected analysts in China, and we have periodically featured their musings and insights as they have lived through the experience of coronavirus quarantines and city-wide shutdowns. This latest installment comes from Chris Gao as he walks through his Shanghai neighborhood as it reopens again to the world. All the photos included here were taken by Chris.

My commemoration of this special period of isolation turned out to be a walk through my neighborhood on my last day of partial WFH [work from home]. I did the walk twice, once in the morning and once in the afternoon. My compound is in Zhenru in the Putuo District in northwest Shanghai. My town is named after the Zhenru Temple, built 700 years ago and located in the center of town.
Across the street from my compound, the blocked entrance to a neighbor compound reminds passersby that Shanghai is still in an epidemic-control period. For most local compounds, only one entrance is open to traffic, the rest are still blocked.
Despite the competition from online retail giants, many people still prefer fresh food from a store in their neighborhood. Fresh vegetables, especially green vegetables, are one of the daily necessities for Shanghai residents.
This pharmacy is 50 meters away from the fresh food store. No masks but enough disinfectant has been sprayed. The Shanghai government allocates five masks at cost to each family every two weeks, and that allocation is in its fourth round.
As a tradition, people go to temple to pray for peace and prosperity on the first day of the Lunar Chinese New Year. But starting from noon on Jan. 24, 2020, the Chinese New Year's Eve, all temples in Shanghai have been closed for COVID-19 prevention reasons.
Looks like the schools will be closed for another three weeks, government officials say. In Shanghai, online courses are open to students Monday through Friday. Take the first grade of primary school for example, there are six classes in one day. Each class has a 20-minute video teaching program, followed by 20 minutes of online coaching by the teacher, then a 20-minute break. Homework is assigned and students are asked to submit it to their teacher in an e-format.
Franchised restaurants and convenience stores have proved to be very reliable during the epidemic-control period. This restaurant belongs to Laoshenxin, a Chinese dim sum restaurant chain. It remained open from the first day of the lunar new year until today.
Hair salons were once considered high risk, but they are allowed to open one week ahead of parks and museums. This beauty salon has arranged a counter for temperature checking and disinfection for guests. There are another five hair salons within a 5-minute walk from this one. They have all resumed work, but those people looking for permanents and hair dying will have to wait. They’re not allowed now.
At an SF courier service station in the neighborhood, an operator is on the sidewalk allocating packages to each courier. Now shelves at the entrance of my compound have been removed and couriers are allowed to deliver directly to your door. What a relief!
To open or not open, that’s the question. The catering industry has been hit hard by the epidemic. This restaurant has about 150 seats, they reopened on March 3rd, but at least 80 percent of the seats are empty during meal times. In addition to work with online takeaway platforms like Meituan(美团), they put raw dishes at the entrance to generate impulse purchases.
The smell of Shanghainese breakfast, Sesame pizza, deep-fried dough sticks and soy milk has returned to the street. These people live in the North of Jiangsu province and are in business on this street for more than 10 years. In the past, their return always meant that Chinese New Year is over and people are back to normal life. It is especially true right now.
Though schools are still closed, rush hour traffic is back. COVID-19 has proved that you need to have your own car, no matter how difficult it is to get a license plate in Shanghai. To stimulate the economy, Shanghai increased the number of car license plates for auction in March 2020 to 11,970 pieces, an increase of 4,004 compared to February. (All cars must have license plates to operate on the streets here, but they are heavily regulated.) The average price for March auction for license plates is ￥90,141 or USD$12,877 per plate. Your chances of winning a plate is 8.9 percent.
Now, it is 3:30pm, and I am at the Shanghai Sports Palace. Its outdoor courts are now open from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.; the only indoor court open is for badminton, from 1:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. Unlike the busy guards in our office building, all this inspector can do is sit down and look at his smartphone.
After being closed for 40 days, Zhenru Park opened this past Monday. Everyone is happy to go out and enjoy the spring. The twin boys are playing in the water. Everything under the sun is older people’s topic, “a flight ticket back to China worth 180K rmb”, as some of their words blew into my ear.
This is the construction site of Shanghai subway’s Tongchuan Road Station. For seven weeks, the only thing I was able to see was a lonely cat wandering inside the fence. Now, the workers are back, so is the annoying noise of the pneumatic drill.
Back home and looking at my phone, and it is so lively—99+ unread WeChats. In one WeChat moment, there is a quarrel on how China or the U.S. government have performed since the beginning of January. In another, friends just finished a conference call with their EU head offices, which are starting to divulged what is happening: headquarters in Paris, London, or Graz are closed. For a UK retailer, one month ago the meeting was about how to catch up with the delayed shipments from China. Now, it is about how to cancel those orders. Although China is slowly recovering, the overall situation is much worse than most of us had expected.
