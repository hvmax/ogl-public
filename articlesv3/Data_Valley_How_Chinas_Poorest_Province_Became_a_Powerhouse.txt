### Data Valley: How China’s Poorest Province Became a Powerhouse

15 March 2021|China politics, Smart Cities
AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy and, in particular, life in China. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. We have sought to advance a conversation about the U.S.-China relationship, and a deep understanding of local economic development in China. We have written a series about the strategic strengthentrepreneurship in China todayas well as a series aboutChina’s Belt and Road Initiative, andChina’s big tech economyand the companies that are changing Chinese society and the world. We have also written a series about innovative local governance and economic development in China’s provinces and cities (for examplehere,hereandhere). This post seeks to extend the conversation around our research on smart cities in China today. – The Editorial Team

Among the 1.4 billion citizens of China, probably 1 billion people have not yet reached the level of middle income – at least by World Bank standards – and these people mainly reside in China’s central and western regions. China’s uneven development has been key to the Central Government’s “Go West” movement, as domestic and foreign companies are encouraged to target central and western China for new investment opportunities.
Guizhou (贵州), being one of the poorest provinces in China, has been one of the destinations in the Go West movement. Among China’s 31 provincial areas, Guizhou ranked 31st in per capital GDP in 2010. In the last decade, however, Guizhou’s prospects have changed in significant ways. On the domestic front, Guizhou is home to one of China’s most valuable companies, the Moutai Group (茅台). It is also home to data centers for tech giants such as Apple, Huawei, and Tencent. Accordingly, this poor province has created for itself a significant role in China’s rapidly growing digital economy.
Guizhou, Guiyang andGui'an
Today, Guizhou is known as the “Big Data Valley” of China, which refers to the data industry of Guiyang (贵阳) and Gui'an (贵安). We have written previously about the intricate dance between the Central Government in Beijing – with its detailed Five-Year Plans – and entrepreneurial local governments (see for example,hereandhere). This analysis illustrates critical points in the story of its development.
Let’s begin with the relationships among Guizhou, Guiyang, and Gui'an: Guizhou is a province in southwestern China, and Guiyang is the province’s capital city. Gui'an is a little more complicated. Established in January 2014, the Gui'an New Area (Gui'an) covers 20 towns or townships of four districts in Guiyang city and Anshun (安顺) city The planned area of Gui'an is 1,795 square kilometers. The administrative rank of the highest officials in Gui'an is vice-governor level, the same as that of Guiyang, and higher than Anshun’s director level. While not changing the local administrative divisions, Gui'an is an enclave that Guizhou has knitted together, a new district drawing from Guiyang and Anshun (hence the name Gui'an).
Directly managed by the province, the mission of Gui'an is to become Guizhou's Shenzhen (深圳), the manufacturing center that is widely recognized as one of the great economic development zones of the economic reform era. Today, business leaders from around the world fly in to the Guiyang airport, stay in hotels inside Guiyang, and, after negotiating their projects with provincial officials in Guiyang, they set up their business entities in Gui'an. Government agencies in Gui'an, like the tax or business administration bureaus, report directly to the province. For foreign companies, it is important to know the complexity in order to deal with the right people and understand what economic data to reference.
It is worth noting that the Statistical Yearbook of Guizhou Province does not separately list Gui'an as an independent economic entity. The GDP of Gui'an’s enterprises is allocated to Guiyang or Anshun, according to their registration address. Since the data centers of Apple, Tencent, Huawei, China Telecom, China Mobile, and China Unicom are located in the Anshun jurisdiction of Gui'an, the region’s GDP belongs to Anshun. Guiyang competes with Gui'an in attracting investment and has to support Gui'an to build its infrastructure. Such complex relationships between Guiyang and Gui'an began to change in 2019. Since October of that year, two top officials of Gui'an are held concurrently by the Party Secretary and Mayor of Guiyang, kicking off the integration of Guiyang and Gui'an. It is possible that, in the future, Gui'an and even Anshun may be merged into Guiyang, but this remains to be seen.
Leapfrogging Versus Feeling for Stones
Deng Xiaoping was famous for using the phrase “feeling for stones to cross the river” (摸着石子过河). From an economic development standpoint, the meaning of this phrase is the following: "We know where we are trying to go – economic development, poverty alleviation, prosperity, China’s return to power – but we don’t know exactly how to get there. We have to feel our way step by step. And we have to be prepared to shift our direction if this specific stone on which we are standing is not the right direction in crossing this complex river." It is a smart and sophisticated way of thinking about economic development. Rather than working from a theoretical ideological model, the approach means constantly assessing and reassessing the strategies adopted and and paths taken. But sometimes this approach means paths taken need to be abandoned.
A Brief Encounter with Qualcomm
“Turning a Corner (弯道超车)” is a phrase used by Chinese economists in their theory of late-comer advantage (后发优势). The phrase is used to describe the path for undeveloped regions to catch up with the developed regions. To achieve a developmental leap, governments of less developed regions must play their role in driving economic development, leveraging local comparative advantages to achieve an economic transformation.
Established in January 2016, Huaxintong Semiconductor Technologies (HXT) is a “late comer” project with high expectations in Guizhou. HXT is registered in Gui'an with a registered capital of ￥1.85 billion (approximately US$280 million). The joint venture was 55% owned by the Guizhou government and 45% by leading mobile chip-maker Qualcomm. HXT obtained server processor proprietary technology license from Qualcomm, targeting the data center server markets in China. HXT is held up as Guizhou’s landmark project and appeared in the Guizhou Provincial Government Work Report as a key project in 2017 and 2018. It was widely reported that Guizhou and Qualcomm had funded a combined amount of $570 million to HXT as of August 2018. On November 27, 2018, HXT announced in Beijing that it has officially started mass production of StarDragon 4800 chip, an ARM-based processor for server. Yet, just five months later, on April 30, 2019, HXT was shut down.
There are a few key reasons for the failure of HXT:
First, from the perspective of technology and market, Qualcomm’s main business is not server processors. HXT was an attempt by Qualcomm to penetrate into the server chip market, which is dominated by Intel’s X86 architecture. It is one thing to persuade companies to build data centers in Gui'an, it is another to convince companies to use HXT’s ARM chips. When Qualcomm headquarters decided to close its server chip BU in 2018, HXT lost its source of technology and its fate was doomed.
Second, from the perspective of industry and human resources, Guizhou lacks the industry background to develop server processors and the talents in R&D. The office building in Gui'an is almost the only hardware that Guizhou can provide. Although HXT was headquartered in Gui'an, its R&D and business departments were located in Beijing. Guizhou got nominal GDP and Beijing enjoyed real employment and income. Other than PR effects, the contribution and impact of HXT to Guizhou are smaller than you would expect.
Third, from a funding perspective, Guizhou lacked the financial resources to continuously invest in the chip industry. The total tax revenue of Guizhou province in 2019 was ￥120.4 billion, while the R&D expense of Shanghai-based chip manufacturer SMIC in the same year was ￥4.7 billion. Typically, the chip industry has very high threshold for entry and thus is not a sector for a poor province like Guizhou can participate in.
It now appears that HXT was a venture capital project for the Guizhou Provincial Government to incubate Qualcomm’s ARM server chips, and the incubated subject Qualcomm has withdrawn. As such, it made sense for Guizhou to shut down the HXT manufacturing plant to avoid bigger losses. While there is a chance of overtaking competitors on a corner, the risks of overturning are much bigger. The HXT project was a lesson for everyone who observed its progress.
Straightening the Curve (弯道取直): Guizhou’s New Romance with Data Centers
If “Turning the Corner” means Guizhou is still on the same track as other provinces, Guizhou’s proposal to “Straighten the Curve” is to follow its own development path. There is no reference to “big data” in any of China’s 12 Five-Year Plans, with respect to Guizhou and Guiyang. Compared with the details on informatization in the national plan, Guizhou’s true innovation was is to propose “Digital Guizhou,” and the rest on informatization are quite vague. As a project of central enterprise (央企) to support the development of underdeveloped areas, China Telecom began to build its southern data center in Gui'an in October 2013. Starting from this essential 2B real estate development project, the leaders of Guizhou have keenly seized the opportunity to get on the big data train. Nowadays, the name of Guizhou is connected with some big names like Apple, Tencent, Huawei, Foxconn, China Mobile, China Unicom, and China Telecom, making Gui'an one of the largest data hubs in China.
Even if Guizhou does not have well-known universities and research institutions focused on software and IT development and deployment, the province has beneficial factors such as a cool climate, a stable geological environment, and sufficient green energy supply:
- Guizhou’s average annual temperature is 15C, suitable for the heat dissipation required in data centers;
- Guizhou is sparsely populated and land is cheap, so the cost of building a large-scale data center is low. Additionally, there is no history of earthquakes in Guiyang and nearby areas.
- Guizhou has sufficient supply of clean energy, its installed capacity of hydro-power in Guizhou ranks No. 4 in China.
In essence, Gui'an has become the Phoenix (AZ) of China in building data centers. As an affirmation of Guizhou’s progress in the development of a big data industry, the central government proposed to “promote the construction of Guizhou and other big data pilot zones” in the 13th Five-Year Plan. At local level, Guizhou has put big data as one of the two major development strategies, and Guiyang has put forward specific development goals for 2016 through 2020, i.e., “average annual growth rate of big data-related industries should reach 35%.”
At the end of 2020, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) website published a document entitled "Accelerate the Construction of Collaborative Innovation System of National Integrated Big Data Center", jointly issued by the NDRC, Cyberspace Administration of China, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, and the National Energy Administration. The document proposes that by 2025, China will build national hub nodes for big data centers, establish a high-speed data transmission network between nodes, and carry out nationwide computing power resource scheduling. The new requirement in the document requires that “Power Usage Effectiveness or PUE of large and ultra-large data centers should drop below 1.3” has strengthened Gui'an’s attractiveness to data centers.
Guizhou doesn’t have many advantages to undertake the transfer of production capacity from coastal areas, or the ability to launch a so-called high-tech industry. As such, the province has changed its thinking process and found the right position based on its resources and assets, Guizhou’s geographical disadvantages for high-tech manufacturing now become advantages for developing data centers. By straightening the curve, Guizhou has embarked on a new development path that is different from other provinces in the East or the West.
The experience and lessons of Guizhou once again illustrate some basic business insights in China. First, as Peter Drucker once said, “The purpose of a business is to create a customer.” HXT’s attempt failed because its product was not accepted by customers. However, the success of the data center industry was built on the unique value Guizhou has created for customers. Second, Peter Drucker also said, “We must build on our strengths, not our weaknesses.” The success of the data center industry in Guizhou is built on its advantageous endowments including geographical and climate resources. HXT failed because Guizhou lacked some key elements to develop a chip industry, such as technology, talent, and capital. Third, Peter Drucker wrote, “Most leaders don’t need to learn what to do. They need to learn what to stop.” The decision to shut down HXT demonstrated the courage and ability of the Guizhou authority, which is quite rare in an environment of spreading only the good news and covering the bad. Finally, Deng Xiaoping often spoke of “Crossing the river by feeling the stones” (摸着石子过河). While development theories like leapfrog or new structural economics can provide macro-guidance for underdeveloped regions, excelling in execution is more important. Achievements are always characterized by repeated trial and error and persistence. It is by this logic that Guizhou built the Big Data Valley of China.
