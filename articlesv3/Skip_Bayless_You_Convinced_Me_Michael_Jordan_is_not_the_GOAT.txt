Dear Skip Bayless,
Your arguments about leadership have finally convinced me that LeBron James is likely professional basketball's GOAT.
Let me explain. I am a longtime Michael Jordan fan and have always believed he was the "greatest of all time" (GOAT). I was in college in Chicago in the late 1980s and early 1990s and was obsessed with Michael Jordan’s intensity and greatness when he played with the Chicago Bulls. I loved watching him play. And I have always believed he was theGreatest Player in the History of the Game.(In response to me calling out, “Michael Jeffrey Jordan!”, my kids have learned to chant, without missing a beat, “greatest player in the history of the game.” That’s the kind of Jordan fan I have been for the last 30 years. Passionate.
I have also been a fan of yours over the years. A regular listener to “First Take” and now “Undisputed,” I have heard your arguments and have agreed with the vast majority of them. But you know, as we all debate Jordan’s prowess in light of the new documentary “The Last Dance,” you have managed to convince me that my reverence for MJ, the player and the on-court leader, might have been misplaced.
Let me speak to you now, not as a fan, but from my vocation. For many years, since the late 1990s, I have been a professor of leadership at a number of esteemed business schools. I led executive education at a business school and was dean of another business school. I have worked in the corporate sector as an executive trainer to help people think about how to be and become good leaders. A primary passion in my life has been teaching young, ambitious, and aspiring executives how to be good leaders. I speak to you as a person who has thought a lot about how to train the future leaders of industries and society. Let me rephrase: how to train the future *responsible* leaders of industry and society.
In your podcast last week, you basically argued in your longstanding verbal skirmish with Shannon Sharpe (and I am paraphrasing now):
First, beyond his athletic gifts and his intensity, Michael Jordan is the GOAT because he was able to will people to rise to the level he wanted them to through whatever means. Shannon challenged you on the bullying, the intimidation, the punching people in the face. (I have known about all these things for decades — I read theJordan Rulesback then — but I was a kid and didn’t think much about them.) Even so, MJ got RESULTS. How can you argue with that? Six championships, six-and-0 in the Finals, six NBA Finals MVP Awards. At the time, I sort of thought like you: if he’s winning, who cares what it costs to get there.
Secondly, you argued, MJ is not a bad guy, and you know this because you have met him, seen him, and talked with him, a lot. You have been with him many times and you can assure us all that his intentions were and are pure.
On the first point, you are essentially arguing that results mean good leadership. If leaders achieve results, they are good leaders. We know this by virtue of the fact that they have achieved their (and their companies’) goals. Please think about this and what it means for the modern world. As I said, I have always been a staunch MJ fan and marveled at his talent, even dismissing Sam Smith’s book as “gotcha” journalism. But after 20 years of teaching leadership and trying to help young people (a few of whom have been as ambitious as Jordan but in the business world), my view has been that we have to help people understand that winning at all costs is not right.
Let’s translate your view to the corporate world for a minute. I have been an executive coach for too many executives who beat the sh*t out of their employees because they knew they had to meet their quarterly numbers. And they thought that yelling at them, berating them, abusing them was the best way to motivate them and achieve results. In some of the financial companies I advised leading up to the 2008 crisis, it was about berating people to deliver, regardless of the consequences for customers or broader society. In the end, these “leaders” were winners, because they delivered on what was expected. But were they good leaders? I don’t think so.
Or let’s look at fossil fuels. For years ExxonMobil, as the most valuable company in the world, was the “winner” in the corporate pursuit of revenues, profits, and valuation. But what has the cost been to the environment globally? Good leaders? I'm not sure everyone would agree.
Or let’s think about the famous case of Jack Welch, CEO of the Decade (for the 1990s) and Manager of the Century according to Fortune Magazine in 1999. GOAT, right? From a results perspective, I guess you would say so -- in his 20 year tenure as CEO, GE's stock rose from $14BN to over $400BN; Wall Street loved him; shareholders loved him. But his approach also earned him the nickname Neutron Jack, due to his brutal approach to layoffs, firings, and cost cutting. And look at GE now. His managerial style was mercenary and brutal and, in my view, he created a culture in GE that focused more on short-term gains than on creating a sustainable culture for the future. Great leader? Not so sure.
On your second point, let’s speak frankly. Your view is that you know Michael Jordan and you could tell he was a good person. Got it. So, as a reporter, you interviewed this charismatic famous person frequently, and you’re certain he wasn’t just being charming to a journalist who covered his every move for the local paper. You know that his “heart” was good and pure. Dude, are you kidding me? Are you that gullible? Charismatic people are very good at using their magnetism to charm people, right? I am not saying that Michael Jordan is a bad person, but you’re reminding me a bit of former President George Bush, who famously said that he looked into the eyes of Vladimir Putin and just "knew" he was a good person.
Super ambitious people are willing to do a lot — sometimes whatever it takes — to achieve their goals. And sometimes that means steamrolling people and fist fights, and other times it means smiling and charming the audience (and media) before, during, and after the game, the season, and the career.
Again, I’m not saying that Jordan is a bad person. But, personally, as somebody who has thought a lot about how to teach leadership, and reviewed a lot of the data out there on what makes good leaders, I am not convinced MJ qualifies as a great leader. Supreme talent: Yes. Unparalleled drive and intensity: Yes. Results: Yes. Great leader: Not so sure anymore.
This letter isn’t about LeBron and his qualities as a leader. That’s for another conversation. Maybe he has been a “weaker” leader. And his results have clearly not reached Jordan’s at least in terms of his Finals record. Real leaders know how to push people, but they also know how to be humble in moments of defeat, and magnanimous in moments of triumph. (I’m thinking here about Jordan’s score-settling Basketball Hall of Fame induction speech, in my opinion, was an embarrassment for everyone, including him.)
So, thanks, Skip. You have convinced me that Michael Jordan was the most talented, versatile, and driven player of all time. And he got results. But was he a great leader? No. Does he qualify as the GOAT? Probably not.
Thanks for your help in clarifying that,
