### Beijing, the Taliban, and U.S.-China Relations

AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy and, in particular, life in China. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. We have sought to advance a conversation about the U.S.-China relationship, and a deep understanding of local economic development in China. We have written about the U.S.-China Trade War as it relates toChinese Innovation;entrepreneurship in China today;anda series aboutChina’s Belt and Road Initiative. This post adds to that conversation. – The Editorial Team

U.S.-China relations have been spiraling downward for several years -- driven by both countries as they looked away from each other toward new allies, or circled the wagons internally to avoid disappointing foreign entanglements. The chasm is not insurmountable, but it is wide and deep today.
The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), which was launched in 2008, began a gradual march of China pivoting away from the West, focusing instead on building a presence and collaborating with the “Global South” (南南合作). When President Xi Jinping came to power, we began to see a more aggressive shift in the relationship between the world’s two largest economies.
Then there was the era of Donald Trump and Peter Navarro – disrespectful diplomacy, a trade war, and rising pressure for US corporations operating in China. Now, the Biden administration, after a brief period of hopeful engagement, is tracking the Trump administration with caustic comments announcing the end of the era of engagement. It has not been a good decade for U.S.-China relations.
Enter Afghanistan. What does the crisis in Afghanistan, the U.S.’s chaotic exit, the fall of the U.S.-backed Afghan government, and the rise of the Taliban mean for China and for US-China relations? The tragic events in Afghanistan have laid bare a number of issues about the role of the United States in Asia and the world and the critical precipice on which US-China relations sit. A number of scholars, reporters, and pundits have examined the role China will play in the continuing transformation of Afghanistan and its role in the region.
One theory is that China’s presence in the reason will grow because of the economic opportunity there. In one recentarticle, Viola Zhou tells the story of one Chinese entrepreneur Mr. Liu: “When the fall of Kabul hit the news, Liu found his potential turnaround. In a more stable Afghanistan governed by the unrivaled Taliban, Liu speculated, an explosion in new construction would lead to skyrocketing demand for power systems… ‘If the Taliban rules the country on its own, infrastructure building will be a focus. I want to go get a slice of that.’”
Council on Foreign Relations Expert, Ian Johnson, agrees that the relationship will be largely mercantilistic, though the investment will extend beyond China’s growing entrepreneurial class. As Johnson puts it, “China will seek to revive business ventures inside Afghanistan, which the Taliban is likely to support because investment will provide badly needed revenues. The Afghan economy is fragile and highly dependent on Western donors’ foreign aid, which will almost certainly be cut off.” Johnson also makes the interesting point that Beijing will also likely take the opportunity to model for the world engagement without judgement: “China’s engagement in Afghanistan can show other countries how China supports regimes: with few questions asked as long as they support Chinese interests.”
Emily Feng’s reporting for NPR (here) focuses on BRI issues. Quoting other experts, Feng writes that “Chinese strategists have long had their eye on Afghanistan as part of China's massive infrastructure project, the Belt and Road Initiative. Afghanistan provides China with a potential path to Iran and Turkey that avoids the Pacific Ocean, where the U.S. and its allies wield power. It also allows China to circumvent Central Asian countries where Russia retains influence.”
Of the analyses out there – and there are many more than the examples we have cited above – we believe Feng’s emphasis on BRI makes the most sense for what we are seeing in China today. Viola Zhou’s analysis is difficult to see, as Afghanistan has been decimated by two decades of war and is heavily dependent on foreign aid, which is now likely to run for the exits following the U.S. exit. Johnson’s analysis has the intriguing foreign affairs insight that China might use this moment as an example of nonjudgmental diplomacy. However, from our on-the-ground perspective, we believe the most important factor is BRI.
As we have writtenpreviously, “BRI aims to connect Asia, Africa, and Europe through a network of railways, ports, roads and Internet infrastructure. The Belt refers to the Silk Road Economic Belt, and the Road refers to 21st Century Maritime Silk Road. China hopes to borrow the symbol of the ancient Silk Road to transform its infrastructure construction advantages in capacity, technology, and capital into new markets as well as bilateral or multilateral cooperation platforms. Additionally, it could expand into fields like cultural and people-to-people exchanges. The BRI base has changed over time, and many countries have been included in BRI initiatives that were not a part of the original BRI concept (e.g., New Zealand, Brazil). The BRI stands out as an engagement with the world at a time when many existing multilateral efforts are facing deadlock. According the World Bank, BRI projects in all sectors that are already executed, in process, or planned are estimated to amount to USD$575 billion.
So, let’s think about Afghanistan now. The country is not exceptionally mineral, rare earths, or energy rich. But it is a pipeline between China and Iran. Thus, it is a direct road to one of the most energy rich countries in the world (Iran is No. 4 in oil reserves in the world). As of one week ago, Iran has resumed its export of oil to Afghanistan, which is surely a set up for building a more direct pipeline to China. We don’t refute the notion of Beijing modeling for the world what it means to engage diplomatically without judgement; or the notion that some Chinese entrepreneurs and State-Owned Enterprises might make money through infrastructure development in Afghanistan. However, our view is that this is largely about BRI.
BRI, China’s Marshall Plan, is about building the infrastructure that helps China continue pivoting away from the West, setting themselves at the leader of South-South Cooperation (南南合作). This is not a small hedge; this is an economic plan that has been in the works for over a decade. And as the United States exits from Afghanistan, it’s role in the region will continue to diminish, and China’s role in the region will continue to grow.
This is a crucial time for the global political economy, especially with respect to influence in Asia and the Middle East, home to two-thirds of the world’s population. The U.S.’s withdrawal from Afghanistan was probably inevitable. However, this moment coupled with the U.S.’s recent abandonment of the engagement policy, essentially cedes the region to the world’s soon-to-be largest economy. So, instead of collaborating with China, the United States is exiting, and we are leaving the continent to China.
Bottom line: engagement, partnership, and respectful diplomacy are better than competition and confrontation.
