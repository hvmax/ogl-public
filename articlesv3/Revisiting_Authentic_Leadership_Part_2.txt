### Revisiting Authentic Leadership, Part 2

12 January 2021|Creative Leadership, Leadership, Leadership Development
In the second entry in our Authentic Leadership series, we look beyond narrowly fixed determinants of authenticity, particularly awareness and knowledge of an innate self, or measures of extreme individualism, like low monitoring and an internalized moral perspective. Instead, learning from the experiences of actors and musicians, our focus is on the potential for leaders to make continuing efforts atauthenticationas ongoing processes of the active reinvention, navigation of others’ perceptions, and evolution of their multiple selves.  -- OGL Editors
Making sense of the evolving self-presentation and perceptions of artists
Inthe first post in this series, tracing the history of management and, especially, psychological studies of behavioral authenticity cast light on some of the far-reaching complications that emerge from the predominant theory and practice ofauthentic leadership. Yet the piece concluded with a suggestion that those very critiques of authentic leadership grounded in an unfiltered, knowable, and innate self could serve as the basis for a more dynamic alternative approach to authenticity that embraces multiple selves and ongoing transformation. Put more simply, if one stipulates that change and growth is essential to leaders (and to all people), that we adapt and choose who we aim to be and which actions to take in becoming, then questions remain about which choices we make and why. In other words, letting go of a strictly linear understanding of an innate self somehow moving through life does not entirely vitiate the potential connections between an individual’s past, current, and future selves: rather than a realm of infinite or utterly random possibilities, there remain important continuities and coherences that, whether looking backward or forward, still help to make us who we are.
To explore that claim more concretely, this second entry will look at the experiences of actors and musicians. In these fields, extensive analyses, sometimes extending over centuries, have sought to explain authenticity in terms of artifice and superficiality, personas and performance, aesthetic and institutional contexts, and individual evolution. Many of these accounts remain grounded in the same tenets of Western philosophy as the psychological research that aims to deconstruct authenticity into specific behaviors or other traits. For example, the assumptions include the possibility of being oneself – that is, who one really is versus playing another role – or behaving in ways faithful to one’s principles or values. Yet for a given individual, it is the fluidity of interactions over time rather than the fixity of an unchanging self that marks the authenticity of being and behaving as oneself.
Paradoxes of Authenticity and of Acting
In 2015, London Business School’s Herminia Ibarra argued that “The Authenticity Paradox” – in which leaders who try to adhere to a rigid self-concept, practice utter transparency, and entirely value-based choices – undermined their ability to transform themselves, maintain credibility, and adapt to new challenges. Her claim that the central need for leaders to curate how they present themselves in different situations, often potentially conflicting with one’s internal sense of self, recalls other disciplinary efforts to reconcile often disparate behaviors and self-presentation with an individual’s inner life, emotions, and thinking. The question of how individuals present themselves and their roles in theatrical settings, while acting, has long been the subject for intensive, and, unsurprisingly, varied examinations that can help us to set our own thinking about leadership authenticity in wider contexts.
Acknowledging many distinct schools of dramatic performance, it is helpful to begin with a major contrast betweenclassicalandnaturalisticacting. In the appropriately titled, “The Paradox of Acting” (1770-1778), FrenchphilosopheDenis Diderot describes the classical view thata separation always exists between a role played and the real person playing it. The more creative and expressive actors rely on self-control and detachment in conveying emotions, for instance, without feeling those passions on a personal level (what he called “sensibility”) while performing. Naturalistic acting, articulated in the foundational theories of Russian theater actor and director Constantin Stanislavski, believes that an actor needs to “experience the role” by drawing on their own feelings from experiences in their own lives. InBuilding a Character(1948), Stanislavski underscores the great discipline required for rehearsal, butin the performance itself, the actor’s feelings and behaviors blend with those of the role. Importantly, in an earlier work,An Actor Prepares(1936), Stanislavski does recognize thatan individual can “never lose [themself] on stage, as an actor,” thereby seemingly differentiating a unitary personal self from a more expansive and dynamic performing one (177).
We might unpack various lessons here for leaders. First, experiencing emotions has become more and more central to leadership thinking and practice with the ascendance over the past three decades of the topic of Emotional Intelligence. Among the key tenets of EQ popularized by science journalist Daniel Goleman arethe awareness and regulation of emotions, both of which resonate with some of the central dynamics engaged by actors. A second lesson concerns the physicality of leadership. While this is sometimes discussed in terms of leadershippresence, some research has examined“embodied authentic leadership” that can be created through a leader’s self-exposure, relating to others, and “making leaderly choices”(Ladkin & Taylor 2010). A third lesson here, built into most types of theatrical training, involvesthe “moment-to-moment relationships”that actor Steven S. Taylor asserts are crucial for establishing authenticity between performers and with audiences. For leaders, too, enacting everyday leadership beyond major symbolic moments can be a potentially transformative practice (2013: 179).
The more specific dynamics of a leader’s relationships with other people are obviously crucial. While a theatre audience needs to believe that an actor embodies a character, despite knowing intellectually they do not, those around leaders need to accept them across both these and other registers of interaction. For our discussion, expanding the focus from individual leaders’ behaviors to their interactions with others entails examining theperceived authenticityof those leaders and what sociologists call “impression management.” That term originated in groundbreaking 1959 work of Erving Goffman,The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life, which relies on a dramaturgical understanding that one’s sense of self is dependent upon the specifics of time, place, and audience. Goffman thus argues thatan individual both “guides himself and his activity to others [and] the ways in which he guides and controls the impression they form of him”(xi). Beyond attending to their own behaviors and sense of self, in other words, leaders must attend to how their interactions are perceived by others.
These compound interactions can involve multiple factors that bear on the leader’s perceived authenticity. For instance, management researcher Anna Weischer argues that among thekey variables of perceived authenticity, besides the leader’s own actions, are the “romance of leadership” embraced by other, their “sympathy towards the leader” and “trust in the leader,” the “perceived leadership effectiveness,” and dependent variables. Yet a simpler and perhaps more immediately helpful reminder comes from General Stanley McChrystal, whose model of the reality of leadership, which he casts as “an emergent property” of the ongoing interactions between leaders, followers, and contexts, also relies on more than concrete behaviors and results alone. Rather, McChrystal acknowledges that“symbolism, identity, purpose, future potential” and other intangibles shape the impressions of leaders and complicate the perceptions of their authenticity(2018: 896). A further paradox, then, is that flesh-and-blood individual leaders act, transform and make sense of themselves even as others interact with and perceive them as leader-symbols – both often driven by their own respective standards of authenticity.
Emotional Truth and Faking it in Music
Understanding the relationships between leaders and others, like those between actors and audiences, entails examining more deeply both the bases of social interactions and the wider contexts in which they occur. InActing With Power, Stanford social psychologist Deborah Gruenfeld picks up Goffman’s line of thinking to assert that, “Acting, then, is not trying to be someone else. Acting is a disciplined approach – a code of conduct – for managing yourself” (84). Her recommendation to all leaders to be better actors, and in the process to bring out the best parts of themselves and lead others more successfully, is grounded in understanding and managing the power that exists in every relationship. While power is an essential component, both authenticity and acting involve other key attributes and dynamics. To explore them, it will be helpful to turn to another creative and cultural realm – popular music – in which the discourse of authenticity has been central to historical accounts of both the industry and the wider culture it engages.
The discourse of authenticity is central to a range of popular and, especially, rock music criticism and commentary. Critic Philip Auslander, for example, has emphasizedthe value of an artist’s public persona, private self, and their songs and performances all being alignedin both presentation and perception. Other commentators, notably Simon Frith, make similar a claim at the industry level: a longstanding, if historically shifting, argument is that specific styles or genres of music – hillbilly, country, blues, folk, rock ‘n’ roll – are genuine and authentic because they featuremusicians whose songs and performances are marked by the direct expression of their individual and inner emotional truth. In contrast, “pop” music is fake and fabricated, with the public personas, productions, and performances largely contrived for commercial purposes. Allan Moore recognizes thatthe determination of musical authenticity is often in the eye of the beholder, in the perception of authenticity, and thus less an innate or essential quality than an “experiential” one based in impressions of a performer’s genuineness or fakeness.

These sweeping dynamics can be illustrated by specific events or individual artists. For many, an epochal performance in music history was Bob Dylan’s appearance at the 1965 Newport Folk Festival, when he provoked outrage by playing an electric guitar – the very symbol, for many, of mannered, technologically mediated, and inauthentic music. That Dylan appeared live also underscores the centrality of performance, of emotional immediacy and intimacy, with an audience in the consideration of musical authenticity. In the following decades, David Bowie, in his glam rock incarnation as Ziggy Stardust and through the embodiment of subsequent personas and musical styles, would not only test but up-end that guiding logic. Historian Lawrence Grossberg cites Bowie as a central example when writing that the large-scale cultural commoditization of authenticity in the 1960s and early 1970s gave way to another “logic of authentic inauthenticity” in which “the only possible claim to authenticity is derived from the knowledge and admission of your inauthenticity” or performance (1993: 205-6).

The discourse around authenticity in music extended beyond these decades fraught with wider debates about being real or fake. In the 1980s and 1990s, especially, hip-hop music rose to prominence as a genre tied to the specific experience of social and economic marginalization of African Americans. “Realness” and “truth” were consistent topics in songs, served as a key attribute of individual rapper’s reputation, and, as the late literary and music scholar Jonathan Williams argued, helpedto demarcate and maintain the boundaries around the African-American urban subculture from which it emerged. With “fakeness,” the presentation and perception of “assimilation” with the larger mainstream culture became the grounds of inauthenticity to avoid. The rise of rapper Eminem was controversial for some in the hip-hop community and the music industry because his Whiteness precluded his sharing the full racialized experience many believed central to hip-hop realness. Williams perceptively notes that authenticity in hip hop grew more adaptable, often still focused on a rapper being true to himself but also potentially remaining true to the urban streets or to “the underground” that resists mainstream values (5).

More recently, in the 2010s,Lana Del Rey epitomized the persisting contrast between musical authenticity and artifice. In 2011, the singer gave a series of performances, including one broadcast nationally onSaturday Night Live, that many saw as evidence that she was poseur with little talent whose productions and career had been orchestrated by her producers and music label and driven by social media. According to journalists Alex Abad-Santos and Constance Grady, “authentic” in Del Rey’s case initially invoked the older paradigm that had been associated with rock music: it meant the musician wrote their own songs, played their own instruments, and performed live (never lip-synching). By 2020, however, Del Rey released an album,Norman Fucking Rockwell, that some critics ranked as among the best of the decade and she was widely viewed as a legitimate musical star. Abad-Santos and Grady argue that the intervening decade saw a major shift in the clash between what they callrockismandpoptimism– making pop music as a genre pop’s equal, and the seeming artifice or theatricality of its performers, like Del Rey, the bases of “a new kind of authenticity.”
InFaking It, Yuval Taylor and Hugh Barker drawa crucial distinction between “personal” and “cultural” authenticity.They argue that the eventual public acceptance of Dylan’s continual reinvention derives less from a notion of his personal sincerity and more from rock ‘n’ roll’s greater concern with his shifting embrace of its own varied traditions. The singer-songwriter’s December 2020 sale of his music catalog to Universal Music could be viewed as just the latest example of his embrace of the changing nature of the industry. Similarly, addressing debates around authentic leadership, Stanford’s Jeffrey Pfeffer observes that there arethose who are authentic to themselves and those who are authentic to situations(2015). For both musicians and leaders, authenticity can thus be shaped by the dynamic interactions of individuals making choices about the bases of their own behaviorsandthe perceptions of authenticity of the people in those cultural or situational contexts. Whether audiences or team members or investors in a marketplace, these other persons and their perceptions are essential to defining the public personas of performers and leaders alike. Moreover, as shape-shifting musicians like Dylan and Bowie illustrate, those perceptions can vary enormously, from audiences viewing authenticity as an unchanging voice of an immutable self to an evolving expression of a genuine journey of self-discovery.
Art of Leadership Authentication
Framed in these terms – individuals making a choice to present themselves as faithful to their own principles or adapting to a situation, while being perceived by others as acting in ways congruent with a core self or engaged in ongoing reinvention – authenticity is an unwieldy construct. Yet it is necessary to complicate this approach further. Most obviously, with the passage of time, each of the key variables, notably the interactions between an individual leader’s (or musician’s) decisions or actions and others, like team members (or the audience of a performance), can change. It is also necessary to move beyond the binary choices between being true to self or situation, or audiences perceiving fixed identities or an ever-changing and adaptive persona (or even choosing between authenticity or inauthenticity). InWhy Should Anyone Be Lead By You(2006), London Business School professors Rob Goffee and Gareth Jones memorably recommended “being authentic enough” as an optimal middle way for leaders. Likewise, when she posed the apposite question, if a leader strives to be true to oneself, “Which self?”, Herminia Ibarra underscored the multiple possibilities for self-development and transformation that were possible beyond traditional conceptions of authenticity.
It is important, however, not to go too far and conclude from Ibarra’s question that no questioning at all about possible selves, or the touchstones of authenticity they represent, can be productive. Even as a leader moves beyond trying to base their actions or growth in a fixed and innate (and ultimately past) self, the possibilities for transformation before the leader still have links to specific settings occupied by that leader. The choices made by leaders and, again, how they are perceived are not random; they are still marked by the personal and professional worlds that leader has experienced or been exposed to. To illustrate, consider the world of art or, as Howard Becker put it in the title of his standard work in the sociology of culture,Art Worlds(1982). Here,the work of the artist is a social enterprisein which a huge range of people play interdependent roles to produce an artifact that a social group then decides to designate and value as art. Becker subsequently useda cinematic “end-credits metaphor”to emphasize his point: while the artist may not know exactly which artifact they want to create, or whom they want to become in the process, their individual choices and actions nevertheless adhere to or deviate from the rules of specific personal, stylistic, industrial, and social contexts. Put more simply, authenticity, whether to oneself or to one’s situation or culture, may be complex but remains bounded.
Acknowledging the multiple contexts in which one may strive for authenticity both in one’s actions and others’ perceptions raises an important further set of issues. For top leaders, the authentic persona associated with being, and being seen as, oneself may be both possible and appealing. But for others negotiating distinct social expectations and demands, being authentic to self and others entails bringing oneself into situations of possible harassment, discrimination, and identity-based micro-aggressions. For women and other traditionally marginalized groups, there are typically added obstacles and even costs to being seen as abnormal or potentially unsuitable for belonging to a given culture or enterprise. If perceptions by others are essential to a more dynamic approach to being authentic, it is crucial to recognize the unequal challenges of beingvisible– that is,being “regarded and recognized by others and impression management”– in professional settings (Lewis & Simpson 2010). As recent research makes clear, different individuals navigate widely varyingconditions of visibility(hierarchies, spatial separation, sexualized or stigmatized visibility) that result in theirhaving often to manage being invisible, hypervisible, or precariously or partially visible(Buchanan & Settles 2018).
In response to these increasingly complex dynamics around the presentation of the self and perceptions of others, no singular standard of authenticity exists. Rather, what the ongoing reinvention and social interactions of artists make clear is the need to conceive of authenticity taking place over time – not as an endpoint but as an active process ofauthentication. Without her using the word, this is similar to what Ibarra advocates in calling for a “design thinking for the self,” which explicitly parallels the process of experimentation and innovation in design thinking for products. It also resonates with the practices of varied intellectual and philosophical traditions. For example, in a journal entry from November 1842, American transcendentalist Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, “Don't be too timid & squeamish about your actions. All life is an experiment. The more experiments you make, the better” (294). More recently, in the aptly titled,The Art of Authenticity, management consultant Karissa Thacker writes, “The art of authenticity is the process of inventing yourself. It is an active process of experimentation and figuring things out...” (116).
Thacker also makes the point that, “The Greek root of the word authentic is author. On a practical level, being authentic means that you are the author of your own life. The notion of being self-authoring, editing, and publishing is possible in this era in a literal way as well as a metaphorical way” (46-7). We might tweak that notion to ensure that the authoring and revision becomes collaborative work with others who regularly read and co-edit the ongoing processing of one’s self-authoring. To paraphrase Deborah Gruenfeld, theatricality and role-playing are not only ways of conducting oneself as an artist or a leader but of continuously growing in those roles and, presumably, as a private person, too. Embracing that active presentation of oneself as a continuing process of authentication, perceived and reflexively shaped by others, becomes an invaluable basis for enhancing both learning and leadership.
In the third and concluding piece in this series, we will look more closely at the social and ethical dimensions of authentication, explore how notions of ‘craft’ and ‘character’ can deepen our understanding of authenticity and help to enhance one’s leadership practice, and finally introduce the concept of ‘selfmaking’ to describe the evolving interdependencies among individual leaders, others, and their contexts and work together.
