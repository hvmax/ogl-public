At On Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy and, in particular, life in China. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. We have written about economic development in China and China’s economic reforms, U.S.-China relations, China’s changing role in the global political economy, and the history and current state of Chinese politics. With the rising trade tensions between China and the United States, one of the key sectors to be impacted by the battling will be automobile manufacturing. We have written about this issue previously, for examplehere,here,here. In this post, we add to our analysis of the importance of the auto industry in China with a focus on China’s rising star in the electric vehicle sector, BYD.
BYD NEEDS A NEW PRICE STRATEGY: CHINA’S AUTO-INDUSTRY DOESN’T BUY WANG CHUANFU’S TEARS
On June 6, 2025, China’s auto industry showed division. At BYD’s Shenzhen headquarters, founder and Chairman Wang Chuanfu shed tears when saying “BYD is my life,” following expressions of support from shareholders. On the same day at the Chongqing Auto Forum, Geely’s vice president Yang Xueliang was shouting “laws not enforced, violations not investigated, and lax enforcement,” directing his criticism at BYD.
This dramatic contrast highlights the challenges facing China’s new energy vehicle (NEV) industry after years of rapid growth: the market has shifted to fierce competition for share, with price wars now common.
The story began on May 23, 2025, when BYD announced a comprehensive price cut across 22 models in its Dynasty Series and Ocean Series. The “523 Price War” marked BYD’s third round of price cuts within two months (1). Notably, this wave of reductions focused on intelligent driving models, offering unprecedented reductions of 10% to 34%. The market reacted swiftly and harshly: within a week, nearly ten brands, including Geely Galaxy, Chery, and SAIC Roewe, followed suit, sparking industry-wide concern over a new price war. In the capital markets, Hong Kong-listed auto stocks fell broadly the day after BYD’s announcement, with BYD leading the drop at 8% and its shares declining 14% over ten trading days.
Such rat-race competition has drawn regulatory attention. On May 31, the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM) released theInitiative to Safeguard Fair Competition and Promote Healthy Industry Development. While not naming specific companies, it criticized BYD’s latest price war for intensifying cutthroat competition, which could further erode corporate profit margins, compromise product quality and after-sales service, and ultimately hinder the sector’s healthy development. This behavior also jeopardizes consumer rights and poses potential safety risks. The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) promptly endorsed the initiative, stating that disorderly “price wars” among automakers represent a classic case of involution and pledging to strengthen efforts to curb such practices within the auto industry.
Beyond scattered social media endorsements, BYD’s price war has faced widespread criticism. Let’s explore the reasons behind through the following aspects：
Undermining Industry Ecology– Fueled by the vehicle trade-in subsidy program, China produced 10.12 million automobiles from January to April 2025, up 11% YoY. During this period, industry revenue reached ¥3.26 trillion (+7% YoY), but profits fell to ¥132.6 billion (-5.1% YoY). The profit margin dropped to 4.1%, compared to 4.3% in 2024 and well below the 5.6% average for downstream industrial enterprises. Against this backdrop, BYD’s price war could trigger a Prisoner’s Dilemma-style herd effect among rivals. If unchecked, these spiral risks industry-wide losses for China’s automotive industry.Strong-Arming Suppliers Into Price Cuts– Automakers often use their buyer dominance to force price reductions from downstream suppliers, a tactic BYD has taken to extremes. In late November 2024, BYD issued ano-replyemail demanding a 10% price cut, with new quotations due by December 15 and full implementation by January 1, 2025. While seeking supplier concessions is common in the industry, BYD’s aggressive approach has been criticized as bullying.Squeezing Suppliers’ Capital– BYD has extended the industry’s prevalent Other People’s Money (OPM) strategy to the limit through its proprietary D-Chain supply chain finance instrument. D-Chain is a payment tool backed by BYD’s credit, targeting small and medium-sized suppliers. It works as follows: When paying suppliers, BYD issues D-Chain vouchers with 9-12 month payment terms. If suppliers need early liquidity, they must pay discount interest rates of 8%-10%.This arrangement drastically cuts BYD’s financing needs. As a result, BYD’s interest-bearing debt ratio is only 4.9%, far below the 30%-68% range of major global automakers (e.g., Volkswagen 32%, Toyota 68%, Ford 66%). This highlights BYD’s strong supply chain dominance.Undermining Long-Term Consumer Interests– While price wars may boost sales temporarily, their negative effects are significant. Frequent price cuts encourage consumers to delay purchases, anticipating further discounts. Aggressive pricing turns brands to “value-for-money” perceptions, raising quality concerns and eroding brand loyalty. Additionally, new-car discounts lower used-vehicle resale values, affecting future trade-ins or resale. This cycle distorts market pricing mechanisms and undermines the industry’s value propositions.Adverse Impacts on Dealers– While short-term price cuts may boost sales, they squeeze profit margins, increase inventory pressure, and strain cash flow. In April 2025, Qiancheng Group, BYD’s largest regional dealer with over 20 4S stores in Shandong, collapsed due to a cash flow crisis(2). This left many consumers with unfulfilled prepaid service packages and vehicle registration issues, as certificates were held as collateral by financial institutions.

This left many consumers with unfulfilled prepaid service packages and vehicle registration issues, as certificates were held as collateral by financial institutions.
BYD’s vertical integration model (e.g., 75% in-house production rate for its Dolphin model) ensures supply chain autonomy but requires massive capital expenditure. From 2020 to 2024, annual sales surged from 427,000 to 4.27 million units, with over ¥400 billion (about $58 billion) in capital expenditures consuming significant operating cash flow and resulting in only ¥120 billion in cumulative free cash flow over five years. The business model leverages economies of scale to reduce costs and boost sales, enabling further capacity expansion and cost cuts. This capital-intensive cycle creates strategic dependency: high fixed costs and asset turnover pressures force BYD to continuously initiate price wars as both an offensive strategy and defensive necessity, maintaining sales momentum to justify capacity utilization while stabilizing earnings.
BYD is undoubtedly an exceptional enterprise. Its engineer-driven culture of “technology supremacy, innovation-first” and highly efficient operations have been key to its success. Wang Chuanfu’s emotional moments at shareholders’ meetings, whether lamenting entrepreneurial challenges or expressing frustrations over being misunderstood, highlight the human side of corporate leadership. However, in critical industry-wide moments, such personal emotions cannot overshadow the widespread concerns sparked by its price war strategy.
As China’s top automaker and a global industry giant, BYD’s decisions now transcend its corporate interests. What BYD needs is not the label of “price slasher”, but the courage to drive the industry’s upward breakthrough. BYD must urgently recalibrate its strategic course, abandon outdated strategies centered on squeezing supply chain profits and pursuing market share through “eliminating” competitors. A true industry leader should embrace technological stewardship, co-creation of value, and ecosystem prosperity, steering China’s auto industry out of the impasse of price war toward the blue ocean of sustainable development.
