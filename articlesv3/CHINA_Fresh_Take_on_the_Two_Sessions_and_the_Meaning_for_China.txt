### CHINA: Fresh Take on the “Two Sessions” and the Meaning for China

24 June 2020|China, Supply Chain, US-China Relations
AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy and, in particular, life in China. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. We are building an economic database of cities in China to better understand how jurisdictions cope with today’s economic and political forces, as well. We have sought to advance a conversation about what leadership in these times of crisis might look like. In this post, we provide additional insights into our views about the recent National People’s Congress (NPC) and how we might think of the priorities of President Xi and Premier Li. In this post, we discuss the government’s emphasis on the Yangtze River Delta (YRD), GDP growth targets and fiscal policy, Hainan Island, and the “Double-Circulation System.” We will examine each of these issues in greater detail in future posts. – The Editorial Team

While the world is busy analyzing the audacious vision laid out in Premier Li Keqiang’s 2020 Government Work Report, and awaits reaction from President Trump to Beijing’s new security law for Hong Kong, action has begun on the ground to execute the bold vision.
The report was presented at the “Two Sessions” this year. The name is a shorthand for the back-to-back government meetings convened in Beijing where over 5,000 representatives from across China meet for the plenary session of the National People’s Congress (NPC) and the annual meeting of the National Committee of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC). Because of COVID-19, the meetings were delayed, only just finishing on May 28.
Almost directly after the Two Sessions ended, Chinese regional leaders gathered together and pressed the fast forward button. The 2020 Forum of Major Leaders of the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) was held in the ancient silk city of Huzhou, about an hour from Shanghai in Zhejiang Province, on June 6.
The YRD which encompasses the eastern Chinese provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, and the Shanghai Municipality, is one of the country's most dynamic regions in terms of reform development, level of openness, and innovation capabilities. During the past 30 years, economic reform in this region of China has been a major economic driver for the regionandthe country. The area is home to 15 percent of China's population and contributes roughly a quarter of the country's GDP. It also contributed more than a third of its foreign trade and investment in 2019, with a value of 11.24 trillion yuan (USD1.58trillion).
The forum called for efforts to strengthen innovation and enhance the YRD's ability to pool and allocate global resources so as to strengthen its position in the global industrial value chains. [S1] Concerted efforts were made to explore integrated institutional innovation, strengthen ability to allocate resources, promote a new type of urbanization and rural revitalization, and address problems such as unequal development, epidemic prevention and control, industrial supply chain modernization, environmental protection, and develop world-class industrial clusters in the region.
The leaders of this dynamic region initiated 1,390 integrated projects equal to 7.8 trillion yuan (USD1.1trillion). There are major infrastructure projects on the list such as an intercity high speed train, and a new airport on the north side of the Yangtze River in Nantong, Jiangsu. This location will be the third side of the Shanghai international aviation hub, which includes the Pudong International Airport and the Hong Qiao International Airport.
With COVID-19 still a major issue in everyday life, what was the hurry for the regional heads to initiate such ambitious deals and commit to vast infrastructure projects? The “Two Sessions” sets the direction of the Chinese government at every level as well as industry and business. There was no time to waste getting on with delivering on the new targets. The key to success of the past 40 years of economic development has been establishing good old fashioned KPIs. However, they may not always be applied smartly.
First, no GDP growth target?
What does this mean? Of course, it’s the result of the uncertainty at this time. In this instance while GDP target was dropped for the near term, job creation is now imperative number one. If the government were to establish a GDP target it could be mistaken for business as usual. Instead by establishing a fresh target, everyone looks at the problem from a quality of life stand point, rather than a purely financial position. Simple: put people’s lives first.
Yet the premier’s report has a clear requirement on jobs: increase 9 million new urban jobs, keep surveyed unemployment around 6 percent and register around 5.5 percent. Jobs are typically the function of growth. A very rough estimate, a growth rate of 1 percent would result in about 2 million jobs. So, we are looking at a 4.5 percent growth if Premier Li wants to secure 9 million new jobs. (Li said in his May 28, 2020, press conference that some 8.74 million fresh college graduates will be looking for jobs alone.)
Second, monetary policy is conservative and fiscal policy flexible but cautious
"We will use a variety of tools such as required reserve ratio reductions, interest rate cuts, and re-lending to enable the M2 money supply and aggregate financing to grow at notably higher rates than last year,” noted the Government Work Report 2020. In 2019, M2 was 8.38 percent and aggregated financing was 10.69 percent. “Notably higher” means 15 percent, 18 percent, or more? This leaves plenty of room for adjustment throughout the process to iterate and pivot.

It looks like a lot of money. Consider, however, that Q1 fiscal income was down by -26.1 percent, and it is forecast over the next couple of months that it will remain at negative levels, with reductions in taxes and even with promised fees. The money will hardly fill the hole.
The pandemic has raised its head again in Beijing, and will remain with us for a long while, bringing uncertainty from region to region, and government spending will be unabated for ad hoc COVID-19 events. In other words, it is sure that all levels of government will be spending and investing frugality, which is not a bad thing.
Third, a bright spot came on June 1, 2020, for a reinvigorated plan for Hainan Province
The autonomous region of Hainan has been struggling for centuries to find its position.  Sometimes autonomous, sometimes part of other provinces, Hainan became a separate province under the PRC in its latest iteration as a Special Economic Zone (SEZ) in 1988.
A tropical island, equal in size to Belgium, Hainan is located in the south. The closest major airport is Guangzhou in Guangdong Province. There have been many government-sponsored grand visions launched to turn Hainan into a tropical getaway to compete with Thailand, complete with resort hotels and ethnic villages of the Li Minority people who are the original inhabitants of the island. A high-speed circular train was finished in 2015 to tie the entire island together. Medical tourism was tried for a while. Provincial leaders came and went, and not just any leaders. China Vice President Wang Qishan (王岐山) took a spin as the provincial head back in 2003 before the SARS epidemic took him back to Beijing. Historically, Hainan was a place of banishment for those who displeased the emperor. Perhaps that is how most of the assigned leaders saw their roles. Keep the proverbial oil lamps burning while they waited to be reassigned to other jobs.
Great hopes were raised when Hainan was granted Pilot Free Trade Zone (FTZ) status in 2018 on the 30th anniversary of being an autonomous region. With tropical fruit and industries such as rubber production and resort-type beaches, plans were drawn up to include Hainan in the blueprint of the Greater Bay Area (GBA) plan. The GBA plan encompasses the Pearl River Delta region including Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Macau, which represents 11 percent of the country’s GDP in 2019 compared to Hainan’s GDP contribution of .5 percent (smaller than the city of Xiamen). Foreign investors have expressed frustration with the delays in policy creation, lack of focus by the leaders sent by Beijing to lead the province, and no ideas on an executable plan. Multiple conferences later, eyes tend to roll when yet another high-level vision is crafted for the island economy.
What’s so special this time around? In today’s Chinese political context, the person who leads a project demonstrates the level of recognition and support a project will have. This time Beijing is sending the big guns. The Hainan general reform plan is led by:
Han Zheng (韩正), Politburo standing committee member, vice premier;Hu Chunhua (胡春华), Politburo committee member, vice premier; andHe Lifeng (何立峰), director of the National Development and Reform Committee (NDRC).
• Han Zheng (韩正), Politburo standing committee member, vice premier;
• Hu Chunhua (胡春华), Politburo committee member, vice premier; and
• He Lifeng (何立峰), director of the National Development and Reform Committee (NDRC).
If two vice premiers plus the head of the most important functional department of the state council can’t figure it out, Hainan is doomed. With the appointment announcement, a billion heads swiveled to take a second look at Hainan. No one can ignore the potential for directing financial support, pushing policy reforms, and attracting human resources to the island. With strong backers such as Pony Ma of Tencent and Jack Ma of Alibaba might there be a need for a second look?
Additionally, the Hainan grand plan was announced only three days after the passing of the Hong Kong security law. Many speculated that Hainan was being positioned to compete with Hong Kong, which was a bit of a stretch considering the size of Hainan’s economy and its development stage. It does seem to be benchmarked against Hong Kong, especially with in regard to the taxes. However, Hainan’s free trade port (FTP, 海南自由贸易港) is a relatively new concept as of 2018, but there has been little or no action since. After the failures of international tourism, the housing bubble, and duty-free shopping, Beijing really must understand the reluctance for immediate engagement. However, this time it may be a matter of time with such senior leaders with incredible track records behind them. There are already new policies proposed to kick start this latest effort. To name a few:
FTP will offer a 0 percent import tariff;Business taxes will be set at 15 percent (China, as a whole, is 25 percent);Individual Income Tax (IIT) would be capped at 15 percent (China, as a whole, is 45 percent);Domestic visitors to Hainan will be given an allowance of 100,000 yuan (USD$14,000) worth of duty-free per annum;Establish a free flow of capital account (goal for 2025-35).
• FTP will offer a 0 percent import tariff;
• Business taxes will be set at 15 percent (China, as a whole, is 25 percent);
• Individual Income Tax (IIT) would be capped at 15 percent (China, as a whole, is 45 percent);
• Domestic visitors to Hainan will be given an allowance of 100,000 yuan (USD$14,000) worth of duty-free per annum;
• Establish a free flow of capital account (goal for 2025-35).
If managed right, this may create a low-cost location that attracts major investment and innovation. This trial and error enterprise in a small, isolated place will be a good test for the rest of the country, as China is always seeking new paths to growth and its willingness to experiment has been a hallmark of its economic development.
Finally, a double-circulation system
A new concept was proposed at the CPC Politburo Standing Committee meeting on May 14, 2020, and was echoed by Premier Li during the Two Sessions, that China should make full use of its domestic market and potential domestic demand to build a new development model that promotes growth by forming and leveraging a double-circulation system at home and abroad.
A double-circulation development model or growth strategy would require China to remain open to the external world, committed to promoting globalization and willing to cooperate globally in sustaining and further developing international industrial and supply chains. At the same time, China would build domestic industrial clusters to ensure self-reliance for the long term.
Self-reliance becomes critical to prepare for what might be extremely harsh external economic and political challenges if the United States boosts efforts to contain China's development. A White House policy paper released in May 2020 clearly made China a long-term adversary to contain and throttle. So, what option does China have but to respond in a way that leaves multiple avenues open to maneuver?
It is better to integrate and utilize the two avenues for growth: two industrial bases and supply chains, and two markets that can be aligned with the long-term plan for supply side structural reform, and to push the growth of domestic demand. This evolution will be even more significant when China surpasses the US to become the biggest consumption market.
Domestically, the reform will feature total factor marketization, with newly added land and data as key elements. Land and data will now be included as part of market exchanges, according to a document issued by the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and the State Council. The international side of the circulation will face the Global North’s re-shoring and near-shoring changes after COVID-19 brought off-shoring’s disadvantages clearly to light. Though China won’t give up on western markets, the leadership expects to pivot toward the Global South, in conjunction with the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).
Chinese people need a vision grounded in reality pointing the direction for personal financial opportunities. This latest NPC session certainly offered up an audacious new vision. The future is centered on the Hainan FTP, greater YRD integration, and the double circulation as the growth engines of the next round of economic development. There will certainly be the naysayers, as there have been for the past 30 years, and it will be interesting to see how far this ambitious approach will run. As China’s plans, policies, and actions roll out, the rest of the world will have to catch up.
