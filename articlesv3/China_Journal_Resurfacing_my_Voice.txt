### China Journal: Resurfacing my Voice

AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide analyses about leadership in the global economy. In this post, Dr. Doug Guthrie, who is a co-founder of OGL, continues to curate a special series of China Journal entries over the next two weeks as he returns to China for the first time in four years. In this post, Dr. Guthrie recalls how a presentation at the Shanghai American Chamber of Commerce brought out his voice on China.
The whirlwind of meetings, interviews, and discussions have been difficult to keep track of, but a lot of effort has been put into my first appearance at the Shanghai American Chamber of Commerce (AmCham). My OGL colleague Diane Long worked with local entrepreneur, Mike Rosenthal, who is affiliated with AmCham, to host an interview with me, inviting the expat community to one of the many business networking events hosted by this august group. On Dec. 7, Mike interviewed me at an AmCham event.
This interview was important for me and hopefully helpful for the audience. For me, it was sort of my coming out party for my return to China as a China scholar and an expert on U.S.-China relations. This engagement would give me a sense of how deep the concerns are about the tensions between the world’s two largest economies and the world’s two largest trading partners. It would also be a chance for AmCham members to have a chance to discuss openly the questions about the state of the Chinese economy, the state of the U.S. economy, the continued evolution of business and U.S. corporate investment in China, and the import of the Xi-Biden APEC meeting.
The public interview was scheduled to last one hour, but we spent four hours in a pre-interview meeting, prepping for the flow of the interview and outlining my answers to the questions Mike planned to pose. The investment of time was worth it. The event was a great success, which was a bit of an irony given where I am in my life right now.
Having spent the last four years since I was last in China dealing with Bipolar II Disorder, I have returned here with a different kind of energy. For those not familiar, Bipolar II sufferers swing between periods of hypomania – a condition where one displays abnormally elevated levels of mood, energy, self-actualization, etc. – and depression. I have spent my life with this condition, and many people who knew me during my various stints in China almost always interacted with the character I call hypomanic Doug. It was a persona that served me well throughout my career. It was a confident, commanding, fearless version of myself. But hypomanic Doug was also self-destructive. He was an impulsive workaholic, who paid more attention to his work and being a great China scholar than he did to his family and friends. Since my Bipolar II Disorder diagnosis, right after I left China for the last time, I have learned to control hypomanic Doug, only letting him into the room when he was really needed.
As I was preparing for the interview, several people, including the interviewer, seemed concerned. Mike reminded me more than once, “Doug, you know how China audiences are… If they aren’t stimulated and engaged, they will get their phones out and check out of our interview. We need high energy.” Even Diane asked me several times if I was tired or jet lagged.
I felt fine, so I brushed the comments off. And when the moment came, I tiptoed to the back of my brain, flipped the hypomanic Doug switch (this is the imagery I have developed to illustrate when I draw on the energy of the hypomanic side of myself to teach or give a talk). At this stage in my life, I am in control of this energy, and I can shut it down or turn it on when the time comes. After the talk,  there was a funny mix of curiosity and surprise. The audience was extremely happy with the talk, and Mike turned to me and said, “Wow. Doug. That was really good. Where did that guy come from?” I smiled at the comment but kept my imagery of the switch in the back of my brain that turns on hypomanic Doug. “Thanks, Mike. It was a lot of fun.”
As I thought about the interaction afterwards, I realized: This new, more moderated Doug was quieter, calmer, and perhaps, on the surface, seemed low energy. But hypomanic Doug is still in there. I am just in control of when he appears and works his magic. It has been an interesting journey with him, and it has been especially fascinating to bring him out again as I visit China.
