On Global Leadership's feature, OGL Real Time, presents our up-to-the-minute insights on current news and events. We hope these breaking news insights from our OGL team members will help illuminate the events of the day and provide the depth needed to understand global political, economic and cultural transitions and transformations. This Real Time Q&A seeks to further explore how the report from the 20th CPC National Congress illuminates China's future plans for its economy and high-quality economic development.
QUESTION: Recent commentary suggests the 20th CPC National Congress marks the end of China's previous focus on “taking economic construction as the central task (以经济建设为中心)”. There is neither a prescription to solve today's economic issues nor plans for the market in the 20th CPC National Congress Report (20th report). Instead, a chapter on "Modernizing China's National Security System and Capacity and Safeguarding National Security and Social Stability" is emphasized. What does OGL make of this new focus?
OGL: Economic construction has become the consensus of the CPC and the Chinese people that development is the nation’s top priority. Without solid material and technological foundations, China won’t be able to build a great modern country.
Taking economic construction as the central task was initially proposed by Deng Xiaoping in January 1980 (1). In preparation for the change, at the 13th CPC national congress in October 1987, it was established as the basic line for the primary stage of Chinese socialism. It was officially recorded in the CPC Constitution then and has been carried on until today.
The 20th report determines “high-quality economic growth” is the prerequisite for CPC to achieve the centennial goal (2049) “to build a modern socialist country in all respects” as the main task of China's development in the next five years. In the 20th report, “high-quality development”, the term with the characteristics of “the new era”, has replaced “economic construction” as the key phrase here. The 20th report makes references to high-quality development in various ways:
To build a modern socialist country in all respects, we must, first and foremost, pursue high-quality development；Pursuing the high-quality development is one of the essential requirements of Chinese modernization；A main objective for the next five years is to make breakthroughs in promoting high-quality economic development;To accelerate the creation of a new development pattern and pursuing the high-quality development；To ensure officials are becoming more capable of pursuing the high-quality development
• To build a modern socialist country in all respects, we must, first and foremost, pursue high-quality development；
• Pursuing the high-quality development is one of the essential requirements of Chinese modernization；
• A main objective for the next five years is to make breakthroughs in promoting high-quality economic development;
• To accelerate the creation of a new development pattern and pursuing the high-quality development；
• To ensure officials are becoming more capable of pursuing the high-quality development
China's top officials have not shown any signals they plan to neglect economic growth or decouple from the outside world during or after the congress. After officially starting his third term, President Xi Jinping reiterated, in his speech debuting the new top seven leaders on October 23, 2022, that “China's opening door will only get bigger and bigger”.
On October 25, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), together with five other ministries, proposed 15 measures to attract and support foreign investment, including a request to local governments to further clarify their standards and to simplify the procedures for foreigners to come to China. The Civil Aviation Administration of China announced plans to increase international flights, signaling the relaxation of entry restrictions due to COVID-19 precautions.
From a personnel arrangements perspective, although Li Qiang (李强), the next premier candidate, lacks experience in politics of the central government e.g., the State Council, he has a reputation in local business communities for his pragmatic and open-minded style when he served as governor or party chief of Zhejiang, Jiangsu, and Shanghai. Therefore, some people predict that Li Qiang may exert greater influence in promoting the economy because of his close relationship with Xi and his decades of experience managing economic development.
On October 28, 2022, Wang Yi, new CPC political bureau member and Foreign Minister, told U.S. Ambassador to China Nicholas Burns that the United States should stop trying to deal with China from a position of strength, and stop aiming at suppressing and containing China's development. Since neither China nor the United States want a military conflict, "economic strength" will largely be the main competition area, especially in high-tech innovation and supply chain safety.
To summarize, the CPC and the Chinese government know how important the economy is to the people and the country. In order to achieve “the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation”, the economy is the foundation and prerequisite for all work. Development is always the absolute truth (2).
QUESTION: In terms of a new vision for development, the 20th report proposes “to effectively upgrade and appropriately expand China’s economic output” (3). The report of the 19th CPC Congress said, “we must put quality first and give priority to performance”. Why does the 20th report add the statement, “appropriately expand China's economic output”, and how will the "appropriate" level be gauged?
OGL: The purpose of mentioning to “appropriately expand China's economic output” is to remind the party and people that emphasizing high-quality development does not mean to neglect the speed of economy growth. According to the two-step strategic plan, China will significantly increase its economic strength, scientific and technological capabilities, and composite national strengthand substantially grow the per capita GDP to be at par with that of mid-level developed countries by 2035. It is obvious that such a goal cannot be achieved without an adequate pace of growth.
To achieve the goals of 2035, China's economy must cross three hurdles:
Become a high-income country. In 2021, the per capita GDP of China was US$12,556, very close to US$12,695, which is the threshold for high-income countries set by the World Bank. China first set the goal to become a high-income country during the 14th Five-Year Plan period (2021-2025). If China succeeds, the number of people living in high-income countries will double to more than 30 percent of the world's population.Become the world's largest economy. This could be even more impactful than GDP growth. In terms of purchasing power parity (PPP), China's GDP surpassed that of the U.S. in 2016. But according to market rates, China's economy in 2021 is 77% of the size of the United States'. In 2022, considering the depreciation of the Renminbi against the dollar and its lower-than-expected economic growth, China's GDP is likely to fall to about 70% of the United States' GDP. If China could sustain an average annual GDP growth rate at 3% higher than that of the U.S., we estimate that China would likely become the largest economy in the period between 2029 and 2033. Of course, some believe this will not happen even by 2060 because China will no longer be on right track for that growth. For years to come, the comparison between the two economies will continue.Become a mid-level developed country by 2035. This will require the average GDP of China to achieve 22,000~23,000 U.S. dollars (calculated at U.S. dollar exchange rate in 2020). That means the living standard for the average Chinese person in 2035 will be same as that of people living in Jiangsu Province in 2021. China's leading economist Justin Lin estimated that China needs to grow its economy at an average 4.7% until 2035 to reach this level.
• Become a high-income country. In 2021, the per capita GDP of China was US$12,556, very close to US$12,695, which is the threshold for high-income countries set by the World Bank. China first set the goal to become a high-income country during the 14th Five-Year Plan period (2021-2025). If China succeeds, the number of people living in high-income countries will double to more than 30 percent of the world's population.
• Become the world's largest economy. This could be even more impactful than GDP growth. In terms of purchasing power parity (PPP), China's GDP surpassed that of the U.S. in 2016.

If China could sustain an average annual GDP growth rate at 3% higher than that of the U.S., we estimate that China would likely become the largest economy in the period between 2029 and 2033. Of course, some believe this will not happen even by 2060 because China will no longer be on right track for that growth. For years to come, the comparison between the two economies will continue.
• Become a mid-level developed country by 2035. This will require the average GDP of China to achieve 22,000~23,000 U.S. dollars (calculated at U.S. dollar exchange rate in 2020).

China's leading economist Justin Lin estimated that China needs to grow its economy at an average 4.7% until 2035 to reach this level.
We understand that China is facing many challenges: its growth has been hampered by its zero-COVID policy, its slumping real estate market, a stagnant stock market, incomplete reform of its state-owned enterprises, its aging population, and a continuing tech war with the United States. It is very likely China's GDP growth rate for 2022 will be around 3.5%, far below the 5.5% target set in March 2022. At present, the biggest challenge for China's economy is the lack of confidence. People will watch carefully to see how the new leadership team will restore the confidence of consumers and entrepreneurs, especially in terms of how to balance COVID-19 prevention and economic and social development.
