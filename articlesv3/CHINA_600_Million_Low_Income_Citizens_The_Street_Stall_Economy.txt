### CHINA: 600 Million Low-Income Citizens; The Street-Stall Economy

18 June 2020|China
AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy and, in particular, life in China. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. We are building an economic database of cities in China to better understand how jurisdictions cope with today’s economic and political forces, as well. We have sought to advance a conversation about what leadership in these times of crisis might look like. In this post, we provide additional insights into our views about the National People’s Congress (NPC) on May 22. – The Editorial Team

600 Million People with Monthly Disposable Income Barely 1000 Yuan ($141)
Following tradition, Premier Li Keqiang held a press conference on the last day (May 28) of the postponed NPC session this year. A total of 11 reporters were selected to ask questions, only four were from media outlets in mainland China (the lowest ratio ever in the history of premier’s press conference). Six out of 11 questions related to China’s domestic economy, society, and livelihood, which allowed the premier to highlight the country’s desire to focus on the importance of internal affairs in the midst of the crisis. In addition to the government’s decision to back away from GDP growth as a measure of the country’s economic health – a point we have discussed in an earlierpost–Li’s comments about poverty had much greater reverberation around the country. As Li pointedly put it: “There are still some 600 million people… [where] their monthly income is barely 1,000 yuan.” In the eyes of many Chinese netizens, the fact that 600 million people only earn about 1,000 yuan [USD141] a month is incredible, if not unthinkable.
Why does this matter? President Xi and Li seem to be aggressively highlighting the poverty levels in China (based on very conservative statistics, see below) in order to focus the country’s attention on continued economic development. (This reminds us, by ironic contrast, of a U.S. president who, in the midst of multiple crises, continues to talk about the “wonderful” economy and the surging Dow Jones.) China’s approach reminds the country that the dominant focus is on economic development and poverty alleviation. For further context, we quote here directly from Li’s press conference:
“This year, China plans to win its battle against poverty. But because of COVID-19, many families have seen a decline in their household income. And some are even at the risk of falling back into poverty. So, are we able to fulfill the task of winning the battle against poverty this year? And what will the government do to meet people's essential needs?” Li said, according to People’s Daily. CG: This is a translation of the question asked by People’s Daily, the following paragraph is Li’s answer.
“Our country is a developing country with a big population. The per capita annual disposable income in China is 30,000 RMB yuan [USD4,231]. But there are still some 600 million people earning a medium or low income, or even less. Their monthly income is barely 1,000 yuan. It's not even enough to rent a room in a medium Chinese city. And because of COVID-19, many families have encountered difficulties. So, it is a very high priority on the government's work agenda to meet the essential needs of vulnerable groups and those families who have encountered new difficulties because of COVID-19. This is a very important part of the government's work agenda. And a fairly big part of our support policies is designed for this very purpose.”
“This year, we are determined to end poverty as scheduled. This is a serious commitment made by the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core to the whole of Chinese society. Before COVID-19 struck, there were some 5 million people living below the poverty line. But because of the disease, some may have fallen back into poverty. Hence, we now face a greater task in meeting our goal. But with our multi-pronged policies and measures to ensure the essential needs of our people, we have the confidence to win the battle against poverty this year.”
Many Chinese people had a difficult time believing that the country is still that poor. Indeed, President Xi himself often boasts about the 500 million people that have been lifted out of poverty as a result of the government’s policies in the Reform Era. The World Bank reports that poverty rates in China fell from over 80 percent in 1981 to less than 1 percent today. (The World Bank defines “extreme poverty” as living on less than $1.90 per day.) Further, China now sits securely as the second largest economy in the world, and it will likely surpass the United States as the world’s largest economy in the next three to four years. Chinese citizens travel the globe sweeping up luxury goods from many tourist destinations around the world. In some first-tier Chinese cities, potential property buyers are not allowed to view properties unless they can show proof of multi-million-yuan deposits in Chinese banks. There are many other markers illustrating that the country has left its impoverished and painful past behind. Thus, in the eyes of many Chinese netizens, the fact that “600 million people only earn about 1,000 yuan a month” is incredible if not unthinkable.
How should we interpret Li's “China has 600 million people with monthly income barely 1000 yuan”?
First, we should clarify that the concept of income Li mentions refers to residents’disposable income, not income from wages and salaries. China’s National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) notes thatdisposable income of households(DIH) refers to the actual income at the disposal of members of the household—money that can be used for final consumption, other non-compulsory expenditures, and savings. (DIH equals total household income minus income tax minus personal contribution to social security.) Second, per capita income is determined by household disposable income divided by the number of persons per household, which includes the employed and unemployed members.
The data on income, expenditures, and living conditions for the urban and rural households are collected from a household-level survey conducted by NBS since the fourth quarter of 2012. The survey methodology mirrors the Current Population Survey conducted in the United States. NBS selects sample houses randomly, with all households in a given province as the population, with stratified, multi-stage, probability sampling. Some 160,000 households are keep detailed economic diaries. NBS notes all survey research is conducted through face-to-face interviews by an in-house investigative team. Coding, checking, and the entering of original data are conducted by investigative teams at the city level, as well, with the same methods and data processing programming. Processed data are transferred directly to NBS to assemble the overall data set.

The latest NBS data show that the average per capitadisposableincome of residents in China in 2019 is 30,733 yuan (Table 1) The monthly average per capita disposable income is 2,561 yuan. This is where “the per capita annual disposable income in China is 30,000 yuan” in Li’s answer comes from. The lower-middle-income households and the lower-income households, which account for 40 percent of national households, have an average annual income of 11,578.5 yuan (Table 2), just within the range of “around 1,000 yuan per month”. Many outlets use a headline such as “Income of 600 Million People Below1,000 Yuan” to generate attention, including Caixin, a well-known political and economic media outlet. That understanding is not in line with the premier's words.

China has a population of 1.4 billion people. How do 40 percent of households account for 600 million people? The answer lies in family size. In China, not surprisingly, data at the provincial level show that per capita disposable income and family size are inversely related. Using NBS data, provinces/municipalities with the highest per capita disposable income had, on average, 2.71 persons per household, while the bottom five jurisdictions had an average family size of 3.43(Table 3). Because lower income households tend to have bigger family sizes, the population of the bottom 40 percent of households is estimated at around 600 million – the latest figure from NBS is 610 million

NBS also provides per capita disposable income of urban and rural households by income quintile. The latest data available are from 2018. Further analysis shows that the 600 million includes close to 60 percent of the rural households and 20 percent of the urban households. They are labeled the low-income people in Chinese society.

Li’s data didn’t come as a surprise. The data were released by NBS a few months ago, and therefore not considered “shocking secrets.” The message is clear: China is the second largest economy in the world,andit has about 600 million people whose monthly income is around 1000 yuan. Top Chinese leaders understand China’s complexity where developments and backwardness coexist. Li’s directness can help the Chinese people better understand the nation’s challenges and difficulties in achieving development goals. The interesting point here is that Xi and Li are clearly trying to signal how important the antipoverty campaign is to them. Rather than taking up airtime talking about the strength of the Chinese economy, they are emphasizing, by citing the most conservative statistical measures, how far China still has to go.
Soon after China’s “Two Sessions”(NPC and CPPCC) ended, the concept of the “Street-stall Economy”(地摊经济) became an instant hit. The fad is symbolized by a mini truck produced by General Motors' joint venture in China. This cyber star is called "Yi Kai Qi"(翼开启). “翼” means “wing,” also same pronunciation as “易” which means “easy” in Chinese, “开启” means “open”. “Wing to open” reflects a key feature of this popular model, three sides of its carriage are specially designed to be fully opened like wings. “Wing to Open” belongs to “Wuling Glory”(五菱荣光), a best-selling line of SAIC-GM-Wuling (SGMW), the joint venture GM has in South China. Fifteen feet in length,7.42 feet in height, with 187-cubic-feet cargo space and sold for 55,800 yuan (USD7,800), “Wing to open” has been praised by netizens as the “Magic Stall Car.”

Perhaps due to the deterioration of the US-China relationship, SGMW only appears as a low-profile chassis provider for “Wing to open.” On SGMW website, you can find the following introduction: “SAIC-GM-Wuling Automobile Co., Ltd. (SAIC-GM-Wuling) is a joint venture that was founded on November 18, 2002. GM China has a 44.0 percent stake, SAIC a 50.1 percent stake and Guangxi Automobile Group Co. Ltd. (the former Wuling Motors) a 5.9 percent stake. SAIC-GM-Wuling is based in Liuzhou, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, in southwestern China. It also has manufacturing bases in Qingdao, Shandong, and Chongqing Municipality. The joint venture manufactures a range of Wuling brand mini-trucks and minivans as well as a growing family of Baojun passenger vehicles.”
SGMW mainly targets the low-end market and is the largest auto manufacturer in China. On May 25, 2020, SGMW announced it had become the first Chinese automaker to exceed 22 million units in production. Seven years after SGMW was established, “Wuling Sunshine” (五菱宏光) MPV became ubiquitous in China as a total of 597,000 units were sold in 2009. In April 2010, “Wuling Sunshine” appeared on the cover page ofForbes– “The Most Important Car on Earth, Can China’s Wuling Sunshine Save GM?” In the same year, SGMW launched “Wuling Glory,” which is a passenger and cargo dual-use car that was later known as “The Domestic Car” in China, and its sales volume has ranked it No. 1 in the country for 24 consecutive months.
TheForbesarticle noted: “In the U.S. and Europe, GM may or may not succeed in making cars that consumers want. In China, it is producing exactly what customers need: cheap transportation.” There is a saying in automobile circles, Wuling promotes the prosperity of small- and medium-sized enterprises, Wuling vehicles are the tools making grassroots rich. Whether you carry passengers or transport cargos, you do decoration or run a stall, Wuling always has a role to play. SGMW has extremely high market sensitivity, they make whatever the market needs. After the epidemic broke out, SGMW began to make masks, thus greatly improved its brand favorability among consumers. "Wing to open" is another good example of SGMW’s meticulous consideration for users. Each side of its carriage has two pieces of baffle, the upper piece can form a canopy and the lower piece becomes a shelf. What a “Magic Stall Car”

Street-stall Economy
In China, the street-stall economy has existed for thousands of years, surviving dynasty changes and business ups and downs. Liu Bei（刘备), the monarch of the Shu Han Dynasty, (蜀汉) during the Three Kingdoms (三国) period, is said to have sold straw mats on the streets. In a renowned painting, “Along the River During the Qingming Festival” (清明上河图), peddlers are vividly depicted on the street of Kaifeng (开封), capital of the North Song Dynasty(北宋) in 960 AD—1127AD.
After the reforms and opening of China in 1978, the street-stall economy spread all over the country and attracted big businesses such as Yiwu Small Commodity City, a market with annual sales of over 450 billion yuan (USD63 billion). However, since 2008, many cities have regarded the “city image” as an important KPI. The fever to create civilized and sanitary cities threatens the street-stall economy, which has become synonymous with disorder, dirt, and a low-end economy. Every day, peddlers worried about being banned and chased, playing the game of “cat and mouse” with Chenguan (城管urban management ). Although the street-stall economy has many problems such as hindering traffic, creating pollution and noise, poor product quality, etc., a city without peddlers lacks vitality.

Adversity leads to change, change leads to solutions. To revive the Chinese economy that has been severely disrupted by the pandemic, the Chinese government vows to ensure security in jobs, basic living needs, operations of market entities, food and energy security, stable industrial and supply chains, and the normal functioning of primary-level governments. The street-stall economy reflects the lowest cost entrepreneurship, and yet it provides a source of income for disadvantaged groups. Such spontaneous self- employment has to some extent alleviated unemployment pressure. In the eyes of most Chinese people, peddlers are due more respect than those who complain all the time and want to get something for nothing.

There are still some 600 million low-income people in China. These people may not go to a large shopping mall to buy a few hundred bucks of clothing, but they will be happy to buy something affordable from a stall. They may be reluctant to spend two or three hundred to eat in a restaurant, but in their spare time they will entertain themselves with kebabs or oden for less than 10 yuan. One should not underestimate the their consumption power once the desires of 600 million low-income people are stimulated. If each of them spends 5 yuan more a week, the additional spending will total some USD22 billion in a single year.
Working hard to pave a path for small businesses, Li understands the importance of the street-stall economy. “One may recall when young people returned to the cities from the countryside in large numbers in the early days of reform and opening-up, the opening of roadside tea stands helped to put many of them to work. About two weeks ago, I saw in the news that a city in China’s western region, in keeping with local rules and regulations, set up 36,000 mobile stalls, adding some 100,000 new jobs overnight.” Li said in the press conference of the third session of the 13th NPC on May 28. The city winning Li’s praise was Chengdu(成都), capital of Sichuan (四川) province. Chengdu lifted the restrictions on street stalls in March 2020, the first in major city in China. Four days after the press conference, during an inspection trip to Shandong province, Li assured small business owners that his government understands they are important sources of job creation and will provide them more support. Small businesses are as much sources of vitality for the country as are China’s high-end industries. With the endorsement from the Premier, the street-stall economy is rehabilitating. Chengdu, Zhengzhou, Wuhan, Qingdao, and Shanghai—cities across the country have subsequently lifted their bans on street-stalls.

The recovery of the street-stall economy reflects the Chinese government’s pragmatic approach in the face of economic difficulties or a motto of the party“ seeking truth from facts” (实事求是). On May 27, 2020, the Civilization Office of the Central Communist Party Committee made clear to exclude road management, street markets, and mobile vendors as an evaluation criteria of civilized cities. We hope this is a change in the mindset of city administrators. We also hope that such measures are not for short-term emergency purpose, but for the benefits of ordinary people in a post-COVID-19 China. Cities in China should be warmer and more tolerant.
Making 600 million low-income people richer is not something achievable overnight. The street-stall economy may be a good supplement, but it is definitely not the mainstream of the economy. China's economic development should primarily depend on deepening reform and opening up, technological innovation, and taking advantage of the country’s ultra-large-scale market and the huge potential for domestic demands.
