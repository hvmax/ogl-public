### China and COVID-19: The Current State of Things

25 September 2020|China, Coronavirus, Public Health
AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy and, in particular, life in China. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. We are also building a database of cities in China, and we are engaged in a major project on China’s Belt and Road Initiative. Our in-depth research focuses on places that are crucial to Chinese economic development but are off the beaten path, far from where most foreign investors congregate (i.e., Shanghai, Beijing, Shenzhen, Guangzhou). We have written several essays analyzing China’s progress in dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic over the last seven months, and this continues that work. – The Editorial Team.

On August 27, 2020, with the resignation of Dr. Cai Li, the party chief of the Central Hospital of Wuhan, a chapter in the COVID-19 saga has closed. Party chief Cai’s hospital was where the whistle blower, Dr. Li Wen Liang, and the whistle giver, Dr. Ai Fen, worked when the COVID-19 pandemic broke. Back in the first days of January 2020, both Dr. Li and Dr. Ai were given harsh warnings against discussing the pneumonia caused by an unknown virus they had raised concerns about. They were also warned not to wear masks to avoid causing a panic as a rush of patients with pneumonia-like symptoms began to overwhelm all the hospitals in the city. (Oddly enough, as we have learned from the revelations emerging from Bob Woodward’s book,Rage, this was exactly the same response from President Trump  when the disease first entered the United States.)
Recently, the cities of Beijing and Shenzhen passed ordinances, independently of each other, on "Contingency Public Health Emergency Rules" that specifically call for protecting whistleblowers by stating that no one will be held responsible for the spreading of non-malicious, incorrect claims. Furthermore, emergency personnel will be allowed to report to skip-level management.
An Evolving Story
Things had begun to return to normal in China in July as life took on a predictable rhythm. Temples and churches resumed liturgies while parishioners, who had registered for passes, sat in pre-assigned spots identified by stickers. No singing allowed! One Catholic Church had a white robed elder spray sanitizer into the palms of the parishioners as they walked to the altar to receive Communion. By September, all schools were starting their fall semesters on time and in person. It’s been two weeks now and no flare-ups have been reported.
Domestic flights resumed to 80% in the month of August compared to last year. South Korea’s budget airline T’way Air landed in Wuhan on September 15, as the first international flight to land in the city since its abrupt lockdown in January. Sports resumed operations. Chinese soccer leagues announced trial openings to begin tournaments, though tickets for only 17% of seats to the seats were sold. Movie theaters also reopened and were only allowed to fill 75% of their seats.
As each area of society reopens, the expectations remain that within transportation systems like subways and buses, face masks are still required and social distancing is expected. One is conscious in a crowd, even outdoors, that most people continue to wear masks out of an abundance of caution. With no current domestic outbreaks and a tight fist on the inbound traffic, the question could well be asked if China could further loosen controls now that life seems to be back to normal.
At present in China, as is the case around the world, the focus is on finding a vaccine. There are five scientific approaches in process for the research and development of the COVID-19 vaccines. These include inactivated vaccine, attenuated vaccine, genetically engineered vaccine, virus vector vaccine, and nucleic acid vaccine (mRNA and DNA). Each of the five technologies has its own advantages and disadvantages. The safety of the quick-effect vaccines is not guaranteed, and the long-lasting ones are more likely to be prohibitively expensive.
The Ministry of Science and Technology and the National Health Commission of China have taken the lead in organizing joint research teams to carry out simultaneous research and development of the vaccines for all five categories, hoping to maximize the success rate. So far, three streams of two types of inactivated vaccines and virus vectors have entered the third phase of clinical trials and have been approved for use by specific population groups. Under these clinical trial programs, more than 200,000 people have been vaccinated in China.
Various Resurgences
Daily reports come in via news and social media outlets updating the nation on the situation on new cases. Since outbreaks in Dalian and Xinjiang have recently been brought under control, all new cases being identified seem to be imported from abroad. As more and more flights are approved, and China issues more visas, the chance for imported cases to slip through the dragnet at the various international airports across the country rises. Three of the most recent outbreaks and their resolution include:
· Beijing, June 11 to August 6: 335 cases (no deaths); 12 apartment housing compounds locked down; traffic blocked off in some districts; widespread nucleic acid testing (10,414,000 tests in first 12 days); no new cases after the twenty-sixth day; three district officials were punished for neglecting their duty.
· Xinjiang (Urumqi city), July 15 to September 7: 1,064 cases (no deaths); Urumqi city closed off to the outside; first week nucleic acid test 2,309,537.
· Dalian, July 22 to August 28: 118 cases, including 26 asymptomatic cases (no deaths); several areas closed off and housing compounds locked down; about 7,500,000 nucleic acid tests given throughout the city.
Case Study: Dalian
After more than 100 days without a new case, Dalian, a major port city in the northeast, reported a new local case on July 22. The patient was a worker in a seafood process company. By August 3, there were 92 newly confirmed local cases and 26 asymptomatic cases in Dalian. Medical teams from other locales around China who had experience with COVID-19 were sent to support the hospitals in Dalian. Yet the surge was cleared by August 28.
How was it possible? In response to the reemergence of the epidemic in Dalian, the municipal government took the following decisive measures:
· Limited access to blocks on the streets where the coronavirus cases were found as well as stopped the public transportation services within and around those areas.
· Plotted movement maps of those confirmed cases and released the maps to the public for self-tracing.
· Instituted mass nucleic acid tests the day the first case was confirmed on July 22, in the area where the outbreak was first found. Four days later, testing continued with residents in the main city area, followed by expanded testing in the suburban counties within 10 days. (Dalian has a population of about 6.5 million and more than 80% of them were tested within the 10 days.)
Dalian’s efforts on testing began at the front door of those who could not leave their homes and eventually spread to some 7.5 million people. Over a little more than a month, the government was able to complete large-scale nucleic acid tests by adopting creative “5-in-1” or “10-in-1” mixed sampling protocols. Rapid and large-scale nucleic acid tests were designed to control the spread in a community by identifying the infected residences quickly. Among the 92 confirmed cases, 52 cases were asymptomatic and later developed into confirmed cases.
A preliminary positive was reported within 12 hours, with the final test results obtained within 24 hours. For example, at about 12:00 noon on July 30, a preliminary report showed that there was a suspected positive in a mixed 5-in-1 sample. After confirming the list of five persons with a total of 10 related family members, a temporary quarantine was imposed on their living areas and the second sampling was carried out.
At 22:30 on July 30, the results of the second sampling were negative, and the temporary control was lifted. Meanwhile, among the 10 family members, one member worked in the Central Avenue Shopping Plaza and could potentially become a super spreader. The shopping plaza district underwent a temporary freeze of movement for all the personnel who worked there. The public health staff started performing screenings at the contact level until the temporary control was lifted.
Meanwhile, effective July 25, all independent clinics and outpatient services were ordered to stop operations. They were not allowed to resume normal operations until Aug. 19. The Dalian government covered all the medical costs of the confirmed and suspected patients. Individuals do not bear the cost of treatment in China. The cost of nucleic acid test is borne by the government as well. Five residents were discovered to have violated the closed off management measures. Four of them had gathered together to play cards, and one tried to evade capture by climbing over a wall. All five were detained for five days for punishment and observation.
Through epidemiological investigation, Dalian found that the epidemic likely started at the seafood processing workshop of the Kaiyang Company and spread outward from there. A total of 60 workers and managers were infected in the workshop, at the rate of 61.9%. The epidemic characteristics suggest that the frozen seafood process situation is conducive to the spread of the coronavirus. As a prevention mechanism, the Dalian municipal government has stipulated that every batch of imported seafood products should be tested for the coronavirus, and workers should be tested once every two weeks, and environmental sampling testing should be carried out every week in the operation sites. As of September 7, 2020, China Customs suspended licenses for 56 frozen seafood exporters from 19 countries for which the coronavirus was detected. Among them, 41 companies volunteered to suspend the shipments.
Some might consider China’s top-down measures “draconian”, but the Chinese government uses them to effectively deal with the resurgences. But they aren’t the only ones effectively mastering resurgences? South Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam, Japan as well as Singapore have found their own solutions. Asian peoples in all these countries have a strong sense of shared purpose and responsibility to the community. They support the measures and follow the rules. People might complain about the inconvenience, but they feel safe and taken care of.
The question being discussed on the ground in China is the necessity of such strong armed measures? As the second wave was held at bay it appears the government is using “a sledgehammer to kill a gnat” and the critics are asking. Or are these comments coming from the so called “wise men after an event” (杀鸡用牛刀 事后诸葛亮). As the Chinese world has more or less gone back to normal, one must appreciate the atmosphere of safety as we go about our daily lives. The three weapons in the arsenal, used repeatedly day in and day out are: mask, distance, and hygiene. It appears that perhaps the tool most important is persistence.
