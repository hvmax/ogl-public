### Storytelling & the Systems Leader, Part 2: Selfmaking & Culture

In the previous post in this series, we argued that the storytelling of Systems Leaders drives and shapes the sensemaking and solutionmaking of teams and organizations. To understand how stories also drive and shape those leaders themselves and enable them to communicate more authentically and effectively with others, we turn here to explore storytelling and its role in selfmaking and cultures. - The OGL Editorial Team

If living stories of teams and organizations contain essential truths yet continue to be open to change wrought by interactions with situations and relationships among people, the same can be said for the individual stories of leaders and other persons. This is more than a parallel between storytelling on the different levels of collective and individual experience. In fact, as educational psychologist Isabela Granic argues,an individual’s “narrative identity” is shaped by factors drawn concurrently from multiple levels of experience and stories(2020). These include narratives of “agency,” “communion,” and “coherence” at the intra-personal level; the “elaboration,” “attentive listening,” and “grappling contradictions” of interpersonal storytelling; and the “person-society integration,” “master narratives,” and “alternative narratives” of culture. Her narrative-based model of identity development positsselfmaking, as we have called it in this series, as an ongoing set of interdependent processes occurring across contexts.
While telling stories is an important ability and practice of leaders, and sits at the heart of the essential leadership practice of communication, it can also be challenging for some leaders (Baldoni 2003;Denning 2011). Common barriers that may prevent people from telling stories include the fear that they don’t have any stories to share, or not feeling comfortable in telling personal stories. Sharing a story can be risky since some stories could fail and reduce the credibility of the leader in the process. Yet, leaders who know how to reflect on their life experiences in order to identify stories that shaped who they are today can develop and use that increased ability to communicate more authentically and ethically with others (Auvinen, Lämsä, Sintonen, and Takala 2013). Learning where to find stories, creating their own leadership stories, matching their stories to a purpose, and practicing storytelling techniques can allow leaders to be more effective communicators and enablers of shared work.
To craft and employ stories that drive more effective leadership requires sensitivity to specific situations and organizations. InThe Leader’s Guide to Storytelling,former World Bank Knowledge Management Director Stephen Denning suggests how particular narrative patterns can help leaders to better use storytelling to motivate others and to achieve organizational goals. To deliver a leadership message with purpose, Denning describes stories that follow one of eight patterns: a) motivate others to action; b) build trust; c) build the brand; d) transmit values; e) get others to work together; f) share knowledge; g) tame the grapevine; and h) lead people into the future. These narrative patterns help leaders to match a story to their own communication or leadership objectives and provide tips on how to tell their stories and possible ways those stories may be received by the audience. Leaders who understand how to use the story patterns may reduce the risk of telling what may be a good story, but sharing it at the wrong time and with the wrong audience.
Inthe previous entry in this series onSelfmaking, we did not use the common, complex, and often politically charged word,Identity, when discussing how leaders’ selves evolved. Yet as psychologists Howard E. Gardner and Emma Laskin observed in their study of “leading minds,”“it is stories of identity—narratives that help individuals think about and feel who they are, where they come from, and where they are headed—that constitute the single most powerful weapon in the leader’s literary arsenal” (2011: 117-118). Put differently, like other persons, products, organizations, and events, stories lend texture and dimension to our understanding, particularly in temporal terms, of past determinants or causes and future tendencies or possibilities. That understanding is weapon-like, for Gardner and Laskin, because it can be deployed to support or even model an individual’s or a firm’s strategic intent.
The choice of martial vocabulary about narrative storytelling -- “the most powerful weapon in the leader’s literary arsenal” -- merits further comment. In their conclusion, Gardner and Laskin note that “the moral dimension of leadership” is one of the questions raised by their study. While the majority of the eleven leaders profiled in the book are “inclusionary” and “prosocial,” their guiding features and “constants” of leadership are more value-neutral. In particular, the central story or message of a leader -- about identity, other essential questions, specific domains relevant to them -- need not be beneficent. The self-consciousness of many leaders about their own stories as leadership stories can potentially be cast in quite different terms, as they allow when mentioning that two immensely influential tracts about leadership were written by Machiavelli and Hitler. Storytelling as a weapon thus emphasizes how storytelling is a central tool for leaders not only to influence others but also to frame and design their own identities.
To be precise, these processes of framing (sensemaking) and designing (solutionmaking) are ongoing. In part, as we have asserted this series, using the notion of theLeader-Symboland building on Erving Goffman’s seminal work on the presentation of self,leadership narratives are part of the leader’s continuing ‘stage management’ of self-understanding and others’ impressions. Practically, individual stories are bases of self-development. In their 2005 article, “What’s Your Story?”, leadership scholar Herminia Ibarra and consultant Kent Lineback made clear how a narrative understanding of oneself enables the leader’s adaptation, learning, and growth: “For it is in a period of change that we often fail, yet most need, to link our past, present, and future into a compelling whole.” Leader’s stories are “living stories,” in other words, and combine the continuous cycle of understanding their current self and situation and also then of re-making that self and situation. Rather than occurring in isolation, this cycle for leaders co-evolves with the wider team or organizational dynamic of sensemaking and solutionmaking.
While stories are often essential to various approaches to understanding and practicing leadership, they have special purchase in discussions of authentic leadership. Consider two examples. Former Medtronic CEO and Harvard Business School Professor Bill George has long championedthe benefits of leaders’ embracing their life stories, particularly those of “crucible moments”of personal testing and pivoting, as grounding for deeper self-understanding and more authentic decision-making and relationship-building. Alternatively, Olin Business School scholar Raymond Sparrowe argues that “authenticity is not achieved by self-awareness of one's inner values or purpose, but instead is emergent from the narrative process in which others play a constitutive role in the self” (2005: 419). In other words, the narrative process of selfmaking, animated by relationships with others, becomes the basis for an ongoing and evolving process ofauthentication.While still potentially a weapon for leaders, living stories in Sparrowe’s view are less the result of a single leader’s guile or imagination than of dynamic and interdependent leadership systems.
This series began by contrasting the traditional focus on individual leaders and a systems-guided view of more collective leadership. In everyday thinking and, as one of us (David) has previously written, in popular culture,greater attention continues to be paid to CEO or other individual performance and succession than to leadership teamsof two or more. When complementary teams can be advantageous, how they should be designed, and what happens when their membership changes are less frequent topics. These tendencies are reinforced in conventional leadership and organizational storytelling. From movies to business cases to corporate press releases, it is more difficult to expand our narrative focus beyond the single, familiar, often male, larger-than-life, heroic, and unitary protagonist leader -- for example, toaccounts of complementary teams, whose diverse members and different strengths and styles can generate great benefits in creativity and productivity.
Our acculturation to specific patterns of leadership narratives emerges from both storiesaboutindividual leaders and stories toldbymany of these leaders. As noted above, refining the skills of storytelling is critical to many leaders. InAnimal Spirits, which argues that humans are hard-wired to organize information and experience into narratives, Nobel Laureates George Akerlof and Robert J. Shiller go further, asserting that, “Great leaders are foremost creators of stories” (2009: 51). In teams and organizations, leaders are often the creators, yes, but they are also evangelists, translators, exemplars, and finally guardians of the central foundations, shared meanings, and collective aspirations organized into and relayed through stories. In taking on and often (re-)making those various roles around stories, leaders themselves co-evolve with their teams or organizations and the actions they take together.
Stories and Systems: The Power of Culture
Business and leadership narratives are often defined by specific, linear, and short-term outcomes. Complex, open-ended, and longer-term stories with adaptable elements are not as compelling to many popular and corporate audiences. Yet as scholars have begun to recognize, organizations can employ both types of stories depending on their goals, situations, and other variables.Robert Akerlof, Niko Matouschek, and Luis Rayo, for example, draw a contrast between narratives based in their relationship to given situations and those based in their meaning to workers.
A ‘purpose-driven’ organization pairs flat monetary incentives with a story that emphasizes the importance of generating output (e.g., saving lives, putting a person on the moon). The second one, which we call an ‘incentive-driven’ organization, pairs steep monetary incentives with a narrower story that emphasizes the importance of maintaining ethical standards (e.g., maintaining quality, helping peers). Which design is optimal depends on the severity of multitasking and the relative costs of conveying different types of stories (2020: 200).
More precisely, it is often the coordination of these contrasting narratives that is best suited to organizations responding to specific situations and anticipating future scenarios. That should not be viewed as a concession or undesirable accommodation to traditional incentives, like firm revenues or profit or individual compensation.
InLetting Stories Breathe, sociologist Arthur W. Frank underscores some more fundamental stakes of storytelling. “Human life depends on the stories we tell,” he asserts, through “the sense of self those stories impart, the relationships constructed around shared stories, and the sense of purpose that stories both propose and foreclose” (2010: 3). Like the outcomes of Granic’s empirical research, Frank’s argument emphasizes the linkages provided by stories among multiple layers of leadership and life. Qualifying his title, in fact, Frank notes that while “stories may not actually breathe...they can animate” individuals and groups, effecting change and forming connections among different aspects of life. More specifically, both approaches to narrative depend on three interdependent layers ofactivemeaning-making: of the self or narrative identity, the interpersonal relationships shaped by story telling and listening, and the wider cultural dimension constituted by individual-social interactions and shared narratives.
The last dimension turns on what has famously been calledone of the most complicated words in the English language, “culture.”After making that claim, English critic Raymond Williams went on to explore the history and development of the term and foregrounded the caution to be exercised in generalizing claims about culture in different contexts -- for example, in organizational settings and in nations, societies or other large social groups. A commonality he identifies across the various meanings and usages is that culture has persisted in being a noun of process and “habituation.” As such, like the “living stories” and the ongoing selfmaking that constitute it, culture is ever-changing.
Discussing how narratives transcend and connect different levels of experience -- self, relationships with others, organizational and environmental interactions -- requires that we acknowledge how the seemingly same stories apply to very different actors and groups. In reality, of course, different individuals and groups will interpret the same stories in diverse ways, according to their own perceptions, biases, experiences, and interests. Yet beyond these distinct ways of understanding, it is necessary to look more generally at how individuals engage stories. That is, we do well to appreciate that what often guides individual or group engagement are not only potentially compelling or resonant elements of a story butbeliefsin the validity and relevance of that story to their lives, work, and leadership. For diverse members of a group, effective collaboration and shared behaviors have roots both in finding or making shared meanings in a given story and in believing in their ongoing affinity or “kinship of spirit.”
The interrelation of belief and meaning-making parallel the ways in which cognitive scientists now understand that the brain continually re-makes memories. Typically relying on narrative forms, repeating the recollection and re-telling of memories has the result of re-writing stories of the past. For leaders, framing the past and establishing the core elements of the present are aspects of making meaning that allow teams and organizations to come together with some coherent sense of values and views of the world, themselves, markets, and more. Leaders also need to envision what may come next by producing stories of the future that others not only acknowledge as possible but attach theirbeliefto as a basis of commitment and action. While necessarily incomplete, these scenarios become the basis for diverse individuals to approach in distinctive but still connected ways -- engineers and marketing teams, for instance, might understand and embrace a strategic plan to launch a new product for very different reasons.
Writing about the convergence of knowledge, stories, and culture, management researchers Robert Gibbons and Laurence Prusak conclude, “If organizational culture involves (it would be redundant to say ‘shared’) interpretation, and if interpretation depends on tacit knowledge, and if a good story can leverage or transfer tacit knowledge, then stories may play a role in building organizational culture” (2020: 190). Gibbons and Prusak’s acts of interpretation are central to the meaning-making work of leaders (and authors and historians and politicians). A specific activity of interpretation and meaning-making that we have described for Systems Leaders is reframing, which often entails re-shaping events of the past or current knowledge and information into different stories. Yet the story-making that turns on re-framing is obviously not only the purview of the individual leader or even collective leadership: organizational cultures are dynamic and can themselves frame and re-frame events and information.
Consider how a business or even a team, say in sales or marketing, regularly selects and incorporates elements from market or political developments to accord with and perhaps evolve the stories they use to explain, justify, and motivate their activities. Some of these stories are formal, assembled and crafted for different audiences, like their organizational leadership or their clients. Other stories are more informal, relayed conversationally and sustained as parts of the ongoing routines of the group. Together these stories help to constitute organizational cultures which, as a result, are living entities whose shape and coherence adapt and change over time. For leaders and others, the resulting protean quality of story-shaped cultures can present a challenge for those seeking to specify which stories have priority for groups and how those stories align (or don’t) with organizational goals, priorities, and behaviors. If culture change is a persistent challenge for leaders, at least part of the reason is that the stories and beliefs about them shared by workers are often immensely difficult to revise deliberately.
Often, the difficulty resides in the deep roots and broad reach of the stories themselves. While it may appear straightforward to identify and parse the major structural elements of organizational and cultural narratives -- protagonists, key motivations and actions, obstacles to be overcome, common ends to be pursued -- that snapshot of meanings belies the intense and evolving connections felt by individuals and groups to the meanings carried by stories. Recognizing the need to update the traditional corporate communications model of top-down, “create-and-control,” and reactive messaging and story-making,Harvard Business School’s Boris Groysberg and Michael Slind argue for the advantages of organizational communication as conversation(2012). This alternative model allows for the production of more personal, interactive, participatory, and intentional flow of information and ideas. In this way, organizational stories and the cultures they help constitute and sustain have the potential to become more coordinated, inclusive, and strategically relevant.
To speak of coordination and inclusion raises an essential reality of organizational stories and cultures alike. While more personal conversations, active listening, and substantive dialogues hold the promise of crafting strongly shared stories, more conversation typically also entails additional competition and disagreement. In groups, including teams and organizations, the determination of which stories are agreed to -- as well as which others are acceptable alternatives and which are beyond the realm of consideration -- shape the prevailing norms, beliefs, and actions of the group. For students of organizational and system dynamics, this translates into the realization that a central function of cultures is to establish boundaries of inclusion and exclusion based in differences of beliefs, knowledge, capability, or other differences. Stories can play multiple roles in this process, for example, both marking in their content or expression the definition of inclusion (and exclusion) and also serving as a basis for individuals to demonstrate their commitment to the group.
Systems Leaders achieve mastery as storytellers by developing the living stories required by ever-changing organizations and circumstances (and, in the process, engaging in their own ongoing selfmaking). “They organize complexity into profoundly simple terms,” write Kim S. Cameron, Robert E. Quinn, Jeff Degraff, and Anjan V. Thakor, positing that leaders in the role of masters can create greater value within enterprises (Cameron, Quinn, Degraff, and Thakor 2006: 3-4). While not all stories attain profound simplicity, the best stories do succeed in organizing complexity into meaningful, motivational or persuasive, situationally-relevant, and forward-looking expressions.
To close our brief exploration of stories and the Systems Leader, it is useful to remember that systems leadership is not primarily about leadership or organizations or even stories or culture. Rather than a fuller understanding of the design of organizations or detailed constitution of systems, in other words, the essential focus of leadership is on better understanding and advancing the human endeavor of gathering people together to accomplish common ends that deliver some agreed-upon value.
As Stanford’s Stephen Barley and Tel Aviv University’s Gideon Kunda argue,a shortcoming of organizational research is precisely that it dwells on the organization itself instead of the work the people, resources, and vision were organized to do in the first place. “Bringing work back in,” as they urge, is not simply a matter of crafting more imaginative or sophisticated team or organizational designs in hopes of increasing innovation or productivity. It is a call to leaders to return to first principles about how they can better learn to lead other people and to operate together more knowingly and effectively in systems. Stories and storytelling, as we have endeavored to show, are central tools and activities in both pursuits.
