### "Women Talking" & Introspective Leadership

18 February 2023|Culture, Everyday Leadership, Leadership
We continue our series of pieces asking what we can learn about leadership from the Oscar-nominated Best Picture films announced by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Like most of you, we are moved by the culture around us, and often we learn from that culture. We decided to take a look at the 10 nominated films and see what insights about leadership we can glean from the characters, themes, or locations. Our next contribution in this series is about the remarkable "Women Talking."
Women Talking: Self-Reflection Driving Leadership
If the mark of a good leader is being able to move peers to action, then the Oscar-nominated “Women Talking” is a rare look at how a motivated group of people can radically change their lives based on the leadership of a handful of female family elders.
The film’s plot revolves around an agrarian religious community where the women have been brutally beaten and raped by male community members. The male members of the community who don’t participate blame the women’s imaginations or the Devil, despite the evidence, leaving the women nowhere to go.
After a particularly brutal attempt on a couple of teen girls, and the arrest of the perpetrator, the men go into a nearby town to bail him out of jail. The women are left to debate their future alone, save a meek male teacher who documents their conversation. The matriarchs of three families are selected to make a decision about whether to stay, fight, or leave the farm. The problem? The men have kept the women uneducated, with no knowledge of the secular world, and threatened with God’s damnation for any attempt to revolt.
Directed by Sarah Polley from a novel by Miriam Toews, the film spotlights the conversation between the female family members arguing for their lives and the lives of their daughters and sons. It is wise, poignant, and laced with a level of introspection that elevates the conversation beyond the facts.
At On Global Leadership, we’re fans of leaders adopting introspection as a central principle governing their leadership lives. Leaders need to ask hard questions, but first and foremost, they must pose those questions to themselves. How much are you thinking about and analyzing yourself, your own motivations, you own anxieties and your own goals? To what extent are you being honest about all of them as you lead others? Close personal assessment and honestly sharing your thoughts, flawed or not, can help motivate your peers.
In “Women Talking,” a group of women facing an extremely bleak future decide to look inward, debate their options, and lead their family members and friends through a difficult choice – and one with no guarantee of success.
