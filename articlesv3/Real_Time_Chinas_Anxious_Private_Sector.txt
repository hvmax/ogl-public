On Global Leadership's regular feature, OGL Real Time, presents our up-to-the-minute insights on current news and events. We hope these breaking news insights from our OGL team members will help illuminate the events of the day and provide the depth needed to understand global political, economic and cultural transitions and transformations. In this post, we examine the State’s relationship with the private sector in China today.China's private sector contributes more than 50% of tax revenue, 60% of GDP, 70% of innovative capacity, 80% of urban employment, and more than 90% new jobs in the country. At the recently concluded2 Session meetings, China's leaders repeatedly signaled their support for the private sector. This Real Time Q&A considers the government’s attitudes and policies about the private economy and their impact on entrepreneurs and private companies.

Beijing has emphasized that the non-public sector's status and role in China’s economic and social development have not changed, nor has the country’s encouragement in terms of principles, policies and initiatives to develop the sector. Why do private entrepreneurs still lack confidence in these declarations? Will the messages from the top be heard, and work?
The fact that top leaders, including Xi Jinping and Li Qiang (the new premier),expressed supportfor the private sector during the 2 Sessions, and that has illustrated the following:
Many private entrepreneurs doubt whether the central government's policy to support private enterprises can be sustained in the long term. China’s top leaders recognize the misgivings and want to change their opinions.Despite similar messages being expressed at the World Economic Forum's Annual Meeting 2023 in Davos, Switzerland by Vice Premier Liu He,andat the recent 2 Sessions, the effect is insignificant.For the Chinese economy to rebound in 2023, it is crucial to have a robust private economy.

China's private economy can be divided into two parts; one part includes small and micro enterprises and self-employed individuals, and the other medium, large and mega enterprises represented by giants like Tencent and Alibaba. Leaving aside industry factors, the former is generally impacted by China's economic slowdown and insufficient demand caused by three years of epidemic prevention and control, while the latter is more affected by policies and public opinion.
As there were no precise explanations of some policies then they were released, it caused some confusion and even misunderstandings. For example, common prosperity is digested as "equal distribution of wealth" or "robbing the rich to help the poor". There were also voices likening it to supervision on platform enterprises and anti-monopoly measures.
People in China agree it is necessary to “prevent disorderly expansion of capital”; the question is how to define it? Have Tencent and Alibaba expanded disorderly? Have those legally operating education and training institutions, which were banned by a sheet of administrative order overnight, expanded disorderly?
In recent years, some radical remarks have emerged from time to time on social media. They stigmatize private enterprises, label private entrepreneurs as "capitalists", and call for pursuing the original sin of private business. Negative public opinion has made many private entrepreneurs timid, hesitant and hidden.

When meeting the press, Li responded in great detail to the question about the private economy. “Indeed, there were some incorrect discussions about private entrepreneurs last year, which made them feel concerned”, Li said. He acknowledged the negativity and then promoted his methodology called"four thousand spirits"(1), which originated in the early stage of developing the private economy in Zhejiang in the 1980s. Li is the first high-level Chinese leader to openly admit there is public controversy over the private sector, and one of the few leaders to mobilize initiatives and promote entrepreneurship. During his career in Zhejiang, Jiangsu, and Shanghai, Li has exhibited a pro-business style, and his message conveyed during the 2 Sessions has given people some hope.
Having said this, entering the new era, Beijing also expects the private sector to make changes in its behavior. Xi is concerned that private enterprises often rush forward into a business and then disperse all together. (先是一哄而起，最后一哄而散). Some private entrepreneurs operate like gamblers; when they win, the wealth goes to them; when they lose, the mess is left to the government to take care of. Recent cases such as Li Hejun of Hanergy or Xu Jiayin of Evergrande, both once described as the richest man in China, revealed their irresponsibility to their customers and investors. Li Qiang wishes private entrepreneurs to regain confidence in China’s encouragement of the private sector as they start their new journey; it also implies the expectation of private entrepreneurs to produce a more compliant, socially responsible way of doing business.
On the street, people often ask when well-known entrepreneurs like Jack Ma will return to China? But if the landscape for private economy has truly improved, does it matter whether Jack Ma, who has created a global enterprise, lives in Tokyo, Singapore, Hangzhou, or Beijing?

To rebuild the confidence of the private sector, it is crucial for China’s national government to maintain policy stability. Private enterprises want to be protected from chop-and-change policies, and live within the guardrails in accordance with the law. Direct interference by administrative forces must be minimized for any legally operated enterprise. If they want to change today's wait-and-see attitude in the private sector, words and promises alone are not enough. If China's economy does recover, new opportunities will emerge, and hopefully the animal spirits of entrepreneurs and capital will reappear.
