4 February 2022|Leadership, Leadership Development
Over the next several months,On Global Leadershipwill be publishing a six-part series of articles on the topic of organizational and leadership adaptability. This introduction provides the overall context for the series. Previous posts on leadership have developed Sensemaking, Solutionmaking, andSelfmakingas “dynamic capabilities” of teams and organizations driven and shaped by systems thinking. Here, Mohammad Z. Iqbal explores the complexity of organizational leadership through the lens of adaptability. —The OGL Editors

Business literature has often treated leadership as a set of traits or personality behaviors that allow a person to be an effective leader. Over the years, the list of these leadership traits has grown exponentially and includes a plethora of common-sense items such as empathy, vision, decisiveness, and integrity.
This list creates several problems. The overabundance of desirable leadership qualities leaves potential leaders and organizations overwhelmed with which behaviors best represent a successful leader, forcing people to claim possession of every possible leadership trait in vogue at the time. In addition, discussions on business leadership attributes often remain at a philosophical level focusing on how to demonstrate and claim a certain trait, but often failing to explain how a leadership trait translates into actionable items related to how a business produces value.
A consequence of the identification of leadership behaviors is the debate over whether specific leadership traits can be taught or are naturally present has also continued for several decades. There is no consensus on a manageable set of required behaviors, and a scan of successful business, political, and public sector leaders (in terms of growth or achievement of strategic goals) shows a wide range of personalities. There are nice successful leaders that grow their organizations and there are those that make their employees’ lives a living hell but still manage to achieve growth. There are democratic leaders that have helped their companies reach new levels of financial performance, and there are autocratic leaders who seem to successfully lead large teams and achieve significant results.
As the business, economic, social, and political environments constantly undergo change and new and previously unidentified risks surface, business and public sectors leaders face an ongoing challenge to successfully navigate through uncertain and unexpected conditions. This is nothing new, and the history of both commercial companies and governments is littered with examples of leaders who successfully planned and maneuvered their way through changing conditions or who failed to adapt resulting in strategic and economic losses. In many of these cases, apparently successful leaders with all required leadership qualities failed exceptionally once the conditions they previously encountered changed because they continued to press on with their pre-defined leadership qualities and paradigms without understanding how to adapt them to new circumstances.
We believe there is one leadership attribute that is more critical than others – adaptability. However, instead of assuming that adaptability is another one of those nice sounding attributes that every leader should claim to have, we believe there are specific actions that need to be taken across the business or public sector value chain to enable a business or leader to be adaptable.
Adaptability is also important because it impacts and helps define other leadership qualities. For example, a leader may have empathy – but how this attribute should manifest itself depends on the situation. Empathy shown in the context of a business that is facing major market disruption and is close to being bankrupt is different from how a leader exhibits empathy in a business that is doing extremely well requiring its staff to work long hours. Similarly, a simple skill such as attentive listening needs to be adapted to each situation a leader may encounter. When dealing with an experienced group that works in a culture that encourages dissent, a leader requires different types of listening abilities, but when dealing with a group that does not actively contribute, the leader may have to adapt  listening abilities to encourage thoughtful discussions.
Adaptability is not just a behavioral trait that you either possess or lack. To be adaptable requires training and development of skills in many different areas. Adaptability is not merely the willingness to change with changing circumstances - everyone understands the need to be adaptable. It’s a word that probably shows up in the most-admired strengths of every aspiring leader. Rather, we believe that adaptability is the ability to recognize and put in place the structural elements and levers that enable a leader or an organization to evolve and respond effectively to changing circumstances. A business delivers results through certain activities such as conducting planning, understanding and mitigating risks, managing operations, or implementing change. Adaptability, therefore, requires an in-depth understanding of how organizations, both commercial and public sector, work and deliver value.
How Businesses Create ValueA business or public sector organization delivers expected results by successfully executing a number of iterative activities (Figure 1) that initiate through a planning phase where the organization’s strategy is developed, reviewed, and discussed. Decisions are then made regarding the plans and allocation of financial and other resources to execute the plans. The organization acquires and manages required assets and talent and executes its plans. On an ongoing basis, the organization monitors a multitude of risks and takes actions to mitigate them. Finally, changes are often required and implemented either to adjust the organization’s structure or its operating model, its operations, or its processes. Each of these activities requires specific controls and mechanisms and can act as a lever to improve the adaptability of an organization.
Adaptable leaders excel at identifying and implementing those controls and mechanisms and recognizing the importance of these levers of adaptability – this requires knowing not only what to do but also what to avoid doing.
This series of articles will discuss six levers of adaptability (excluding execution of plans, which represents all operational activities undertaken by an organization) shown in Figure 1. We will discuss how these typical activities and elements can be rewired and used as levers, allowing leaders to build in adaptability into their organizations.
Part 1: Strategy and Planning
We will begin by looking at how the strategy and planning activity within an organization supports the adaptability needed to respond to unexpected events.
Part 2: Risk and Uncertainty Management
Every crisis has an underlying cause and the resulting challenges organizations face emanate from a failure to predict, assess, and manage risks properly. This article will discuss how adaptable leaders can improve risk management at their companies and the public sector by improving their ability to predict and manage major risks.
Part 3: Organizing for Adaptability
Organizational structure (including the lines and boxes) and the resulting capabilities and culture provide an important lever of adaptability. We will explore how leaders can put in place better structures and cultural elements to improve organizational adaptability.
Part 4: Decision Making
Leadership adaptability depends heavily on the decision-making processes put into place. The balance between decision quality and decision timing can determine whether an organization can successfully adapt or not. This requires both an understanding of how good decisions are made quickly and also how flexible approval structures can be put into place to support adaptable decision-making.
Part 5: Change Management
Change management is a frequent topic addressed in business literature. However, despite all the available best practices and frameworks, businesses and particularly public sector organizations continue to face major challenges implementing meaningful change. We will identify some practices adaptable leaders can implement to improve their organizations’ ability to manage change and successfully adapt to changing situations.
Part 6: Talent Management
An organization’s ability to adapt to changing circumstances depends on the adaptability of its workforce. The workforce adaptability, in turn, is linked to having diverse experiences. Yet many companies and public sector organizations continue to utilize archaic requirements that focus on hiring and rewarding talent with narrow and specialized experience. In managing talent, organizations and companies often employ systems that are geared towards maintaining consistency of ideas and practices. This creates the myopic view sometimes prevalent in industries and eliminates chances of infiltration of fresh ideas. This article will discuss and provide ideas adaptable leaders can implement to better manage their talent.
