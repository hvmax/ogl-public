### REAL TIME: YELLEN'S 2024 CHINA TRIP

10 April 2024|China, China politics, Economic Development, Trade, US-China Relations
On Global Leadership’s regular feature OGL Real Time presents our up-to-the-minute insights on current news and events. We hope these breaking news insights from our OGL team members will help illuminate the events of the day and provide the depth needed to understand global political, economic, and cultural transitions and transformations. In this post, we examine Secretary Janet Yellen’s current visit to China. This Real Time considers the motivations behind the visits and the larger political context in which this important trip occurs. We examine a variety of issues raised by these visits, taking into account our own analyses as well as what the OGL team in China hears and sees in local media, social media, and on-the-ground popular sentiment.
This is an important time for the global political economy and for US-China relations specifically. We have written extensively about US-China relations, with articles analyzing the appointment of US trade czar Katherine Tai, Secretary of Treasury Janet Yellen’s visit to China in July of 2023, and Secretary of State Anthony Blinken’s visit in June of 2023 (seehereandhere). The fact that Yellen and Blinken are returning to visit the US’s largest trading partner within a year is certainly worthy of note. Focusing now on Secretary Yellen’s trip, some immediate questions emerge:
1. Should we be heartened by the return of Blinken and Yellen to China for new talks over the next few weeks?
First, let’s put this visit in a little context. We have written in a number of articles and posts that this has been an incredibly important year for US-China relations. In many ways, this long, evolving relationship feels as intense and as critical now as it has in decades. With growing engagement in the 1990s, we saw President Clinton deal with China’s Most Favored Nation (and eventually Permanent Normal Trade Relations) status; China’s accession into the World Trade Organization in 2001; and growing engagement between the world’s two largest economies (China became the world’s 2nd largest economy in 2010). There was a significant cooling with the election of President Trump and his appointment of Peter Navarro as director of the White House National Trade Counsel. The tepid relations warmed some with the election of President Biden, but there was still a sense that the United States and China were engaged in an intricate, subtle dance, sending nuanced signals to each other about engagement and respect. Given this new dynamic, questions arose: Who would be dominant in this new phase of relations? Who would kowtow to whom?
Then came 2023, a big year for China and a very significant year for US-China relations. In March 2023, Beijing played a central role in the brokering of the Iran-Saudi Arabia agreement to resume diplomatic relations, a very significant moment for the global geopolitical systemandfor China. In a short four-month span over the summer, Yellen, Blinken, and Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo all visited China. In November 2023, President Xi flew across the Pacific to meet Biden as the US hosted the APEC meetings in San Francisco. And now, less than a year since her last visit, Yellen is back in China again, and Blinken will follow in a “few weeks.”
While many people say that US-China quarreling is better than estrangement, Chinese people think at least we are trying to understand each other and reduce misjudgments. Yellen is seen as the only dovish member in Biden’s cabinet with respect to China. Historically, Beijing and the U.S. Treasury ministers appear to have a good relationship, going back at least three decades, focusing on the engagement and tone of previous US Treasury secretaries like Robert E. Rubin (Clinton), Lawrence Summers (Clinton), Henry Paulson (President George W. Bush), and even Steven Mnuchin (Trump).
Yellen is often described as a scholar stateswoman – a purposive and significant description, knowing the extent to which Chinese citizens respect scholars. As long as she claims no decoupling, which she has repeatedly emphasized on this visit, other issues can be dealt with academically.
The Blinken visit will be interesting to watch, as he is generally viewed as significantly blunter than his Treasury counterpart. Recently, at the February 2024 Munich Security Conference, Blinken responded to a question about “US-China tensions” saying, “If you are not at the table in the international system, you are going to be on the menu.” While some observers found his remark cryptic – Who is at the table? Who is on the menu? – to the Chinese it was a throwback Chinese to 19th Century when the imperialists dissected China. For Chinese observers, Blinken needs to come up with something new and diplomatic, perhaps more practical such as reciprocity treatment and mutual respect. If he continues to hop on the Xinjiang issue, he is going to be perfunctorily dealt with. As the Chinese President has just met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in Beijing, it will be interesting to see if Blinken will get the same treatment.
2. On Friday, April 5, Secretary Yellen’s first full day of meetings in Guangzhou, she said she wanted to address the oversupply of Chinese goods in key industries, such as electric vehicles (EVs) and solar panels. Many believe the increased level of goods for export makes up for weak demand at home. What are the consequences of China agreeing to US demands, and would it even consider a change in production levels?
China’s excess capacity in several key sectors has been a concern over the years, and Yellen’s statement drawing attention to the issue is not novel or new. Indeed, when Yellen stated that “we have seen this story before,” apparently alluding to China’s overcapacity production of steel over the years. Indeed, many economists point to China’s excess production of steel in the early 2000-2020 as one of the forces that decimated the US steel industry. Further, it is true that China is producing goods in key industries, such as lithium batteries, electric vehicles, and solar panels, and some economists and pundits have pointed to weaknesses in China’s economy as the driver for flooding global markets.
Our view is that these analyses are simplistic. While a case can possibly be made for China’s overproduction and dumping of steel in years past, we believe it is a stretch to apply the overcapacity and anti-dumping language and norms to products like solar panels, lithium batteries, and electric vehicles. While some economists argue that overcapacity norms should be tied to national consumption rates – for example, China produces about 80% of the world’s solar panels, while internal consumption and utilization rates are significantly lower – and if China’s production outpaces consumption, then there must be nefarious intent. Further, when a country’s production significantly outpaces utilization rates, many observers believe the nation must be trying to flood global markets, drive prices down, and push competitors out of business.
However, much as it pains us to point out the obvious:This is the way free market capitalism works. Neoclassical Economic Theory loves the idea of free and unfettered markets… except for when the theory is bad for US firms and the US economy. Unfettered markets often lead to fluctuations between production and consumption until a market equilibrium is reached. We simply cannot have it both ways. We cannot advocate for free, unfettered markets and then cry foul when market competition drives prices down. It is just a silly argument.
Perhaps more importantly, the overcapacity and overproduction in technical products such as solar panels, lithium batteries, and electric vehicles is part of a larger agenda of building the most complex and sophisticated manufacturing supply chain in the world. Remarkably, China has accomplished this feat over the last four decades. It is our view that Chinese policy makers still believe there is much work to do and much room for growth in continuing to build this powerful manufacturing supply chain. In sum, we believe it is unlikely that China will agree to US demands to curb production volumes and product export levels.
3. In her widely watched and publicized speeches in Guangzhou and Beijing, Yellen emphasized the importance of cooperation and collaboration in trade between the world’s two largest economies. She also raised issues like the “protection of US national security interests” and the “coercive” practices toward some American firms. As the tone and substance of these speeches spread throughout China, how can we best summarize the sentiment and reception of these speeches in China?
When talking about Yellen’s visit to China, we should not forget that Biden and Xi Jinping held a phone call ahead of Yellen’s trip, her statements and remarks in China have not deviated from the tone set by Biden. The feedback we observed can be divided into the following:
The official statements were generally positive, but while emphasizing the desire for cooperation, China's dissatisfaction is also made public, this can be seen from the titles below.

In addition to tidbits about Cantonese and Sichuan cuisine, and beer, Yellen's "overcapacity" theory is the most mentioned topic on China's social media, and she has been criticized a lot. Because Biden has not removed special tariffs on China established during the Trump administration, while also further strengthening restrictions on high-tech, the distrust in social media reactions is strong. Accusations of overcapacity have been viewed on social media as the US trying to block China in developing high tech. There is a widespread fear that US restrictions on these China-dominant industries will come soon, so the Chinese government and companies should be prepared.In talking about overcapacity, what U.S. trade representative Tai said in Brussels is widely quoted: “I think what we see in terms of the challenge that we have from China is… the ability for our firms to be able to survive in competition with a very effective economic system,” China’s “very effective” alternative economic model is a threat to market-based economies in the United States and Europe. In these new industries, winners like BYD and CATL are private companies that excel from fierce market competition. Pushing Beijing to influence these industries with executive orders should not come from Yellen.

4. China did not hold its “Third Plenum” meeting in the fall of 2023 and has not yet set a date for the highly anticipated plenary session. Are there any signs Chinese leaders may be considering holding the meeting shortly. If not, why the continued delay?
The CPC Constitution states there should be at least one-party plenum a year. Since the 2nd plenum was held in February 2023, the fact the 3rd plenum didn’t happen last fall is not violating the rule, but it definitely has to occur in 2024.
Why are people so interested in this meeting and speculating about why it has not convened? There could be two counts. First, traditionally the 3rd plenum happens in a year after the new central committee, in this current assembly the 20th CPC central committee was selected in Oct 2022. After the new leadership formed and the new party goals were set, the 3rd plenum brings the political and economic reform tasks forward in details and processes. The resolution and draft decisions will be the guiding instruments for the rest of the five-year term and even longer.
Second, the unspoken Chinese political decision cycle starts during each year’s summer beach vacation inBeidaihewhere top leaders and the retired influential senior officials meet informally and exchange ideas. When they reach agreements, these will become the new agenda for the central committee meeting in the fall, and then for the people’s congress in the following spring.
Reasons the 3rd Plenum didn’t happen in the fall could include: (1) The seniors were not consulted by the incumbent party head or nothing new came out; (2) Some pending critical events that require adjustments and counter actions (e.g. the Taiwan election). We suspect the 3rd plenum will be held after Taiwan’s new president is sworn in, which occurs on May 20, 2024.
5. Wang Shouwen, a Vice Commerce Minister and Head of International Trade Negotiations, visited the United States at the end of March for the first Vice-Ministerial meeting of a bilateral commerce and trade working group. What do you think China is hoping to get out of these bilateral meetings?
It is our view that China would like to see its relationship with the United States return to one of constructive engagement and economic cooperation. These nations are so deeply intertwined that it is not healthy for either economy to engage in a process of decoupling. It is clear that bets are being hedged – China’s Belt and Road Initiative is as much about pivoting away from deep dependence on the US as it is about developing new markets. But both economies would be deeply damaged by a serious decoupling. Chinese economists and policy makers take this interdependence seriously. Our view is that these Vice-Ministerial meetings are important because this is where the real work gets done. While positive signals are sent with secretary-level visits of Yellen and Blinken, in some ways, the close media tracking is a detriment to getting real work accomplished. It is in these meetings, which are held away from the bright glare of the media, that difficult topics like chip manufacturing, cross-border data flows, and, at times, coercive pressures on major US companies operating in China can be discussed openly. Press releases and public speeches help little in advancing the hard work of international economic cooperation. Vice-Ministerial and Vice-Secretarial level meetings have a much better shot at working through the difficult details. In sum, we have high hopes for these meetings.
