7 February 2024|China, China politics, Economic Development
The On Global Leadership team is pleased to offer up a chapter in the forthcomingResearch Handbook of Chinese Corporate Governance, which is edited by Martin Conyon, Lerong He, and Edward Elgar.
Our chapter, "Corporate Governance in Today’s China: China’s Political Regime and Economic System", examines the issue of corporate governance in today’s China.
The building of a stable corporate governance infrastructure has been an ongoing process over China’s forty-plus years of economic reform. As with all of China’s major institutional transformations over the four decades since the “Economic Opening” in 1978-79, the process has been gradual and experimental.
The chapter can be foundhere, and it is the work of OGL's Doug Guthrie, Dashiell Chien, Chris Gao, Diane Long.
