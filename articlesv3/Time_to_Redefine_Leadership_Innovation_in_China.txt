### Time to Redefine Leadership Innovation in China

27 September 2020|China, China history, China politics, Innovation
AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy and, in particular, life in China. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. We are advancing a conversation about leadership in these times of crisis informed by innovative economic development in China and the progression of sustainable capitalism. We are also building an economic database of cities in China to better understand how jurisdictions cope with today’s economic and political forces. In this post, we continue our analysis and discussion of innovation in China. – The Editorial Team

The Chinese are not innovative. This oft-repeated line is a fashionable statement to pigeonhole China into a world ofshanzhai(“copycat”) products. In one conversation we had with a senior engineer of a large multinational a few years ago, we worked to convince this corporate executive of just how much innovation is going on in China. After several minutes of conversation, exasperated, the executive blurted out: “You guys are so impressed with Chinese innovation. But I am telling you, there is nothing innovative here. The innovation is coming from us. They are only following what we do. Imitation is not innovation. You guys need to get that straight.” We left the meeting feeling a little stunned by the shortsightedness of the comment and the attitude.
Perhaps if we had been having this conversation in the China of the 1980s and early 1990s, there might have been some truth to this executive’s point of view. Indeed, for years, many observers from the West have viewed China as industrious and able to copy but unable to innovate. And theshanzhaimovement, which was built on an explicit strategy of copying products, was often held up as exhibit No. 1.[1] However, there is much more to theshanzhaimovement than a trip to a knock-off bazaar can reveal.
What was once a copycat movement has now become a force for taking ideas from around the world, scaling production, refining the products, and, ultimately, innovating. To simply write offshanzhaias a copycat movement misses the point. Core to the notion is that imitation is the fastest way to learn, catch up, and overtake the world’s most admired brands. As we referenced in a previous piece, “The Future is Collaborative Innovation,” the 2014 article by Regina Abrami, William, Kirby, and F. Warren McFarlan has been quoted repeatedly so as to set the tone for the foundation of understanding in the area of Chinese innovation.
We are here to say that these views are simply out of date and completely miss what is going on in China today. As those of us who have lived in China over several decades can attest to, China does not stand still. The evolution of Chinese society and people never stops. And never has this been so obvious as in its conception of innovation. Even an on-point article from just six years ago can now be considered out of date.
We believe that the inadequate analysis and understanding of Chinese innovation comes down to the word and its definition. What does it mean to be innovative? If one were to talk to a number of western companies in Shanghai, they would attest to the innovation happening in China. When interviewing western executives recently, the top challenge to their success in China, they said, is keeping up with their Chinese competitors. The Chinese are able to maintain momentum and produce at a speed to market that was unfathomable 20 years ago. Part admiration and part stress, the compliment from their western competitors is that the Chinese move quickly to recreate, test, and roll out new business models. In short, the Chinese are intense competitors.
As Thomas Friedman wrote in his 2011 book,That Used to Be US, the “network effect” essentially says that “the more stuff happens the more stuff will happen,” is on full display in China.[2] This scalability—driven by sheer numbers involved at the foundation of the production chain—is fundamental to the results the world is seeing.
These innovative ideas are flowing through something called the Carlson’s Law. “Innovation that happens from the top down tends to be orderly but dumb. Innovation that happens from the bottom up tends to be chaotic but smart.”[3] And that is what we see in China. Companies that the world has never heard of can change the name of the game in China. In true entrepreneurial spirit, without an MBA-trained manager and without deep market analysis, an innovative CEO could launch a new product never realizing that it was not supposed to make that product if it had never made it before. In China today, it usually takes drawings on the back of the envelope with a few trusted friends for a new entrepreneurial project to pop up. With time, one can see what sticks and what doesn’t.

Mobility vehicles.One example of this dynamic is the motorcycle company Luoyang Northern Ek Chor Motorcycle Co., Ltd., which was established in 1992. Its headquarters is in the city of Luoyang in Henan Province. Luoyang has a long, illustrious history, having been the capital of China for 14 different dynasties and governments, and it is popular with tourists for the majesty of its Buddhist cave sculptures rising above the Luohe River. Despite the city's history, it is now famous for the company's major brand - DAYANG and its products, including its motorcycles, electric bicycles, scooters, tricycles, and quadricycles. The company has grown far beyond electric scooters and now exports to some 70 countries globally. The newest product is a mobility vehicle using the DAYANG brand. The CHOK-A200 resembles the mini cars of Europe and its postage-stamp size makes it fit just about anywhere. When one visits Luoyang, one is inundated by the DAYANG brand around the city, skirting into traffic, able to zip into the smallest parking space, and happily reducing the owner’s carbon footprint. Essentially, the company has gone through three completely but related product categories in less than 30 years, always leading with innovation.

Online gaming.In the online game entertainment, the No. 1 competitor of Entertainment Arts, the prolific world leader in gaming, is the Chinese competition. Responding to the fast-changing needs of the customer, the typical mass users of online games are actually commuters. How do they entertain themselves on the way to school or work while they’re reading and engaging on their phones? Unlike its western peers, the Chinese online game industry is skipping the personal computer or tablet and moving to mobile directly. Can the U.S. companies that created this industry keep up? Already, Tencent, China’s Internet giant, has risen to the top three online gaming companies, in part, because of the diversity of its game selection. It owns shares in Riot Games, Activision Blizzard, and Epic Games; the most pivotal of the group is Riot Games, which is the developer of the widely popular League of Legends. Tencent also provides a selection of massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPGs) through its QQ Games portal.
What drives the Chinese business community? Quite simply it’s increasing its share of the market, and in the end, simple, old-fashioned profit-seeking. And it does it by responding to the customer, and it emphasizes its customer-centric approach to business. How does that show up?
Customer service. With a customer-centric mentality, Chinese companies live and breathe the life of their customers. They are able and willing to think from the point of view of the client. What this might mean for some products and services is all about the link between price and value. In this model, they might take a high-end premier product, and then strip it of its bells and whistles to lower the price by 30%. The product still achieves the function the customer desired, but because the number of functions has been reduced, the price has been reduced. Home appliances are easily adjusted for every price point, and the sales are made. Just reduce the number of dials, presto the price comes down.
Some might feel the Chinese are doing this by cutting corners on quality, but actually the reverse is true. Lessons have been learned, and the customers benefit from that knowledge. The customer is actually willing to pay for quality, but in this case, the value-for-purpose mentality. They are willing to look up and down the value chain to find the product at the price that customers are willing to purchase.
Another area of innovation comes in the creativity of using technology in areas one had not thought of before. Autonomous driving is an exciting area for this. While almost 100% of the data collected is focused on passenger mobility as well as transportation, there is a whole new area of driver-less vehicles under development here in China. What better place to showcase a new concept than on the new Jing-Xiong Highway, which links Beijing to the new capitol city project. One of the most tedious tasks in road building is the road leveling process. The tractor pushes the roller back and forth for hours. The human driver can get quite bored, sometimes forgetting himself, driving off the road, or zigzagging, resulting in uneven roads. But what about inserting autonomous driving sensors on the tractors, lining them up side-by-side, and letting them go at it? Such an approach will for other tasks that require logic and technique.
Another transport concept that is just dying to be automated is street cleaning. Street cleaning trucks drive at a steady state, follow a pre-planned route up and down streets. Of course, there are many obstacles along the path, especially in China. Besides the regular parked cars and errant pedestrians, there are also multiple mopeds and jay walkers that all add more complexity to the driver-less-vehicle environment. This concept is now being tested in China as well. What’s next? With a population of 1.4 million people, the scalability of an idea is at the speed of light. Nowhere in the world is the network effect more in evidence.
In the end, we believe that innovation is alive and well in China. There is a strong orientation toward and few prohibitions against copying the approaches, trends, and technologies of other great companies and economies. However, China’s product and manufacturing development does not end with imitation. The constant push for improvement and competition with others in this vast economy, leads inevitably from imitation to scaling to refinement and, ultimately, to new kinds of competitive innovation. It’s time to redefine what we mean by innovation in China and not underestimate what is happening there.

[1]Shanzhaiis a Chinese term that literally means “mountain stronghold.” It is a term borrowed from the warlord period in which localities far away from the control of the Central Government were adeptly taking care of themselves. The term was later adopted to refer to shadow economy practices that stood beyond the reach of the law in the 1940s in Hong Kong and the 1950s and 1960s in China. It was later re-introduced into China in the 1980s, as Chinese entrepreneurs were encouraged to copy the technology and products of more advanced economies.
