AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy and, in particular, life in China. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. We have sought to advance a conversation about the U.S.-China relationship, and a deep understanding of local economic development in China. We have written a series about the strategic strength oflocal economic development in China’s 2nd and 3rd tier citiesandentrepreneurship in China today. These case studies are part of a larger project in which we report on the strength of China’s economic development model (e.g.,hereandhere). Our focus in these posts are on the Chinese theory of economic development – what Andrew Walder has called “local governments as industrial firms” – and on examples of local leaders operating in this practice of development. In many ways, these local leaders are the hidden heroes of China’s economic development prowess. This post adds to that conversation.
In previous posts, we have spelled out our argument for what has made China’s economic development model so successful. As with previous posts, we once again unpack this dynamic interaction of national development goals and the pressures faced, and actions cities lower in China’s administrative hierarchy, cities like Changzhou of Jiangsu Province. We analyze these cases through the lens of Andrew Walder’s (1995) concept of “local governments as industrial firms.” As with other case studies, we here again begin with the theoretic logic that undergirds this project. Quoting heavily from our previous post on Zhenjiang (see here):
“Economic development in China is fundamentally shaped by government guidance and centralized control. This has been true since the beginning of the economic reforms (and during the Communist Era as well). However, while we often think of the Chinese government as the authoritarian, protectionist, centralized party in Beijing, that is only one side of the government. In reality, local governments are the engines driving China’s growth. Indeed, the Chinese government is an extremely decentralized and entrepreneurial system of district and township governments. The mayors of China’s districts, townships, and villages behave like corporate CEOs, focusing on KPIs, pursuing foreign investment, and advancing their own careers through the financial and economic achievements in their districts and townships. But they don’t do it alone – they do it through close coordination with China’s private sector and with foreign investors from abroad. Companies like Tencent, Alibaba, and Huawei, but also Apple, GM, Boeing, and Microsoft have worked closely with these local governments to drive a phenomenon of local state competition. What the Chinese have discovered is that private property is not the cornerstone of capitalism, as economists have long thought – local competition is. Thus, while rapid privatization programs were unleashed on the former Soviet Bloc, China carefully set in place a balance between state control and local state incentives. It then mixed this balance with enough autonomy for local governments to go out and recruit partners from the private sector and abroad. It has allowed China to build the most dynamic manufacturing supply chain in the world. And it has allowed China to quietly become one of the most innovative economies in the world. Through our analyses of cases that range from Tier 1 cities like Shanghai, Hangzhou, and Shenzhen to Tier 2, 3, and 4 cities like Changzhou, Zhenjiang, Nantong, Guiyang, and many others, we analyze how local governments are creating the framework for a new economic landscape in China.”
“Economic development in China is fundamentally shaped by government guidance and centralized control. There is a lot of strategic planning going on in five-year plans, 10-year plans, and 20-year plans. This has been true since the start of economic reforms and during the Mao Era as well. While we often think of the Chinese government as an authoritarian, protectionist, and centralized party in Beijing, that is only one side of the government. In practice, local governments are the true engines driving China’s growth. Indeed, the Chinese government is an extremely decentralized and entrepreneurial system of district and township governments. The mayors of China’s districts, townships, and villages behave like corporate CEOs, focusing on Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), pursuing foreign investment, and advancing their own careers through the financial and economic achievements in their districts and townships.”
“But local governments don’t do it alone. They do it through close coordination with China’s private sector and with foreign investors from abroad. Companies like Tencent, Alibaba, and Huawei are partners, of course, but also Apple, GM, Boeing, and Microsoft have worked closely with these local governments to drive local state competition. And they work to choose areas to build industrial clusters. What the Chinese have discovered is that private property is not the cornerstone of capitalism, as economists have long thought – local competition is. Thus, while rapid privatization programs were unleashed on the former Soviet Bloc, China carefully set in place a balance between state control and local incentives. It then mixes this balance with enough autonomy for local governments to go out and recruit partners from the private sector and abroad to build industrial clusters that build their local economies.”
Changzhou – Entrepreneurship Behind China’s New Energy Capital
In recent years, the list of cities with a GDP exceeding ￥1 trillion ($143 billion) has been a hot topic regarding China’s regional economy. According to official data of 2023, Yantai City in Shandong Province and Changzhou City in Jiangsu Province have crossed the threshold and become the new members of the “Trillion City Club” in China. However, despite the economic parity between these two rising Tier 2 cities, Changzhou is much more well-known than Yantai, and the reason is simple: entrepreneurial Changzhou has established itself as China’s “New Energy Capital.”
Changzhou is a prefecture-level city located in Jiangsu Province, about 180 kilometers west of Shanghai and about halfway between Shanghai and Nanjing. It is previously known as Yanling, Piling, and Jinling. It officially became Changzhou in 589. The city has a long history of work in the textile industry, having developed a foothold in textile and related industries in the 1920s and 1930s. Despite living in the shadows of such powerful Tier 1 cities as Shanghai and provincial capital Nanjing, Changzhou has long been regarded as a high performer in business development in the reform era.
The New Energy Capital
For a decade, the new energy industry, from photovoltaic (PV), and power batteries to new energy vehicles, has been reshaping the economic map of Chinese cities. Changzhou is one of the earliest cities in China to develop a new energy industry, the initiative that has become the cornerstone for the city to join the “Trillion City Club.”
Power Battery: Today, 1 out of every 10 new energy vehicles in the world is equipped with power battery made in Changzhou; there are 32 major steps in the production of power batteries, of which Changzhou covers 31 and the well-known enterprises such as CATL, CALB, SVOLT, BEST have factories in the city (1); Changzhou’s enterprises also ranks first in China in the number of registered power battery patents.Electric Vehicle (EV): BYD and Li-Auto (2), the two best-performing EV manufacturers in 2023, both have production bases in Changzhou.PV Industry: Changzhou has a history of developing the PV industry for more than 25 years. Local companies like TrinaSolar and EGING PV went through the ups and downs of the market and stood out as industry leaders; the city has also attracted PV giants like RISEN from other provinces (3). Changzhou has a complete PV industry chain, covering all manufacturing processes except the making of silicon materials.

Changzhou has a complete PV industry chain, covering all manufacturing processes except the making of silicon materials.
In 2022, the Changzhou Municipal Government put forward the goal to make the city a “new energy city,” through building a closed-loop industrial eco-system from power generation, energy storage, and transmission to application. InHurun China New Energy Cities 2023, a report of the top 50 cities in China with the highest concentration of new energy companies, Changzhou ranks fifth after Shenzhen, Shanghai, Suzhou, and Beijing in overall score and number one in new energy investment concentration.
At a time when many Chinese cities are actively developing new energy industries, why do so many well-known companies build factories in Changzhou? Most analysts will give three reasons, i.e., location advantage, complete industrial system, and excellent business environment.
Location Advantage– Changzhou, located in southern Jiangsu province, is seated in the center of the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region, the most economically developed region in China. The city borders the Yangtze River in the north and the Taihu Lake in the south and is located halfway between Shanghai and Nanjing. Changzhou is the transportation hub of YRD, with expressways, high-speed rail, subways, and airports forming a convenient transportation network.
Complete Industrial System– After decades of investment and efforts, the city has built a complete industrial system, its first-class supporting capacity& capability have made the city an ideal location for setting up a manufacturing base. Among 41 industrial divisions, 207 groups, and 666 classes, Changzhou has 37, 191and 605 respectively (5). An EV manufacturer (OEM) in Changzhou can get all parts supplied within 4 hour’s drive. Similarly, parts from Changzhou can also be delivered to OEMs in Shanghai and Ningbo just as quickly. After champion enterprises invest in Changzhou, they are likely to attract upstream and downstream manufacturers and, gradually, an industry cluster will be built there.
Excellent Business Environment– Among Chinese cities, it’s easier to see the government build physical facilities but rarer that the government also creates a better soft environment for investments. The Changzhou government emphasizes the idea of marketization, legalization, and internationalization. Its goal is to make companies in the city have the lowest operation costs, and the highest efficiency, and provide the most stable policy to support the business. The top leaders of the city set Shanghai as the benchmark in terms of government efficiency, and request their fellow staff to “respond to every request otherwise no disturbs (有求必应、无事不扰)” in servicing the business communities.
Entrepreneurship
Beyond the advantages of location, a complete industrial system, and an excellent business environment, the achievements of Changzhou should be attributed more to its people, it is the entrepreneurship spirit retained from the roots of this land that gives Changzhou an edge.
During the Ming and Qing dynasties, Changzhou was for a long time the agricultural and commercial center of Jiangnan (south of the Yangtze River), China’s richest area. 150 years ago, the Changzhou native Sheng Xuanhuai (盛宣怀1844-1916) had the insight that China was facing great changes unseen in thousands of years and became the driving force of the empire’s industrialization and modernization.
In the 1960s, long before China’s reform and opening up, Changzhou began to explore the “one-package(一条龙)” production cooperation model in industry, an early attempt to establish a regional supply chain solution. They began with integrating the production process of corduroy, 11 factories for different production processes like spinning, weaving, and printing & dying, etc. were grouped together. Such a “one-package” production model enhanced the cooperation between factories in the supply chain, greatly improved the output and quality, and made corduroy the most competitive product in the city. By the end of the 1970s, Changzhou had built a regional supply chain for 16 types of products, e.g. corduroy, denim, walk-behind tractors, radios, etc.
Changzhou is one of the regions with the most developed private economy in China. In the early 80s, Changzhou, Suzhou, and Wuxi jointly created the Southern Jiangsu model represented by the thriving of township and village enterprises. Since 2003, the private economy has accounted for more than two-thirds of Changzhou’s economy. Although Changzhou lagged in attracting foreign investment in the 1990s, and thus its economy was surpassed by its two neighbors Suzhou and Wuxi, the entrepreneurship spirit of Changzhou people has allowed the city to seize the opportunities in the 21st century - new energy.
A Case Within a Case: The Restructuring of CALB
In October 2022, the China Aviation Lithium Battery (CALB) Group Co. Ltd., headquartered in Jintan District, Changzhou City, was successfully listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and raised about HK$10.1 billion ($1.3 billion).
Established in 2009 in Luoyang City, Henan Province, CALB was a secondary subsidiary of the Aviation Industry Corporation of China, Ltd. (AVIC), an enterprise controlled by the Central Government. CALB produced power batteries for commercial vehicles like trucks. In 2015, CALB’s revenue exceeded ￥1 billion. Jintan District and CALB set up a joint venture (Jiangsu Company)with a registered capital of ￥4 billion. CALB obtained 30% of the shares and 51% of the voting rights of Jiangsu Company through intangible assets such as intellectual property and production know-how, and Jintan District invested￥2.8 billion in cash for 70% of the shares. Unfortunately, the good days did not last long. In 2017, China significantly reduced subsidies for commercial new energy vehicles, and the revenue of CALB fell sharply, resulting in huge losses in 2017 and 2018. CALB became a huge burden that AVIC wanted to get rid of.
At the beginning of 2018, Jintan District, which bore major risks for their investments in CALB Jiangsu Company, set up a task force to analyze the power battery industry. As a result, Jintan District decided to play a high-stakes game, in restructuring CALB. After restructuring, Jintan District took control of CALB, and its headquarters was moved from Luoyang to Changzhou. A new management team was brought in. They reoriented the business direction and product line to focus on passenger vehicles. The company continued to seek external investments and was restructured into a joint-stock mixed-ownership enterprise. Calculated from CALB’s prospectus, Jintan District has invested an incremental￥3.9 billion before the IPO. CALB achieved explosive growth after the restructuring, its China market share jumped from 9th to 3rd.
The story of CALB reflects the determination and courage of the Changzhou local government to cultivate new industries and get Changzhou’s name well known to China’s venture capitalist community.
An Entrepreneurial Government
The CALB case represents a new model for attracting investment for local governments. In the traditional model, local government attracts investments with preferential land and tax incentives, while in the new model, local government stakes in newly established enterprises. We call it the government venture capital (GVC) model. GVC became widely known to the public after Hefei City’s investment in BOE in 2008.
The GVC model typically includes the following steps:
Step 1: Local government selects industries and target enterprises based on their resource endowments and future planning；
Step 2: Local government negotiates with the target company on policy needs (incentives on land and tax, talents, industrial support, etc.), capital needs (funding, financial subsidies, banking loans, etc.), and benefits for the region (profits and taxes commitment, new employment, exit mechanism, etc.);
Step 3: After signing the agreement, a joint venture (JV) is registered. Local government provides capital to the JV through government-run industrial fund(s).
Step 4: When the project runs smoothly, the local government’s equity will gradually exit and roll into new projects;
Step 5: Ideally, the successful operation of a project with champion companies will lay the groundwork for the overall development of the supply chain of related products.
The breakthrough of the GVC model is that the local government acts as a venture capitalist, investing directly in companies that are strategically important to their region. Investing in new companies in cash signals that the local government is willing to share the risks of a new company, a move to enhance market confidence and attract other non-government investments.
Venture capital is never a smooth-sailing, money-making business. To practice the GVC model puts forward quite high requirements for local governments, it is not only a test for vision, and financial strength, but also luck. As can be seen from the table below, the track record is not always satisfactory. There are successful stories like CALB and Li-Auto, but also the Boston Power failure, and lackluster ones like Zhengzhou Nissan, and BAIC New Energy.
Luoyang’s industrial investment fund also participated in the competition for restructuring CALB, but they were eliminated by AVIC due to their request for guaranteed returns. As China’s institutional mechanisms tend to be intolerant of failure, an entrepreneurial government like Changzhou will have more courage to promote the GVC model.
Beyond One Trillion City
After officially announcing that the city’s GDP has exceeded￥1 trillion, the Changzhou government announced a new slogan: “Start a new journey beyond one trillion (万亿之城再出发)." It also set 6% as the 2024 GDP growth target. Changzhou looks forward to giving full play to its strength and will double down on the new energy industry in the next two years. The city will also cultivate potential industries, especially in the section of biopharmaceuticals. On April 26, 2023, the city’s biggest U.S. investment project, the Medtronic Kanghui Changzhou Science and Technology Park began construction. The park will include a smart manufacturing plant, a research and development center, an innovation incubation hub, and a clinical customer center.
Looking back on the path of developing the new energy industry in Changzhou, there is no silver bullet. It is because of the city’s enduring entrepreneurial spirit; the local government and business community of Changzhou have been exploring and learning from failures. We believe that in the new journey beyond the one-trillion mark, Changzhou will keep the momentum with the synergy of its effective government, daring businesspeople, and smart, and industrious workforce.
