AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy and, in particular, life in China. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. We have written a series about the strategic strength oflocal economic development in China’s 2nd and 3rd tier citiesandentrepreneurship in China today. We have also written about thestrategy and logic of local economic development in China’s reform era. This post furthers our analysis of China’s economic status today by analyzing on how China's leaders are weighing zero-COVID policies and the nation's economic growth.
The Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee held its quarterly review meeting to review and analyze current economic conditions and related work in China.
In the past, these meetings set the stage for China's economic policy for the year. The 419 meeting (held April 19, 2019) concluded the Chinese economy was "generally stable, better than expected, and has a good start", then reiterated "structural deleveraging" and tightened the currency. The 417 meeting in 2020 put forward the "Six Stabilize and Six Ensures" policy (1) for the first time, and stressed that "the impact of the epidemic should be hedged with greater macro policy efforts".
This year's meeting was held on April 29 (429 meeting) at a time when the Omicron variant is hitting China, the downward pressure on the economy has increased, and the stock market has plummeted. Contrary to the convention that important news is released in the evening news, Xinhua News Agency published a complete news release at 1:06 p.m., right after the meeting. The Chinese stock market responded with a sharp rise.
Against the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic and Ukraine crisis, the 429 meeting described the environment facing China as “increasingly complicated, grim and uncertain”. The outbreak of Omicron is not only affecting the consumption and service industries, but also severely impacting logistics, supply chains, industrial production, and exports, so “ it is of vital importance to deliver in our economic work, and to ensure and improve the people's wellbeing”. The CPC Central Committee has made it clear that “we must contain the epidemic, stabilize the economy, and keep development secure (疫情要防住、经济要稳住、发展要安全)”, according to meeting reports. A series of new policies regarding  domestic demand, platform economy, and housing market came out of the meeting as well.
“We must contain the epidemic, stabilize the economy and keep development secure”. Once again, we see a standard formulation of a high-level policy statement in China, "we want not only this, but also that, and …" But what does it mean?
Containing the epidemic ranks No. 1.“In response to the new features of virus variants and their transmission, we must efficiently coordinate COVID response with economic and social development, put the people and their lives first, guard against imported cases and domestic resurgences, and follow a dynamic zero-COVID policy.”
At first glance, this language is commonplace after any outbreak of COVID-19, but now that the sequence is different, the focus has changed. The subtlety lies in how it starts, the Political Bureau has recognized the ”new features of virus variants and their transmission”, so ”we must efficiently coordinate COVID response with economic and social development “. This is the true intention of the 429 meeting. Therefore, it is likely signaling some adjustments to current strict epidemic prevention measures.
For local governments at all levels, their biggest challenge is how to achieve dynamic zero-COVID without affecting economic development, or “keep[ing] development secure” and ensuring there is no underlying systemic risks.
After the Omicron variant outbreak in Shanghai went out of control in March 2022, the largest city in China was forced to lockdown and has suffered heavy losses, both economically and politically. In 2020, Wuhan’s lockdown lasted 76 days, and the city’s GDP in the first half of 2020 dropped 20%.
The most optimistic estimate of when the Shanghai lockdown will finish is the end of May. Under that assumption, we estimate Shanghai’s H1 GDP will shrink about ￥400 billion, and Shanghai will very likely lose its status as China's largest city economy. The Shanghai government's "precise COVID prevention and control" policy, which had been proved effective for two years, is now seen as the cause of systemic risk.
The biggest lesson learned from Shanghai is that due to the high infection rates of the Omicron variant, imposing a lockdown as early as possible along with large-scale nucleic acid testing, seems the only feasible way to achieve dynamic zero-COVID. Today, local officials announce public transportation closures and city lockdowns when they find single-digit infections. In big cities, one or two positive cases would lead to nucleic acid testing of millions of people. Although local officials are clear that these measures will cripple the local economy and social lives, no one wants to repeat what has happened in Shanghai, so they have little choice.
This is certainly not good news for the central government, which wants to have it all. ["not only this, but also that, and..."]
Unless Beijing can provide more specific guidance, local governments will not easily change their approach to COVID. In fact, the "COVID-19 Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatment Plan (Trial Version 9)", released in March 2022, has relaxed some diagnostic criteria. For example, the positive standard of nucleic acid test has been lowered from 40 to 35. Positive patients can be isolated at home after discharge, and the time was reduced from 14 days to 7 days for isolation, and so on. But the judgment that the highest attention is needed to prevent Omicron spreading has not changed, despite the fact that the vast majority of people with Omicron only have upper respiratory tract infections or are asymptomatic.
The housing market.The housing market is described by the meeting as “keep development secure”, and related expressions follow the same logic of epidemic containment. After repeating the key phrase, "Housing is for living in, not for speculation", the meeting reports, "Green light should be given to local governments to improve their real estate policies according to their specific conditions. People's demand for buying their first homes and improving housing conditions should receive due support."
In the past few years, in order to curb the bubble in the housing market, Beijing emphasized, "Housing is for living in, not for speculation" and urged local governments to introduce various policies to restrict housing purchases. While China's fixed asset investment in Q1 2022 has increased by 9.3%, year-on-year, the growth rate of real estate development investment continued to decline, plunging from 25.6% in Q1 2021 to 0.7% in Q1 2022.
If China wants to keep its GDP growth target of 5.5% this year, it cannot let the housing market continue to drag down its economy. Since 2022, about 110 cities have introduced various policies to stabilize the housing market, including Suzhou, Fuzhou, Zhengzhou, Harbin, Qingdao, and Guangzhou. The main changes include lowering the threshold of purchase, the down-payment ratio, and the mortgage interest rate. The 429 meeting is an endorsement of loosening local restrictions from the central government.
Internet platform economy.In order to “keep development secure”, maintaining the strength of the Internet platform economy received some good news during the meeting. The suppression of the past two years will finally come to an end: "The platform economy must develop in a healthy way. Rectifications for it will be completed, regular supervision will be initiated, and specific measures to support its standardized and sound growth will be unveiled.”
Since 2020, Chinese regulators have issued a series of regulations and measures to rectify Internet companies, worsened by market bottlenecks, and the decline of US-China relations. Chinese Internet giants such as Alibaba, Tencent, and JD.com have seen their share prices shrunk sharply, and their growth momentum has been significantly curbed. This has become a major reason for declining confidence in China's economy by the outside world. This meeting statement is a real policy change, and the Internet giants now have something to look forward to in 2022.
The policy statements of the latest Political Bureau meeting still use the formulation --not only this, but also that, and …-- but the focus and methods of the requirements have changed. To put it simply, what the top leaders want most now is to buoy people’s confidence and stabilize the economy, so economic growth will not be overwhelmed by pandemic prevention.
Of course, containing the pandemic still dominates, especially for Beijing, China’s political center, and Shanghai, the nation's economic hub. Beijing will usher in the 20th National Congress of the CPC in the second half of this year. If Beijing cannot control the pandemic, it could threaten the 20th CPC National Congress. Moreover, if Shanghai cannot get rid of the pandemic as quickly as possible and restore the normal life of the city, the pandemic will affect the performance of China's economy in 2022.
Despite all the looming consequences and doubts, the central government will neither change its tough stance on the coronavirus nor the policy of “dynamic zero-COVID” until the antivirus fight is won(3). "Not only this, but also that, and ..." is a unique feature of Chinese political and policy language. Whether these conflicting economic and health targets can be achieved or not depends now on local governments, their motivation, and creativity.
