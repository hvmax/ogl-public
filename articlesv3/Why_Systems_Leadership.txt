This is the first in a series of weekly articles on systems leadership that will appearOn Global Leadershipfrom Sara Beckman and David Slocum. Linear versus non-linear thinking and causality is just one of the contrasts that helps us to illuminate systems thinking. Each of our upcoming postings will explore and unpack different dimensions of systems leadership today. -- The OGL Editorial Team

In September 2019, the World Economic Forum (WEF) responded to a gathering of leaders and activists at the United Nations in New York by calling for the transformation of large-scale systems, like those around energy, health, and food. To drive that transformation, it proposedsystems leadership, which it defined as “a set of skills and capacities that any individual or organization can use to catalyze, enable and support the process of systems-level change.” The WEFsummary reportacknowledged that this approach was hardly new: it dates back, at least, to the emergence of general systems theory around varied studies of biological, sociological, linguistic, and ecological systems in the 1940s and 1950s, and to the founding of systems dynamics by computer engineer Jay Wright Forrester in the 1960s.
More familiar to many people today is the work ofPeter Sengeand others on the use of systems thinking in business leadership and organizational learning in the 1990s and early 2000s. While the WEF’s general imperative to embrace systems leadership to confront complex, dynamic, and global challenges is laudable, its explicit emphasis on this form of leadership at the level of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is too limiting. Systems leadership as an alternative practice of thinking, inquiry, and viewing the world has vital applications to smaller scale but still complex, collaborative, and dynamic team and organizational systems.
A quick consult with your daily news feed surfaces any number of systems problems. Mark Zuckerberg (and his Big Tech CEO peers) testifying before the U.S. Congress revealed the complex dynamics of running a company that thrives on a virtuous cycle of an ever-expanding database and providing increasingly targeted ads to satisfy advertiser demand; yet at the same time strives to grow user activity and to maintain consumer trust through a promise of privacy and respect. Facebook and other social platforms are particularly helpful in illustrating systems dynamics (nicely depicted in the documentaryThe Social Dilemma) because, by definition as social networks, their operations rely on social interactions and inter-dependencies and produce complex outcomes, intended and unintended, and adaptation. Managing that complexity and multidimensionality is incongruent with the more traditional, top-down leadership that is marked by a singular vision and fixed objectives.
Alternatively, consider the potential outcomes that might result from simply putting a new technology into the market. (AnyBlack Mirrorfans out there?) Take autonomous vehicles. What are the implications of their wide adoption in the market? Fewer jobs for drivers, increased productivity for commuters, and different traffic management systems are some of the obvious implications. Increased safety resulting in fewer deaths also seem obvious, but the follow-on implication of fewer organ donations less so. Reduced car ownership will lead to less real estate dedicated to consumer-facing repair shops and garages or parking lots, which opens the possibility that people can live closer to their work. As companies like Tesla produce (nearly) self-driving cars, who is responsible for considering the many systems’ impacts of their adoption?
In less futuristic thinking, consider the significant systems changes wrought by the 2020 coronavirus pandemic. Fromredesigning the toilet paper supply chainto rethinking how and to whom we deliver education, the systems in which we live and work are undergoing radical transformation. When sociologist and media analystZeynep Tukeckiwrote in late March about early efforts to address the threat of the COVID-19 pandemic, she pointed to the failure of American policymakers (and journalists) to recognize the potential connections between what erupted in Wuhan and risks to those in the United States. For some readers, this might call to mind “The Butterfly Effect,” the metaphor developed by meteorologist Edward N. Lorenz to describe how seemingly minor factors, like the flap of a butterfly’s wings, are inter-connected in ways that could alter the course of major systems, like weather fronts that produce a tornado.
At the heart of Tufecki’s analysis is a crucial contrast in our ways of thinking about complex systems, like that of the pandemic. Linear thinking leads us to focus onfixingsystems, assigning blame, trying to control chaos to create order, and ultimately believing that organizations can be predictable and orderly. As Tufecki writes, linear thinking and interactions seek to produce more efficiencies, eliminate redundancies, and increase resilience. Linear thinking is exemplified by the “straight-line view” inFigure 1that captures a simplistic view of a social media enterprise that makes money by selling advertising. In that simple view, the more users the company attracts to its platform, and the more data it gets from each user, the more it can closely target ads and thus the more ads it can sell. Linear thinking patterns are long entrenched in both our education systems and in industry practice. They also tend to align with linear explanations and narratives that predominate in popular media and entertainment. Yet linear or asystemic thinking does not serve us well as we take on the large-scale and complex systems that confront us today.
Systems thinking, conversely, asks us to appreciate the whole and seeks to discover underlying dynamics that lead to a problem. It seeks to find patterns in chaos and understanding that organizations are unpredictable in a chaotic environment. Efficiencies, redundancies, and resilience also exist here but “they pull in different directions.” InFigure 2, we see a more nuanced view of the dynamics in that social media company. Here trust, privacy, and possible disruption by an external enterprise come into play. A systems view – that includes far more variables than shown in this simple example – might, for example, assist regulators in better understanding how and where it might be expedient to interfere to shift the outcomes of this system.
In short, systems thinking adopts non-linear and more nuanced understanding that appreciates the many interactions in a system. As Senge wrote, it is “the art of seeing the forestandthe trees.” Yes, many leaders who adopt this approach at first decry what appears to be a significant increase in the complexity of their situations. Once reminded that they already live in that world of complexity, and that systems thinking yields deeper understanding than the linear views they previously held, they are converts. In Tufecki’s recent analysis of early U.S. COVID responses, she observes that the wider potential impact of the virus fell outside the focused linear thinking of many policymakers and journalists. They were not aware of such potential nonlinear dynamics as: tipping points (how far will contract tracing take us toward significant reductions in privacy?); phase transitions (will restaurants continue to offer outside dining experiences into the foreseeable future?); and cascades and avalanches (will the “small changes” to remote learning trigger large-scale changes in how education is delivered?).
Systems thinking is more than a gathering of multiple perspectives or a simplistic extension of a linear view to specify longer-term or adjacent causes and implications. The systems ways of viewing and thinking about the world are fundamentally different. For leaders, systems thinking can be challenging because it requires recognizing the primacy of relationships, feedback loops, and patterns rather than single actors, linear explanations, and isolated events in understanding the world and ourselves. That is, it is a way of seeing and thinking that embraces complexity rather than relying on the reductive simplicity preferred by contemporary media, markets, and public discourse.
Yet systems thinking also affords important opportunities. These include understanding issues and contexts more deeply, appreciating that processes and interactions are ongoing, and re-framing problems to generate fresh insights, perspectives, and solutions. By adopting and practicing systems leadership, all individuals can better engage and thrive in uncertain and dynamic environments.
Next, we will unpack the Great Man Myth of leadership.
