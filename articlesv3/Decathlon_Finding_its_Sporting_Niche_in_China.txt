### Decathlon: Finding its Sporting Niche in China

3 August 2023|China, Economic Development
AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy and, in particular, life in China. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. We have written about economic development in China and China’s economic reforms, U.S.-China relations, China’s changing role in the global political economy, and the history and current state of Chinese politics. In this post, we look at French sporting goods retailer Decathlon and its success in China, examining how it has managed to survive when other retailers have failed.
French sporting goods retailer Decathlon has carved out a niche in China that allows it to best many of its western competitors in retail sales there while also looking for advantages that will ensure its dominance in the future, including employing artificial intelligence (AI) and advanced analytics to better meet the needs of consumers.
Founded in 1976, Decathlon is one of the world’s largest sporting goods retailers. It operated in some 70 countries, had more than 1,750 stores and had net sales of EUR 15.4 billion in 2022. With 200 outlets across 84 major cities in China (1), Decathlon has thrived and now offers equipment and clothing suitable for more than 80 sports.
Decathlon started sourcing products from China in 1992. By 2003, the company opened its first China store in Shanghai (its first brick-and-mortar store in all of Asia) and relocated its Asia headquarters (including manufacturing and retail) from Hong Kong to Shanghai. Today, China is the company’s second-largest market.
In 2004, under China’s World Trade Organization (WTO) entry agreement, foreign investors were permitted to establish retail enterprises in China without geographic and ownership restrictions. Some critics at that time predicted that within five years after the opening up its retail sector, 60% of China domestic retail market would be controlled by three to five foreign retail giants, and local retailers would suffer greatly.
After almost 20 years, the actual situation is just the opposite (Figure 1), China has become a dead zone for some of the most renowned international retailers, including American powerhouses such as Walmart and Home Depot. While many overseas retailers have found it difficult to attract Chinese consumers, and to keep stores open, Decathlon has thrived in China.
Decathlon’s Secret Weapons
Early on, Decathlon pledged to “make sports accessible to all” in its Chinese messaging, and it seems to have worked. There is a saying on social media today that in China, “women love Disney, men love Decathlon”. While Decathlon may have been able to decode the messaging, it’s real success in China is due to three key approaches: experiential marketing, cost-effective products and full product line.
Experiential marketing.Decathlon places special emphasis on providing consumers with real offline experiences. The focus of its store design is to encourage everyone who walks into the store to have a good time, feeling the sporting spirit rather than just being pitched goods. China, in general, lacks public sports facilities, even in metropolitans such as Beijing and Shanghai. Decathlon created an ecosystem that fosters a sporting culture in its local communities and fills the gap in trials. Decathlon has expanded its main customer base to young families, sports enthusiasts and especially young middle class women with a fitness mindset.
The average size of a Decathlon store in China is about 4,000 square meters, with 15% of its indoor floor area allocated for customers to experience products in the store. The merchandise display is divided into sports such as cycling, swimming, skateboarding, sailing, camping and hiking, and people are encouraged to try their products right in the store. A main target group for sales messaging is beginners in a sport, with the hope of converting them into lifetime customers.
The store hires associates with sports expertise as sales representatives, who are experienced in giving advice in the store. Through many entry-level products and coaching, people get their "first" feel for a new sport at the Decathlon.After wandering through a store for several hours, even people who don’t exercise are often inspired to buy something. What's more, many times because of Decathlon’s restraint in pricing, it doesn't cost much to load up an entire shopping basket.
Decathlon China also recently organized the campaign, Sport to Paris, along with the French Embassy in Beijing and related French consulates in China. The event, which was held in seven cities including Shenzhen, Beijing and Shanghai, demonstrated the health benefits of traditional and emerging sports such as paddle boarding, badminton, running, balance biking, skateboarding, cycling and hiking.
Additionally, Decathlon is using data analytics to track its customer base, and because it understands the customer lifecycle, it can serve customers by cross- and up-selling other products. For example, if one of its active customers buys a bicycle, the company will send out alerts to customers when the bike might need maintenance.
“Spamming the member base with irrelevant content is no longer acceptable,” said Decathlon CEO Marc Zielinski told McKinsey& Company in aDecember 2022 interview. “People nowadays expect personalized content that is relevant or useful for the repair or maintenance of their products.”
Cost-effectiveness.Chinese consumers have high-quality expectations when it comes to Western brands, which are also commonly associated with premium prices and quality. Decathlon understands good-enough products for everyday consumer is where the money is, so the cost-effectiveness of its merchandise has been unanimously recognized.
At Decathlon, for less than ￥1,000 or US$140, a novice hiker can purchase a full range of gear such asa camouflage hat, quick-drying suit, waterproof storm suit, waterproof pants, backpack, trekking pole. etc. For other well-known outdoor sports brands, $140 may not be enough purchase one storm jacket. Importantly, Decathlon’s low price tag does not come with a decrease in quality. In order to fulfill its vision to “make sports accessible to all”, Decathlon has to make sure its products are reliable, affordable and accessible to the general public.
How does Decathlon cut costs without compromising on the quality?A no-frills approach that removes non-essential features from a product or service to keep the price low. Decathlon is a model for implementing this strategy crosses all lines.
Its product development philosophy is to focus on product performance. A typical example is that Decathlon does not provide shoe boxes, customers have to walk out of a store carrying a pair of shoes unless they pay for a shopping bag. The incremental cost is not only the box itself, but also the transportation cost, shelf space, and sales labor cost.
Ninety-five percent of Decathlon's sales come from its private label products such as QUECHUA, KALENGI, DOMYOS,etc.-- most of which cannot even be pronounced by a shopper. But it doesn't matter, as long as they are from Decathlon. In addition, simple store decoration, self-check-out kiosks, and strictly controlled marketing expenses (about 1% of revenue) all help bring retail price down.
This is Decathlon’s brand equates to success and profitability: For more professional brands, Decathlon is cheaper; for cheaper brands, Decathlon is more professional.
Full product line.In an homage to the decathlon, an all-around, 10-event ironman contest, Decathlon the company has kept its competitive advantage as a destination because of the wide range of products under one roof, and it’s done this as the competition has grown significantly in sports retailing in China.Decathlon offers products for sports adapted to all levels - beginners, intermediate and professional, which far exceeds its competitors, even for less popular sports like archery, darts, equestrian, surfing, etc.
Coming to a new sport, consumers usually do not know much about the brands or have much knowledge in that specific field. Deep and wide assortments, friendly prices and professional coaching make Decathlon an ideal place to get started.
Within a product category, one can see various assortment strategies. In a category like Hike & Camp, there is substantial product depth in shoes, jackets or tents, which can serve more specific customer needs. In a category like swimming, a lot of accessories are offered in addition to swimwear (Figure 6). A consumer may just want to buy swimwear, he/she will also see swimming caps, goggles, nose clips, chlorine-free shower gels, quick-drying towels, sunscreen sprays. It also offers a number of peripheral accessories, even the needs that consumers do not expect have been considered.
In recent years, outdoor sports are getting more and more popular in China because travel and outdoor life have become part of everyday life for the middle class. Decathlon has followed the changes in lifestyle and consumer behavior. In camping equipment, there are both entry-level and professional products. Hiking sales consultants make recommendations according to the customer's situation, from short-distance trekking gear to long-distance gear for mature players.
With clear product information and varieties, consumers know where their money could go and what they are missing. They often make additional purchases of peripheral products or choose higher-priced items with better performance or features.
Failure in the United States
Decathlon has done well in China, but it failed miserably in the United States, twice. The second failure may have had as much to do with the pandemic when Decathlon closed its final two stores in March 2022.
“We are changing our business model to adapt to current market conditions and to better meet the needs of our customers,” Christian Ollier, CEO, Decathlon USA, said at the time.
“While we will be closing physical stores at this time, our products are available online at Decathlon.com and at a growing number of retail partners. We are committed to making sports and the outdoors more accessible with quality, affordable products."
Decathlon shifted its strategy from bricks-and-mortar to online. Many of its products are also be available at select retail partners such as Walmart, Curated, Target and other third-party outlets.
An Even Bolder Future
The emergence of the customer-to-manufacturer (C2M) market in China is one that Decathlon hopes to master, but it is not a Decathlon phenomenon alone as others are fully investing in it. Decathlon developed a business-to-consumer (B2C) e-commerce warehouse solution during the COVID-19 pandemic that has allowed it to rethink its supply chain.
“Until now, we would have said we are a mass market retailer, but in China, AI and advanced analytics are enabling mass customization, said Zielinski. “Their adoption is also driving the emergence of customer to manufacturer (C2M) market models, in which the customer can bypass logistics and distribution to purchase tailored products directly from the retailer.”
Already, Decathlon's customers can personalize their own products in the store, such as adding their names to sports jerseys, before they purchase them.
In China, data is increasingly impacting the creation of new product categories and product designs. Decathlon no longer relies on instinct to anticipate trends. Partners such as e-commerce platforms provide the company with great feedback and insight that it uses to develop new categories or new products, said Zielinski.
In addition, customers are no longer prepared to wait weeks to receive personalized products. New types of factories, incorporating AI and analytics, are acting as anchors in the data-informed value chains, allowing customers to receive personalized products within a very short turnaround time, Zielinski said. The emergence of customer to manufacturer (C2M) market models, in which the customer can bypass logistics and distribution to purchase tailored products directly from the retailer, is already revolutionizing the future of retail in China.
“In China, our customers increasingly want their dream product now, on-demand,” said Zielinski. “That means that we have to adapt the whole value chain in order to be there wherever and whenever the customer needs us.”
China's sports market has a different development trajectory: 40 years ago, for ordinary people, sports meant watching competitive sports on TV; by 2030, more than 40% of the population will regularly participate in physical exercise. While sports have gained more and more popularity among ordinary people, they have also become diversified and personalized - people choose sports according to their own situation and interests.
There is no doubt that China's huge and potential consumer sports market has a bright future.The most recent 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-25) estimated that the total production value of China's sports industry is expected to reach 5 trillion yuan ($726.8 billion) by 2025, with sports consumption exceeding 2.8 trillion yuan.
Since entering China, Decathlon has been introducing and refining targeted products and services, and encouraging consumers to experience the fun of sports. Decathlon is a retailer and a producer, as well as a sports authority and coach. For 20 years, although its development path has been far from smooth, the French retailer has maintained its benchmark position in China and looks to continue its success moving forward.
1. On the Decathlon website, there are 293 stores in 113 cities as of July 7, 2023. We believe this number is not updated as Decathlon has closed some less profitable stores in 2022 and 2023.
