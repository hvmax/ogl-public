On Global Leadership’s team of advisors includes a number of respected analysts in China, and we have periodically featured their musings and insights as they have lived through the experience of COVID-19 quarantines and city-wide shutdowns. This latest installment comes from Chris Gao as he thinks about his Shanghai experience watching the most recent popular movie about Shanghai. -- The OGL Editorial Team
The Shanghainese have waited a generation for a film to be produced in their local dialect. The release ofB for Busy(爱情神话) marked the end of that wait, and the movie has been met with broad enthusiasm in Shanghai. The romantic comedy has rapidly achieved mythical status in the Shanghai film market over the past New Year holiday. It has dominated the box office and movie attendance rates. Forty percent of the total box office in China comes from Shanghai, and, so far, one out of every 10 residents in Shanghai (more than 2 million) have watched the film. Needless to say, it is a tremendous hit. (Watch the trailer here.)
B for Busyis about a special group of Shanghainese living in an old neighborhood best representing the city's international temperament. For those who don’t know Shanghai’s history, for many years, before the Communist Revolution, Shanghai was China’s most international city. The French Concession, the Bund, these were places heavily influenced by foreign visitors and residents.
In the movie, the leading character, Mr. Bai, is a Shanghai uncle (middle-aged man) and painter who is divorced and makes his living by teaching people to paint in his house. Ms. Li is a white-collar worker, and she and her daughter return to live with her mother after divorcing her British husband. Bai’s ex-wife Beibei, who is still favored by her ex-mother-in-law, is now obsessed with the tango. Gloria, who likens herself to a street cat, is a student in Bai’s painting class; she is wealthy and free, and, what’s more, her Taiwanese husband has gone missing. These are the three main female characters, and they've become acquainted because of Bai.
Additionally, Lao Wu, Bai’s witty French-speaking neighbor and best friend, brags to Bai about his romance in Europe many years ago. These five people are all middle-aged and middle class. Their encounters in the film have satisfied many people’s image of Shanghai -- a gentle, meticulous, tolerant, and, most important, a place for a life with tact. Such detailed depictions of a city has been compared to director Woody Allen’s movies that are infused with his passion for cities, includingManhattan,Midnight in Paris,andLove in Rome.
What is attracting viewers most is the film’s petite bourgeoisie style -- little love affairs, trivial entanglements, and witty conversations. The vast majority of the film's dialogue (perhaps 95%) is in the Shanghai dialect, which creates authenticity. It almost feels like a documentary.
The characters are neither new Shanghainese working “996” (1), nor the filthy rich in theTiny Times(2). The characters attend art exhibitions, see plays, drink coffee, and enjoy cooking at home. All of these roles, especially the women in the film, are independent and confident. They have deep internal motivations for their lives, although each has pain and suffering under their pleasant surfaces. Such refreshing and soothing parts of life are indeed the experiences for which many filmgoers yearn.
Some Chinese reviewers sayB for Busyis shallow. Its structure is a bit flat and the plot is somewhat loose. Because of its genre and/or dialogue in Shanghai dialect, it is a film that will likely not build too far beyond Shanghai or go global. The film is shot in the French Concession, and Shanghai itself is another character in the film. Additionally, the Shanghainese viewers get the nuanced references -- spoken and unspoken. But the question remains: What will ultimately resonate with Shanghai viewers as well as small-town viewers in China or potential viewers around the world?
What makes the film especially current, and some would say popular, is its willingness to tackle taboo topics, and traditional views of men and women and their relationships. The film also explores the empowerment of women in society. For example, central character Beibei says at one point, "I just did something any man in the world could have done. A man can be forgiven for cheating, but I’d done once and you divorced me?"
From its December 24, 2021 release to January 8, 2022, total box office for the film in mainland China exceeded ￥200 million ($31.4million), not that significant compared to the ￥47.258 billion（$7.42 billion) total box office sales of mainland China. However,B for Busyexcels in capturing its target audiences and genre, and the film is regarded as one of the best on social media among all Chinese films released in 2021.
Many critics think thatB for Busyis a feminist film. This is not a surprise if you see the writer-director Shao Yihui use the photo of RBG, the late U.S. Supreme Court Justice, as her personal Weibo portrait. (See Figure 5.)
Shao was born in Taiyuan, a city in northern China. After graduating from the Beijing Film Academy, Shao came to Shanghai and stayed for six years.B for Busyis her debut, inspired by her experience in Shanghai. In 2019, Shao completed the script when she was a freelance writer as well as an e-cigarette seller.
The English title of her script  was originally called “Myth of Love,” and was meant to be an homage to Fellini'sSatyricon. In August 2020, after several failed attempts, Shao finally found an investor at a film venture capital conference at the FIRST Film Festival.Myth of Lovewas one of 673 film scripts submitted. She won, including a small budget of $5 million. Xu Zheng, a Shanghai-born actor known for excelling in hilarious comedies, was so touched by the script that he became the film’s producer and protagonist. The filming started in March 2021 and completed in 50 days. Although the total investment has never been revealed, there is no doubt thatB for Busyis quite profitable.
Shao knows that it is her film and about her uniquely Shanghai experience. Making her first film purely in a local dialect, Shao has created her own appealing myth. It is not necessary for a successful Chinese film to be profound and to please all audiences. The film market in China accommodates both commercial blockbusters and small productions. Chinese society is diversified, and moviegoers like to have choices likeB for Busy,and there are just too few of films like this one.
Now thatB for Busyhas become a phenomenon, a celebrated representation of Shanghai culture. Many wish Shao to repeat the success ofB for Busyin creating her next film and telling her next story. As for now, she has given younger filmmakers at least one piece of good advice: “Attend film venture capital conferences”.
