### Solutionmaking: The Systems Leader’s Complement to Sensemaking

10 May 2023|Leadership, Organizational systems, Systems Leadership
This is the seventh piece in a multi-part On Global Leadership series on Systems Leadership. The previous post explored the human relationship that enable the Systems Leader to guide project, teams and organizational work. In particular, that piece focused on three key sets of principles and behaviors that shape and drive those relationships and the Selfmaking they foster: Emotional Intelligence, Navigating Mindsets, and Systems Thinking. In this entry, we turn to the critical and active work of experimentation that takes the observation and framing and reframing of Sensemaking and finds its way to implement change. Complementing Sensemaking, we refer to these dynamic and active processes of working toward solutions or pursuing other opportunities as Solutionmaking. -- The OGL Editors

We have been constructing a model of Systems Leadership grounded in an understanding of leaders that moves beyond the Great Man Myth to a more collective and inclusive view of leadership. That model connects leadership teams with others and situations with which they interact in varying contexts and environments. In the process, we have spoken to two crucial activities -- selfmaking and sensemaking -- in which leaders participate. Selfmaking comprises the ongoing actions of leaders and others to engage in new and revised behaviors, paying attention to how others think and feel, adapt to situations, contexts, and the broader environment, and invoke introspection to deepen understanding of their evolving selves. Selfmaking is in turn a cornerstone of sensemaking, as leaders’ ability to take in what is happening around them, find patterns in the messiness, and extract what is most important, relies on surfacing deeply held assumptions of self and others that can affect that process.
In this post, we turn to an activity complementary to sensemaking that we will callsolutionmaking. While sensemaking unearths new perspectives and points of view, creating new opportunity spaces, solutionmaking takes those new perspectives, generates ideas for leveraging them, and then iteratively experiments to learn which perspectives and opportunity spaces are most useful, and which ideas best support them. Thus, we are turning our attention from the reflective work of observing and making sense of conditions and possibilities to the more active work of experimenting with and ultimately implementing change.
Before we describe solutionmaking in more detail, it is worth emphasizing something that we have brought up in prior posts: leaders rarely, if ever, work alone. Instead leaders frequently work as teams: Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak (Apple); Larry Page, Sergey Brin and Eric Schmidt (Google); Jerry Yang and David Filo (Yahoo!); Mike Lazaridis and James Balsillie (RIM); Masaru Ibuka and Akio Morita (Sony). In fact,“Senior leadership teams whose members play complementary roles have been chronicled as far back as Homer’s oral history of the Trojan War.”
Moreover, many of the insights from recent research on theadvantages of well-orchestrated teams being generally more successful than would be the sum of the efforts of their individual members-- more productive, creative, satisfied and happy -- also apply directly to senior leadership teams.Some of that researchconfirms the further advantages of diverse teams, particularly for innovation and other creative tasks. Regrettably, it is conspicuous how few women leadership teams exist and, when women and others from underrepresented groups are in senior leadership teams, that they are not often in the top position.
One type of complementarity found in senior leadership teams is cognitive complementarity which distinguishes leaders by how they process information.“It is extraordinarily rare...to find leaders who are equally good at dealing with the big picture—creating and communicating compelling visions and crafting breakthrough strategies—and at driving execution through an intense focus on tactics, details, and follow-through.”This cognitive diversity parallels the functional differences that Deborah Ancona cited -- ‘sensemaking,’ ‘relating’ (to others), ‘visioning,’ and ‘inventing’ -- when she, Peter Senge, and others wrote, “In Praise of the Incomplete Leader,” and called for leaders with these distinct skills to work together. In our framing, some leaders may excel at sensemaking while others excel at solutionmaking. As we unpack solutionmaking -- which involves designing, experimenting and implementing -- in this post, it is worth keeping in mind that an individual leader may not excel at both sensemaking and solutionmaking. More likely, a pair or team of leaders will collectively display these capabilities.
The need for leadership teams to engage both sensemaking and solutionmaking will become apparent as we flesh out and compare the two. In previous posts we have described the toggle in which leaders move between the dance floor and balcony as they engage in sensemaking and selfmaking. They immerse themselves among others in a variety of situations on the dance floor to observe, notice, and experience the dynamics of the organization they are leading. Similarly, they scan the external environment watching customers, competitors, complementors, and the general dynamics of the broader system in which their organization operates. Interspersed with the concrete experiences of the dance floor are visits to the balcony where leaders engage in abstract conceptualization, finding patterns in the observations they have made, seeking insights from having adopted alternative perspectives on the challenges facing their organizations, and identifying alternative frames for conceptualizing future directions.
David Teece, well-known for developing theory around dynamic capabilities as a source of corporate agility, includes sensing as one of three primary capabilities required for firms to readily adapt to changing conditions. Sensing, Teece says,“is an inherently entrepreneurial set of capabilities that involves exploring technological opportunities, probing markets and listening to customers, along with scanning the other elements of the business ecosystem.”Sensing leverages managerial insight and vision, analytical processes, and the dance floor-balcony toggle.Kathleen Eisenhardt’sempirical research on strategic decision-making highlights the importance of sensemaking:“The greater the use of real-time information, the greater the speed of the strategic decision process.”
Sensing, however, is just one of the three dynamic capabilities Teece identifies. In his terms, leaders must also engage in seizing in which they mobilize resources to address an opportunity and to capture value from doing so, and transforming or continued renewal. Seizing, according to Teece, involves designing business models to satisfy customers and achieving value, securing access to capital and necessary human resources, motivating employees, and forging strong relationships with suppliers, complementors, and customers. Transforming requires facilitating an ongoing process of maintaining alignment between firm and ecosystem, structure and strategy and assets with one another. It requires paying attention to the rigidities that can develop over time in an organization through asset accumulation and standard operating procedure accretion and adjusting firm assets, tangible and intangible, to increase flexibility.
Just as sensemaking requires toggling between the dance floor and balcony, so do seizing and transforming. The sensemaking toggle focuses on identifying opportunities, while the seizing toggle -- or what we will callsolutionmaking-- engages inactive experimentationleading to the implementation of change. While in the balcony during solutionmaking, leaders imagine and design alternative futures for the ecosystem in which they are operating, for their organization’s position in that ecosystem, or for how their organization is best structured to acquire that position. Importantly, leaders sink themselves into the possible new frames generated in the sensemaking process, and by fully bringing those frames alive in the solutionmaking process can see alternatives that question or topple existing assumptions about how their companies, the industry, or more generally businesses work.
In 2001, Steve Jobs announced a “musical revolution”. He identified observed consumer behaviors -- ripping CDs, capturing music electronically on their computers, creating their own playlists -- and a resulting opportunity to restructure the industry. While others might have seen the same opportunity, they likely bemoaned the use of digital rights management (DRM) and other seemingly rigid standards of the industry. Instead, Jobs lived into the possibility that consumers might purchase and manage music as they liked, creating iTunes and the iPod and setting up that “musical revolution.” Jobs engaged in sensemaking to understand customers as well as the dynamics of the music industry, surfacing the possibility of making the customer experience much better. He then turned to solutionmaking, generating along with his design team a range of options for revolutionizing how people consume music and then experimenting with those ideas. It was only after the iTunes store was opened that iPod sales took off. Even after the success of these products, the conversation about DRM continued with Jobsimagining alternative options for further restructuring of the industry.
Literature on designerly thinking (as distinct from the management construct of design thinking) speaks to the role of design in bridging the sensemaking work of identifying opportunities and the solutionmaking work of imagining alternative futures. Design, it argues, is the “maximum expression of human intelligence and the prototypical case of cognition, as it requires devising future states of the world (goals), recognizing current ones (initial states) and finding paths to bridge both (transformation functions). Moreover, it requires the generation of external representations of such states and paths” (Restrepo and Christiaans 2004, p.220). This description captures the essence of Jobs’ strategic leadership and of his facility in toggling between sensemaking and solutionmaking.
To imagine alternative futures, leaders and their teams manage the dynamic balance of diverging and converging. The management literature suggests that divergent approaches in organizations tend to rely on“technologies of foolishness” (March 1979), while convergent processes are more grounded in technologies of reason (Oliver, Heracleous, and Jacobs 2014). Eisenhardt’s research on speedy strategic decision-making adds:“The greater the number of alternatives considered simultaneously, the greater the speed of the strategic decision process.”Marco Iansiti’s researchon product development in the semiconductor industry similarly supports the notion of keeping options alive as long as possible so as to enhance learning and thus inform future choice making.
Hybrid management approaches that balance diverging and converging include: scenario planning (Schoemaker 1995); strategic thinking (rather than strategic planning) – balancing exploration of big picture, long term trends with organizational realities and feasibility; serious play–building models of various sorts; using analogic reasoning; constructing narrative-based outputs; and integrating diverse considerations and evaluations (Oliver, Heracleous, and Jacobs 2014). Building on systems theory and speculative design practices,transition designis an emergent field focused on first imagining transitions to sustainable futures and then enacting systems-level change (Irwin 2015). In short, the ability to envision and speculate about potential futures is seen as a key component in bringing potential change to fruition. This work of imagining alternative futures is largely balcony work. At some point, leaders must return to the dance floor to experiment with and test their ideas.
Solutionmaking, in its toggle between dance floor and balcony, consists of trial and error directed by some insight as to the direction in which a solution might lie. In his classic work,The Sciences of the Artificial, Herbert Simon proposed that the design process be seen as a highly iterative process of generating and testing alternatives. Subsequent research has shown that learning and improvement in organizations come primarily from the errors encountered through trying new policies, technologies, or behaviors (Tyre and Von Hippel 1997).  In his recent book,Experimentation Works: The Surprising Power of Business Experiments, Stefan Thomke emphasizes the importance of cultivating rapid experimentation capabilities that allow the organization to test changes to customer experiences, new business models, and product designs. This and other research highlights the importance of early identification of the riskiest assumptions associated with an idea and creative design of experiments to test and reduce those risks.
Somewhat ironically, many organizations underinvest in the critical dance floor activity of experimentation due to industry and corporate norms associated with failure and punishment. This often results in more conservative choices about the alternative futures to be pursued or in lack of acknowledgment of known risks early enough to do something about them. The long-term price these organizations pay in lost revenue from opportunities foregone or in overspending on risky ventures that could have been de-risked can be significant.Risk taking is critical to improving competitive advantage and performance of a firm, so what stands in the way?
Research on entrepreneurship in Singapore revealed three primary dimensions of fear of failure: financial consequences for self and others; psychological consequences and status concerns; and career consequences (Chua and Bedford, 2016). A more general study of performance failure identified experiencing shame and embarrassment, devaluing one’s self-estimate, having an uncertain future, important others losing interest, and upsetting important others as core elements of fear of failure (Conroy, Willow and Metzler, 2010). Selfmaking thus becomes an important part of engaging in solutionmaking, as leaders and the others with whom they work must recognize their own predilection for risk-taking, the extent to which it affects their choices, and the possibilities for reframing how they view it. Imagining possibilities for de-risking ideas through experimentation, through engaging on the dance floor in small probes or tests, provides a different frame through which to think about and take on risk.
In their bookCreative Confidence, design firm IDEO leaders (and brothers) Tom and David Kelley include a chapter called "Dare: Fear to Courage"in which they address what they call the “failure paradox”. As with the Great Man Myth we described in an earlier post, we have commonly held notions that creative geniuses rarely fail. Quite the opposite is true: creative people are “quite prolific when it comes to failure -- they just don’t let it stop them.” Instead, creative people “simply do more experiments”, they “take more shots at the goals”, and in the process they learn to “shrug off more failures”. Among other recommendations the Kelleys make is to employ “urgent optimism” akin to that video gamers often display as they hold onto “reasonable hope of success” while running into walls, being “offed” by a competing player or making the wrong guess as to which artifact will best help them unlock hidden treasure.
Thus, we argue, Systems Leader teams must be adept at selfmaking, sensemaking, and solutionmaking, all requiring knowing when and how to toggle between the dance floor and balcony. Let’s revisit the story of Kim Malek and her cousin Tyler Malek ofSalt & Straw, and their runaway ice cream shop success. The impetus for their original ice cream cart was Kim’s long-held desire to create a community gathering place where you might run into neighbors, spend time with family, or treat yourself. The depth of Kim Malek'ssense of community is exemplified in her personal life and how she makes time to be present, for example, with the other parents and teachers at her kids’ school. Her understanding of what mattered most to her drove her, in interaction with others, to establish and execute the core vision for Salt & Straw. That awareness of self and ability to translate it to others is an example of selfmaking.
With no knowledge about making ice cream, the Maleks launched intensive rounds of sensemaking and solutionmaking. They went out into the community and talked with local chefs and farmers to learn about making ice cream, ultimately designing unique ice cream flavors (Pear and Blue Cheese or Arbequina Olive Oil, anyone?). In short, they did sensemaking.  Tyler Malek invested in some used ice cream makers and started playing around with making ice cream, testing a variety of options. Kim Malek cashed in her savings and bought a cart that allowed them to make and sell their ice cream at small scale and see what interested the market.  They imagined, designed, and tested dozens of flavor options and delivery methods -- solutionmaking.
Their ready toggle between sensemaking and solutionmaking continued as they went out into the world to learn about producing ice cream at scale and then broke the rules of mass production, experimenting with a variety of methods for producing small batches of ever-changing flavors at relatively low cost. The pandemic tested them once again, and they returned to the dance floor-balcony, sensemaking-solutionmaking toggle to figure out how they might still supply customers with ice cream, retain as many employees as possible, and adjust their store experience. No doubt, their agility in that toggle is what has allowed them to survive.
Agility and learning through experimentation most obviously yields distinctive ice cream products and services, happy customers, committed suppliers, and a successful business. Yet it is also essential to connect their ongoing sensemaking and solutionmaking to two other key aspects of Systems Leadership discussed in this series. The first, as examined in ourprevious post, concerns relationships. Salt & Straw’s design and testing works because it is more than an abstract model or fixed process; it is animated and shaped by the trust, common embrace of the company’s story and values, and willingness to contribute to the wider society shared by individual persons in different areas surrounding the two leaders. The second aspect is selfmaking. Again, agility and learning about products and services, and improving them, entails having a mindset open to growth and personal change. For the Maleks and the other persons with whom they are interacting, their individual selfmaking co-evolves with the sensemaking and solutionmaking of innovative products and services that drive the business.
Systems Leaders, we argue, must understand the capabilities of selfmaking, sensemaking, and solutionmaking. They must understand themselves well enough to know where their strengths  lie in each of these capabilities, and they must formulate their leadership teams to have an appropriate balance of capabilities. There are“fundamental limits on a single person’s ability to focus attention, acquire new capabilities, process information, and play diverse social roles”. So, leadership teams must carefully consider their membership and monitor their approaches to making strategic decisions to ensure that selfmaking, sensemaking, and solutionmaking and the associated toggle between dance floor and balcony are appropriately represented.
In the next post, we describe the role of narratives in selfmaking, sensemaking, and solutionmaking and as a critical tool for Systems Leaders as they influence, collaborate, and build trust with others to create and execute strategic direction.
