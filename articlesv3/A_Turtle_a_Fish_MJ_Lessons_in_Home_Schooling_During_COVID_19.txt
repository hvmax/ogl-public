### A Turtle, a Fish & MJ: Lessons in Home Schooling During COVID-19

23 May 2020|Coronavirus, Leadership
AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy and, in particular, life in China. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. We are building a database of cities in China to better understand how jurisdictions cope with today’s economic and political forces, as well. We also have sought to push forward a conversation about what leadership in these times of crisis might mean. We have written abouteveryday leadership in the times of COVID-19, and we have written about other aspects ofleadership and “winning” at all costs.
In this post, we seek to share some thoughts about life, leadership, and family during COVID-19 in the United States. Let me explain.
When the COVID-19 pandemic hit, I was in the middle of a personal reflection period. I was trying to figure out what I would do with my life, after a career as an academic (scholar of both China and leadership), time served as an academic administrator, and then a period in the corporate sector (working for Apple in China). It was an interesting run, but this year it was time to get my family back home (and it was time for me to leave China for other reasons), so we relocated to Ann Arbor. I have been easing back into the life of a professor, but the current events that we live with today have added twists and turns in the road and opportunities to learn in unexpected ways.
As with many parents, I suddenly found myself in the role of home school teacher for my kids. This seemed like a wonderful opportunity, if only to spend more time with my children when they needed it the most. For years, I have been busy executive and university administrator, so the opportunity to spend more time with my kids seemed like a welcome moment to reflect on what is important. I have to say: being a third grade teacher (even for a short amount of time) is really hard. Being a college professor and a business school dean have their challenges; being a person who thinks about how to teach and relate to nine-year-old boys is a completely different level of difficulty and complexity. (And I’m sure it goes without saying, we should be paying our teachers exponentially more than what they are making.)
I had two experiences recently that helped me think about what this time of crisis really means, right here, right now and how kids are dealing with it. The other day, I took my kids on a nature walk – in this time of social isolation, we try to get the kids out in nature as much as possible. On this trip, we went to Barton Dam in Ann Arbor, Michigan, one of our favorite places for nature walks. As it turned out, it was a day after a dam had broken in Michigan’s thumb region and many parts of the state were experiencing severe flooding.
As we were walking around the park and got near the raging Huron River, my kids spotted a fish that had been washed up on shore. We could see it was still alive – it was trying to breathe, and air bubbles and water were squirting out of its gills. My kids’ first reaction was: “Dad, it looks like it’s breathing. Is it gonna die?” Then my youngest said: “Daddy, can we can save it? We have to save it.” So, we picked it up and threw it back into the water, and, even in the muddy water, we saw it happily swim away. I turned to the kids to see their reactions, and one of the kids (my oldest, I think) sagely said, “Nobody wants to die.” It felt like a commentary on today’s global crisis, and it was fascinating to see the kids be passion about saving a life. It also felt like it was one of my better moments as a dad. Small things.
The very next day, I was on a bike ride with my son. He is not the most coordinated biker, so I am reluctant to stop him or divert his focus while we are riding. But we came across a large tortoise trying to make it across a busy road. My son and I stopped. As we watched the cars going by, my son looked up at me and said, “Dad that guy is gonna get killed. What should we do?” We picked up the tortoise and put it back in the woods beside the road. He  started eating leaves and seemed relieved or maybe even happy to be where he was.
As we were picking up our bikes to go, someone from the other side of the highway stopped and rolled down his window and shouted: “Did you save the tortoise? Awesome! Thanks, man!” He gave us the thumbs up and a huge smile. As I looked at where his car was, I could see that he had done a U-turn to come back and save the tortoise himself. That moment just gave me a little more faith in humanity. My son wanted to save a life, and so did that guy. Again, small things in this moment of chaos.
Finally, back to our site and our focus… leadership. In an earlier post, I wrote about Michael Jordan (MJ) and how I realized that he is maybe not the Greatest of All Time (GOAT). It was an interesting piece for me to write in some unexpected ways. I wrote the piece, because I just wanted to share some thoughts about leadership in this moment in which many of us revere MJ for his win-at-all-costs approach to basketball and life. This debate about basketball’s GOAT was revived, to some degree, by the new documentary, “The Last Dance”, which so ably illustrates his prowess and ruthlessness.
My main point in the article was that winning at all costs is a dangerous approach to leadership and life. In the beauty of basketball, this type of leadership gets you Michael Jordan and the Dynasty Chicago Bulls. But you also have a leader who is known to have ridiculed, belittled, and punched teammates in the face (literally) to get them to do what he wanted them to do. There is something beyond results; things like compassion, empathy, and humanity matter. Jordan was a bully who lifted his team to championship seasons, but was he really a leader to be emulated and praised? I don’t think so.
I used to be a guy that was obsessed with being great and having an outsize impact on the world. And as I look back at that time now, I am ashamed to admit that I was kind of an asshole – I had a bit of the win-at-all-cost mentality myself. I didn't nurture friendships, I hurt people, and I didn't take care of the friendships that really mattered. I know a lot more about the cost of that kind of leadership today. Now, I think about being with my kids throughout this crisis and about their sense of mortality and compassion in the face of life’s harshest realities. And like the parents of many children, I treasure their hope in wanting to save the lives of helpless animals. Today I realize there is no way I would trade MJ’s success for these moments.
Thank you, COVID-19, for the home schooling. Thank you for helping me grow.
