### A Deeply Unserious 2024 GOP Presidential Field

AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy and, in particular, life in China. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. We have also written about thehistoryandcurrent stateof U.S.-China relations. Recently, we have written about the 50th anniversary ofPresident Nixon's visit to Chinaand how U.S.-China relations have evolved over that period (e.g.,here,here, andhere). In this post, we examine the ways in which China is being discussed by US Presidential candidates, with particular focus on Nikki Haley.
Like most U.S. viewers, we at On Global Leadership have been impatiently streaming the intrigues of the Roy family in the final season of “Succession” on Max. As the family dithered into confusion, civil war, and dissolution with the death of the patriarch, Logan Roy, his past characterization of his spoiled and narcissistic children was made plain: “you are not serious people.”
Those words came to mind this past week as we watched the Republican candidates for the U.S. presidency jockeying to see who could be the most ill-informed and misleading GOP representative on questions about geopolitics and the United States’ complex relationship with China.
Here’s a countdown of recent gaffes and miscalculations from the 2024 GOP presidential contenders that have got us worried at OGL:
No. 1:There was the mortifying gaffe by Miami Mayor Francis Suarez, who had just jumped into the race. In an interview with GOP commentator Hugh Hewitt, when the discussion turned to geopolitics and China, Suarez fell far short of what a nation might expect of a serious presidential candidate. Hewitt asked Suarez, “Will you be talking about the Uyghurs in your campaign?” Suarez seemed utterly unfamiliar with the topic, saying, “The what? What’s a Uyghur?” After further dissembling, and an admonition from Hewitt, they moved on. At the end of the interview, Suarez said: “You gave me homework, Hugh. I’ll look at… What’d you call it, a weeble?”
This could easily qualify as a funny Saturday Night Live skit illustrating the ignorance of U.S. presidential candidates, and if it had been, we all could have laughed and moved on. Instead, it was a moment where every U.S. citizen should be embarrassed. Here is an individual seeking arguably the most powerful executive position in the world, and he has never heard of the term “Uyghur.” This beleaguered Chinese ethnic group has been at the heart of U.S.-China squabbles for years, and every presidential candidate needs to know the trigger issues dominate the debate about global politics. Suarez had no idea who they were.
No. 2:In January 2023, former president and current presidential candidate Donald Trump attacked the Biden administration and China in a conspiracy-theory-laced video that said a new Trump administration would block China from buying up farmland, food supplies, natural resources, and shipping terminals. “And with the help of corrupt influence-peddlers like the Biden crime family, China is even trying to buy up the pillars of the U.S. energy industry,” Trump threatened in the video.
Alluding to a Biden crime family diminishes what could be a more serious argument about whether the U.S. needs to protect its shores from a China buying spree and the impact that would have on U.S. security. But this is the president who both cheers China as America’s greatest friend at some points and dismisses it as a Communist invader at another.
No. 3:In March 2023, Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, an entrepreneur who founded the biopharmaceutical company Roivant Sciences, called for the U.S. to issue a “Declaration of Independence” from China. “The Declaration of Independence from China is what Thomas Jefferson would’ve signed if he were alive today,” Ramaswamy wrote on Twitter.  “We are in a co-dependent relationship that will not end well. The only question is who ends it first,” he wrote in a separate post.
Ramaswamy may be right about the United States and its trade dependence on China, but he’s missing the fact that many of America's top companies use China to source the products they sell in the U.S. at a discount. Are shoppers willing to spend more for their cell phones, washers and dryers, toys, and furniture? Trade with China may not be balanced but it is a carefully curated relationship that may prove necessary to keep the U.S. economy afloat.
No. 4:This is where former United States ambassador to the United Nations and current presidential candidate Nikki Haley was supposed to be a leader in seriousness. Regardless of what one thinks of her politics, Haley does come across as articulate, intelligent, and sophisticated in her delivery of arguments on a variety of topics. Generally considered one of the more legitimate contenders in the field, her diatribe against China this past week proved less embarrassing but much more unenlightened.
In aspeechsponsored by the American Enterprise Institute, Haley, a former North Carolina governor, outlined her views on the U.S. relationship with China. She focused on a variety of issues, including explicitly condemning Chinese Communism, ending China’s Permanent Normal Trade Relations (PNTR) status, and, in effect, blaming the U.S. fentanyl crisis on China.
In her talk, Haley criticized her former boss, Donald Trump, saying, “He did not put us on a stronger military foothold in Asia. He did not stop the flow of American technology and investment into the Chinese military. He did not effectively rally our allies against the Chinese threat. Even the trade deal he signed came up short when China predictively failed to live up to its commitments” (quoted on CNN). Haley was blunt and aggressive, stating, “Communist China is the greatest threat to American security and prosperity by far”, which was considered newsworthy inThe South China Morning Post.
Haley clearly sounds more intelligent than her peers. However, the hawkish tone (some might say belligerent) is alarming to say the least. We have written extensively about the interdependencies of the U.S. and Chinese economies (see, for example,here,here,here). Moving more aggressively on China may make good political sense in the 2024 GOP primary, but ending PNTR would be a disaster for both nations’ economies, particularly the U.S. That doesn’t sound like informed and insightful thinking to us. Rather, it seems like flirting with disaster, and unleashing a level of fear and distrust that could poison U.S.-China relations for decades.
One of the special hallmarks of American politics is that any aspiring person can hold the office of President of the United States, regardless of their qualifications. Usually, some platform of experience or reputation is necessary to navigate a complex presidential contests, but many start from fairly modest beginnings. You might be a farmer, soldier, lawyer, or a shop owner like Harry Truman. You might be a college professor and university administrator like Woodrow Wilson. Or you might be a community organizer and state senator like Barack Obama. Each of these individuals came from humble backgrounds and, through their vision, dedication, and aspirations rose to the highest office in the land. They were purposeful and realistic about the world the United States must live in.
Being the chief executive of what has been the world’s most powerful nation for more than 90 years requires a bit more expertise than the average job: you should have a broad knowledge, a gift for nuance, and a deep understanding of the global stage, and the geopolitical system in which the United States plays a critical role. Quite simply, you must be a serious person.
