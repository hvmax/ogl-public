### When Walking Away is the Hardest Leadership Choice

AtOn Global Leadership, we have developed a new theory of leadership that steers away from the C-Suite, the charismatic leader approach to leading. Instead, we focus on what people do as leaders in their lives on a daily basis – every day everyone a leader.This post offers an example of such vital Everyday Leadership on the field, and in the person of U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis, R-NC, who put his career on the line in the last few weeks to oppose the president's omnibus spending bill that was moving through Congress.
Leadership is often celebrated as the art of perseverance, the act of digging in your heels when times get tough, fighting for your seat at the table, and never backing down. But sometimes the purest form of leadership is not staying. Sometimes it’s knowing when to leave.
Senator Thom Tillis, R-NC, chose to not run again for the U.S. Senate last week, making what’s described as a tough, necessary, and unfortunate decision. He quit in order to stand on principle, call out falsehoods, and shine a spotlight on a kind of leadership our society rarely applauds: principled exit.
In a culture obsessed with winning, “quitting” sounds like failure. Political careers are measured in how long one lasts, how many elections one survives. Yet the reality is that power, when held at the cost of one’s convictions, becomes hollow. If Tillis, 64, believed that remaining in the Senate meant compromising a fundamental principle or enabling policies he could not abide, then stepping down wasn’t weakness. It was courage.
At On Global Leadership, we employ the VAMI framework to explain leadership: vision, alignment, interpersonal motivation, and introspection. The Tillis vision for his world is built on a brutally honest introspection that allows him to calculate his own future and the cost to his integrity, and then make the hard decisions to preserve it.
Facing a brutal re-election campaign in 2026, and with President Trump proudly threatening to “primary” him in the GOP primary, Tillis decided it was more important to speak truth to power. He announced his decision to not run again. And then forcefully denounced the president’s pet piece of legislation that would kick millions of Americans off Medicaid and Obamacare, while also reducing food benefits for poor families. The $1 trillion in Medicaid cuts is estimated to result in at least 16 million consumers losing coverage. (The bill was signed into law by Trump on July 4.)
“In Washington over the last few years, it’s become increasingly evident that leaders who are willing to embrace bipartisanship, compromise, and demonstrate independent thinking are becoming an endangered species,“ Tillis said in a written statement.
History is dotted with examples of leaders who resigned rather than betray their conscience. British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook resigned in March 2003 over the Iraq War. American officials have stepped aside over civil rights, Vietnam, Watergate. Their departures were not acts of cowardice, but powerful statements that conscience must sometimes come before career.
Tillis has been criticized for “chickening out”, and some view his action as self-preserving more than self-sacrificing. Yes, hecouldhave remained in the race and opposed the bill while running. By stepping aside, he avoided that personal ordeal, and he removed himself as a counterweight from the Senate. The truth likely lies somewhere in between: he made a strategic tradeoff and yielded his seat to preserve his voice.
And there is a cost to such decisions. Stepping away from public office can mean sacrificing influence, relationships, and a hard-earned platform. It can mean financial uncertainty. It can invite criticism and accusations of abandoning the fight. But it can also send a message louder than any floor speech: that integrity matters more than power.
“What do I tell 663,000 people [in North Carolina] in two years or three years, when President Trump breaks his promise by pushing them off of Medicaid because the funding’s not there any more, guys?” Tillis said, referring to Trump’s 2024 campaign promise that he would protect Medicaid.
We should remember that leadership is not only about where you stand, but what you’re willing to stand for. And, sometimes, what you’re willing to leave behind. In an era when so many cling to office for the sake of power alone, a principled exit can be one of the strongest statements a leader can make.
Tillis has chosen to walk away in defense of a principle. It is a reminder that the most vital currency in public service isn’t tenure but trust. And sometimes the only way to keep that trust and not betray your constituents is to go.
