### Respect: A Roadmap for the West’s Relationship with China

12 November 2021|China, China history, Climate Change
AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy and, in particular, life in China. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. We have sought to advance a conversation about the U.S.-China relationship, and a deep understanding of local economic development in China. We have written a series about the strategic strength oflocal economic development in China’s 2nd and 3rd tier citiesandentrepreneurship in China today. We have written aboutinnovation in the Chinese economyandeconomic developmentas it relates tosocial inequality. We have also written about the historical and cultural dynamics of China’s relationship with the West (see, for example,hereand here). This post continues that conversation. – The Editorial Team
Over the last two weeks, the world has watched as powerful nations have come together to think about and discuss climate change. Chinese President Xi Jinping’s decision to not attend was widely interpreted as a recalcitrant snub – a statement that China would not be collaborating on issues of climate change.Several publicationsinterpreted this move as further evidence of China’s “decoupling” from the West. To be fair to Xi, he hasn’t left China for the last two years, a pattern that is likely tied to China’s zero-COVID policy.
An interesting silver lining came at the end of the gathering with the announcement of the US-China Joint Glasgow Declaration on Enhancing Climate Action in the 2020s. Even though  Xi is widely viewed to have snubbed the gathering, it seems like the world’s two largest economies are reaching out to each other. "It's beneficial not only to our two countries but the world as a whole that two major powers in the world, China and the U.S., shoulder special international responsibilities and obligations," Chinese special climate envoy Xie Zhenhua said at a news conference. "We need to think big and be responsible."
Importantly, with this agreement, China sent a clearmessage: “China is ready to work with the U.S. on the condition of mutual respect.” It is this last piece – why mutual respect is so important for China today – we want to focus on here. Just to be clear, respect and recognition are extremely important in Chinese diplomacy.
We have written previously about China’s injuries at the hands of the West in the 19th and 20th Centuries (see, for example,here,hereandhere). Six centuries ago, in 1424 – the early Ming Dynasty – China was, by far, the most powerful nation on the planet. At that time, China produced about one-third of the global Gross Domestic Product (GDP), and for over a millennium China had been far and away the most innovative economy in the world, producing such transformational inventions as the printing press, gun powder, the nautical compass, and paper money. China also had the world’s most powerful armada by orders of magnitude. Admiral Zheng He used to set sail on Chinese voyages that included hundreds of vessels built on maritime technology that Europe would not see for three centuries. Following the death of Emperor Yongle in 1424, China took a dramatic turn inward, just as Europe was entering its mercantilist and colonial phase of exploration.
And then there was decline. In the 16th, 17th, and 18th Centuries, China stagnated while the West sped ahead. China’s decline hit its nadir with the First Opium War (1839-41). As an aside, in my time as an American college professor, I have always been amazed how little my American college students know of this time. When we debate the questions of the fate of Hong Kong, for example, few Americans know that Hong Kong was taken from China and colonized as the result of a drug war – Britain went to war with China over the “right” to sell illegal drugs (opium) in China. Britain won the war, forced China to pay for the war through reparations, and colonized Hong Kong to control the drug trade. That war launched what the Chinese today refer to as the Century of Humiliation (百年国耻), a period that included the First Opium War, the Second Opium War, the Sino-Japanese War, the Boxer Rebellion, the fall of the Qing Dynasty, the Warlord Period, and the Rape of Nanking. It was a devastating century for China. The deep sense of embarrassment and shame China suffered at the hands of the West are widely known and often referenced including by Xi in China even today.
Things did not get much better in the early years of China’s economic reforms. While certain recognition was made about China’s opening its economy to the West (经济開放) and the normalization of US-China relations through the signing of the Shanghai Communique, Chinese leaders and citizens still felt disrespected. Let’s think about respect as it relates to being offered “a seat at the table”: In 1973, the Group of Seven (G7) was convened in an effort to pull together the world’s most powerful capitalist democracies. At the time China’s economy was in tatters, the result of the disastrous policies of the Great Leap Forward (and the ensuing famine in which tens of millions of Chinese citizens died) and, of course the Cultural Revolution and it was clearlynota capitalist democracy. So, there is no reason China would have been invited to this small club.
However, in 1997, the elites from the G7 decided they needed to expand their purview, and extended an invitation to Russia, creating what would be called the G8 (Russia would be suspended from the G8 in 2012 for the invasion of Crimea). But what about China? By 2012, when Russia was suspended from the G8, China’s economy was the second largest in the world and the group had clearly abandoned the issue of democracy as a criterion for entry. But China was never invited. Now, there was a fig leaf of sorts, as the most powerful nations in the world would create the G20, which was established in 1999 (two years after Russia was admitted to the G8). You can imagine who Chinese leaders and citizens feel about this dynamic: Despite having the second largest economy (and soon to be largest economy), China has never been invited to the inner circle. China’s sense of disrespect is understandable here.
Finally, there is the Trump era. We have written about this issue previously (here), and I will quote part of that argument now. During the Trump Administration, having Peter Navarro as the lead negotiator of trade with China was, to be blunt, a disaster: “Having Peter Navarro as a central figure in U.S.-China trade discussions has been an astounding decision. The idea that we would have as a lead negotiator with our largest trading partner a person who has written an extremely xenophobic and sensationalistic book about China – a book that is rife with inaccuracies and unsubstantiated accusations – indicates that the Trump Administration has had little interest in respectful diplomatic talks with the world’s soon-to-be largest economy. Respect and “face” matter in Chinese diplomatic relations and placing an incendiary pundit like Navarro in a lead position here sent a very clear message to China that the U.S. had little interest in working together in pursuing positive shared outcomes.”
Our hope is that President Biden will continue to be more measured in how the United States engages with China. The recent statement that, “China is ready to work with the U.S. on the condition of mutual respect,” is an important step in the right direction. Let’s hope the United States studies history, understands the importance of respect, and takes this important relationship forward. Let’s once and for all bring the world’s second most powerful economy to the table a peer, partner, and equal.
