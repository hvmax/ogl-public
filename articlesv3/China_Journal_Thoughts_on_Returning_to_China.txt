### China Journal: Thoughts on Returning to China

21 May 2024|China, China history, Chinese Culture
AtOn Global Leaderships, we seek to provide analyses about leadership in the global economy. In this post, Dr. Doug Guthrie, who is a co-founder of OGL, is continuing his series of China Journal entries. In May 2024, he returned to China to continue his research, helping his educational institution (Thunderbird School of Global Management at Arizona State University) develop its presence in China, and continuing his efforts to assist the West in better understand China today. He sets the stage for his trip to China with this first post, which will be followed by posts illuminating China's current economic success.
When I traveled to China in December 2023, it was my first trip back to China in four years. As I have written previously, China has been an inextricable part of my life since I was 19. The relationship has been very very personal. If you know me or have read my work, you probably have heard pieces of this story before. It's fair to say that my feelings for China run deep.
As I boarded the plane to Shanghai this time, I was awash with excitement and anticipation, but also a little trepidation. I was going back to the place I have built my life around. Post-COVID and China's lifting of all its travel restrictions, I could now resume a regular rhythm of visiting a place that feels so much like home to me. At least it felt like home for so many years, then there was a period of alienation and crisis, then I entered this new phase of coming back to China -- and coming back to life.
My return in May 2024, just five months after my last trip, was more pure research. And it felt so right. Despite the long, winding, egotistical journey my career has taken me on, I have finally found my way back home – home to the adopted homeland I fell in love with so many years ago, and home to my true identity as a researcher, a collector of deep, on-the-ground knowledge.
Deep Research is More Than Numbers: Guerilla Interviewing and Fun
Sometimes there is just joy in fitting in. When I climbed in the cab on my way from the Pudong airport to my Shanghai home this visit, the Kempinski hotel, I started chatting with my driver. I always like talking to cab drivers, as it gets me in the mindset of ethnographic interviewing. At some point, the driver said to me, “What country are you from?” I reply, “What country do you think I am from?” This answer has become common for me lately, as I often feel an impulse to hide the fact that I am American. Things are tense enough between the U.S. and China right now, and I’d rather play coy in the early stages of a conversation like this.
The driver thinks for a little bit, then then says, “Singapore. Yes, Singapore. You are Singaporean.” I had never heard this before. Drivers guessing a western country – yes; most often I get German or English. But this time, Singapore. Singapore? Really? I asked, “Why do you think Singapore?” He answered, “Well, your Chinese is very good. You speak very fluently. In Singapore, you grow up speaking Chinese in your homes. So, I think you must be Singaporean.” I found this exchange so fascinating. This individual had seen me, sized me up as he loaded my luggage into his car, taken me in visually. I do not look Singaporean – 97% of Singaporeans are ethnically Chinese, Malay, or Indian. But this individual’s mind went to language – if you speak Chinese this well, you must be from some place that speaks Chinese in the home. (I also have to admit that I do get some joy out of impressing people with my Chinese. After 35 years of studying the language, my heart still flutters a bit when someone says, “Your Chinese is very good…”)
Informal exploring is also important. My China mentor, Thomas Gold, once wrote a brilliant article on small-scale private business in China in the 1980s. The article was called, “Guerilla Interviewing Among the Getihu.” I remember reading this article in my early graduate school years, and having such a deep, formative impression of the importance of ethnographic interviewing. I remember asking Tom about this process. He humbly described his approach to his concept: “You just go in, make conversation, start talking about small things. Just put them at ease. Then you can start asking them the questions you are really interested in.” Guerilla interviewing, ethnographic research, informal exploration.
Informal exploration can come in different modes. When I arrived at my hotel, the Kempinski, I put on my running clothes and went off to find my old haunts. As I ran around the city, I made my way to the first road I lived on, then to the Shanghai Center, where I first learned cold calling for interviews at Chinese factories.
Here again, one of the core aspects of the On Global Leadership data collection process is going deep inside the society we are studying. We are not satisfied just collecting macroeconomic data and running regressions on those data. It is also important to walk the streets at night or spend time walking the grounds of the open economic zones, as we did in Zhengzhou and Zhenjiang on this trip. Sometimes it is about taking time away from intense days filled with interviews, choosing to spend your time at well known historic spaces like the Henan Museum, one of the famous ancient history museums in China, as Chris and I did during one of our afternoons in Zhengzhou.
Sometimes it means long lunches with an interviewee or team of interviewees. On this last one, this is often a big cultural mistake many American businesspeople make: With their fast-moving, cut-to-the-chase, no-time-for-long-lunches style, Americans often miss how important building relationships (guanxi) and sharing meals are to Chinese culture. Chris and I had a few long lunches on this research trip, spending a whole morning in interviews or touring an “Open Economic Zone,” then ending up in a multi-course, lazy-Susan lunch table.
More than anything, our team believes that data must be accompanied with deep cultural and social knowledge and on-the-ground experience. Anybody can pay for a dataset or hire a research assistant to scrape data. However, we fundamentally believe that the data and statistical analysis must be joined with in-depth historical research, insightful interviews, and thought-provoking analysis and case study.
In our work, we believe in a multi-method approach that looks rigorously at data from a unique dataset but also spends time with the individuals these data points represent. In my next post, I will take readers through the ways in which our on-the-ground research is pushing our theory and analysis of why China’s economy is so strong.
Doug Guthrie has been a China scholar since the late 1980s, when he began studying Chinese language, literature, and history at the University of Chicago. After graduate work at the University of California, Berkeley, he was a Professor of Management and Sociology at New York University for several years (1997-2010) and served as Dean of the School of Business and Vice President for University China Operations at the George Washington University (2010-14). From 2015-2019, he was a Senior Director at Apple and was based in China. Currently, he is Professor of Global Leadership at the Thunderbird School of Global Management, where he is also Executive Director of China Initiatives.
