AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide analyses about leadership in the global economy. In this post, we touch on the issues of trauma, vulnerability, and mental health, with insights from our newest contributor and partner Dr. Mark Goulston, who is a co-founder of OGL’s Deeper Coaching Institute, which seeks to unlock the hidden potential within people who feel blocked in advancing their lives and careers, giving them the tools to break free. This post was inspired by a wonderful book,Becoming Coachable: Unleashing the Power of Executive Coaching to Transform Your Leadership and Life,by Scott Osman, Jacquelyn Lane and Marshall Goldsmith, that is being published on September 19, 2023.

Let's take a moment to examine three concepts that often swirl around the world of self-improvement and professional development: coachability, teachability, and trainability.
While they are often used interchangeably, each of these terms shines a unique spotlight on our capacity to grow, learn and adapt. They each represent distinct facets of our personal development journey, but what is the connecting thread? Your personal willingness and commitment take that leap into action.
When we say someone is coachable, we're referring to their openness to receive feedback, their readiness and willingness to learn, and even their eagerness to alter their behavior.
Teachability, on the other hand, focuses on their willingness, eagerness, and ability to take on new knowledge and concepts—being open to igniting the spark of intellectual curiosity within them.
Finally, being trainable centers on their willingness, eagerness, and capacity to gain and utilize new skills in a pragmatic, real-world context.
Regarding willingness and eagerness, one truth is universal: People pay attention to what matters most to them.
Sounds pretty straightforward, right? But when viewed through the lens of coachability, teachability, and trainability, it takes on a deeper significance. If someone isn't fully engaged with what they're learning, their motivation to stick to the process—be it coaching, teaching, or training—will likely falter.
There is an exception to this rule. When there's a tangible financial incentive—such as career progression or an increase in income—people tend to prioritize and engage with coaching, learning, and training experiences. They may not spark passion, but they are crucial to securing a higher status and making more money.
This leaves us with a pressing question: How do we stoke a fire of commitment toward the areas we're being coached, taught, or trained in? By recognizing the value we derive from these experiences and harnessing this understanding to fuel our motivation.
Coaching isn't merely about instilling a specific set of skills or knowledge—it's about guiding individuals to tap into their full potential in areas they truly care about. Coaching can illuminate deeper self-awareness, enhance decision-making, and inspire a sense of purpose—all transformative outcomes.
Teaching, meanwhile, satisfies our intellectual curiosity. There's a genuine joy in discovering something new, in teasing apart the unknown, and that can be immeasurably rewarding. Some may question the value of knowledge for knowledge's sake, but for those with an intellectually curious mind, it offers deep fulfillment.
Training equips us with specific skills to perform better in our roles. It could lead to a promotion, a pay rise, or even just the pleasure of mastering a new skill. Training transforms us from beginners into capable performers, empowering us to make valuable contributions in our fields.
Being coachable, teachable, and trainable isn't just about inherent abilities; they are mental attitudes that we can foster and grow. It's all about a shift in perspective—seeing these processes not as tiresome obligations but as golden opportunities for personal growth and transformation. By understanding the connection between these processes and their potential benefits, we can nurture a deeper commitment to our own personal and professional development. This commitment is the cornerstone of ongoing learning, growth, and achievement.
