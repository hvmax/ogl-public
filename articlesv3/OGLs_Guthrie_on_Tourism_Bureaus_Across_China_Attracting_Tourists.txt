26 January 2024|China, Chinese Culture, Culture
AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy and, in particular, life in China. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. In this post, our Doug Guthrie follows our work on the strength of China’s economic development and the way in which Chinese local governments behave like managers in industrial firms (here). In this session, Guthrie participates on a three-personal panel interviewed by Kun Liu of CGTN’s World Today.
Listen to theshow.
As more and more Chinese people return to their pre-pandemic leisure habits, local cultural and tourism bureaus in various parts of China are exploring new and creative ways to attract tourists. Some bureau bosses have made themselves stars with costume dances, impromptu singing, and historical reenactments. Others have resorted to the influential celebrities, asking for their help to introduce culture and tourism sites.
What does such competition tell us about today's China? Apart from tourism, what other opportunities are presenting themselves for cities and provinces in China that are transforming from a reliance on heavy industry to high-quality development? Host Liu Kun is joined by Dr. Zhou Mi, Senior Research Fellow with Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation; Professor Doug Guthrie, Director of China Initiatives at Thunderbird School of Global Management; and Mike Bastin, China observer and senior lecturer at the University of Southampton.
