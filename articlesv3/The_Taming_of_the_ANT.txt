### The Taming of the ANT

22 November 2020|China, China politics, US-China Relations
AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy and, in particular, life in China. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. We have sought to advance a conversation about the U.S.-China relationship, and a deep understanding of local economic development in China. We have written a series about the strategic strength oflocal economic development in China’s 2nd and 3rd tier citiesandentrepreneurship in China todayas well as a series aboutChina’s Belt and Road Initiative. More recently, we have written aboutChina’s big tech economyand the companies that are changing Chinese society and the world. This post adds to that conversation. – The Editorial Team

Many large technology companies seem to believe they are saviors, transforming the world economically and socially, democratizing access to commerce, “enriching people’s lives,” as one of the world’s largest technology companies often says. There is a sense that, in their pursuit of solutions to lead the world into a new economic age, critics are neither qualified nor capable to challenge them, because these companies are the future, and they are special. One of the consequences of this disposition is that regulation and supervision of these companies has been a challenge. This is true in both in the U.S. and China, where regulation is a double-edged sword. On one hand, inasmuch as these behemoths reflect the competitiveness and innovation of a country, regulation could restrict a nation’s economic vitality and growth. On the other hand, the dominance of these giants has brought some negative effects to the economy and, of greater concern, the social fabric. To regulate or not, that is the question.
After long hesitation with regard to Chinese big tech, the Chinese regulatory authorities finally pulled out their sword and swung it at the Ant Group (ANT), an Alibaba company that was on track to become the largest IPO in history. (Over a decade before, Alibaba itself had established the record, so the ANT IPO would make Jack Ma 2-for-2.)
On the evening of November 3, 2020, just 36 hours ahead of a scheduled debut in Shanghai and Hong Kong, the Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE) surprised the market by announcing that it would suspend ANT’s listing in its STAR Market. About an hour later, ANT announced its Hong Kong IPO was to be shelved as well. The suspension of ANT’s listing plan sent a strong signal that the Chinese Government would have a say in what was happening in China’s financial markets.
Given this startling development, we aspire to introduce our readership in a detailed and nuanced way to ANT, so they can understand this important organization, ANT retains its status as the world’s largest Unicorn. (Unicorns are privately held companies worth more than one billion USD, and ANT is the most valuable Unicorn in the world by far.)
First, however, it is important to give a high-level discussion of what we think has happened here. As we have discussed previously, it is important to remember that there is a close alliance between the Central Government, local governments, and the private sector – they all work together in the economic development of Chinese society. This is not a free market, but it is a collective market. There is a close alliance between President Xi Jinping’s administration and big tech, as the government is relying on companies likeAlibaba and Tencent to continue China’s transition to the next phase of economic growth, the building of a consumption-based economy. So, what is really going on here? From our analysis, there are three possibilities (and all of these can be true at the same time):
1. Jack Ma is being punished for speaking out too dismissively against the banking sector, and the government is reminding him that they are in a partnership together and the adversarial rhetoric needs to be dialed back.
2. There is also a feeling that Alibaba and Jack Ma are becoming too big, and this delay in the ANT IPO was a reminder that the Chinese Government is still in control. In 2014, the Alibaba IPO was the largest in history to date. Six years later, Jack Ma was set to oversee another record-setting IPO. It may be the case that the Chinese Government felt a need to remind Mr. Ma (and his peers) that the Chinese Government is still in control of the powerful global corporations that are emerging in China.
3. There may also be basic regulatory issues in play here. Technology companies have the advantages of less regulation (and as one consequence, higher trading multiples), and, while the ANT Group has been arguing that they are a technology company and therefore should not be subject to the same regulations of the commercial banking industry (e.g., capital reserve requirements and the like), it may just be that the government is not buying it. It is clear that ANT is a FinTech company and perhaps it should be subject to the same type of regulatory oversight that the commercial banking industry is subject to.
All three of these dynamics are likely in play, and the Chinese Government decided to slow things down and invite Mr. Ma and his team in for tea and a chat. Now, onto the details of The Taming of the ANT…
The Most Expensive Speech in the History of the World
ANT is the most important arm of the Alibaba Empire. This Fintech behemoth is actually controlled by Jack Ma, founder of China’s e-commerce platform Alibaba. On November 5, ANT was ready to break the world record for the largest IPO in history with a $37 billion offering and with an estimated valuation close to $300 billion, a valuation nearly equal to the market value of Bank of America and Goldman Sachs combined.
The fuse of the to the explosion was a speech given by Jack Ma at the opening ceremony of the Second Shanghai Bund Financial Summit on October 24, 2020, a 21-minute speech that cost Mr. Ma an estimated $3Billion. The 3-day summit is the highest-level financial conference in China. Although claiming to be unofficial, the conference has attracted much attention over the last two years due to the participation of some heavyweight officials such as Wang Qishan (王岐山),Vice President of the People's Republic of China; Zhou Xiaochuan (周小川), former Governor of the People’s Bank of China;Yi Gang (易纲)Governor of the People’s Bank of China; Jin Liqun (金立群),President of Asian Development Bank as well as business tycoons like Jack Ma, co-founder and former Chairman of the Alibaba Group. Ma, who claims to be a retired financial layman, spent his allotted time attacking China’s current financial regulatory system in front of these officials. Here are the main points Jack Ma touched upon in his 21-minute speech.
First: “Basel [referring to the Basel Accords] is like a club for the elderly. What the Basel Accords want to solve is the problems facing an aging financial system that has been in operation for decades… While big banks are more like big rivers and the aorta of blood, we need lakes, ponds, streams and creeks… Today our country is at a risk of a diminishing financial system, not the risk of the financial system.”
Second: “It is difficult to regulate nowadays. Innovation comes from the market, from the grassroots, from young people, and its challenge to regulation is increasing… We can’t manage an airport the same way we manage a railway station, neither can we manage our future the way we have managed in the past… Some of our directors (of the government), their supervision has turned out to be no risk for themselves, no risk for their own department, but they put the entire economy at risk, the risk of not developing.”
Third: “The essence of finance is credit. We must walk away from a pawnshop mentality and rely on a strong credit system. Today, our banks continue to be pawnshops: mortgages and guarantees reveal a pawnshop mentality… We must use today’s technical capabilities to replace pawnshop thinking, replace it with a credit system based on big data…The future financial system will go from helping 20% of people to helping 80% of young people and small businesses thrive…”
Ma noted that the reason he spoke so extensively on this topic (he went six minutes over his allotted time) is that, “although the world has left us with many development opportunities, there are only one or two key opportunities, and now is that most critical moment…” What would become clear after the event is that China’s regulatory authorities also believe that they are in a “critical moment,”and fintech giants would not be allowed to grow unregulated. On October 31, Vice premier Liu He (刘鹤) when chairing the Financial Stability and Development Committee under the State Council,emphasized that “we should not only encourage innovation and promote entrepreneurship, but also strengthen supervision, incorporate all types of financial activities into supervision in accordance with the law, and effectively prevent risks. Regulatory authorities must treat similar businesses and entities equally.”Statements such as these and the subsequent suspension of signifies the sea change of Fintech regulation in China.
On November 2, China’s top financial regulatory authorities, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC), the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC), the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), and the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, jointly summoned ANT’s ultimate controller Jack Ma, ANT executive chairman Eric Jing and ANT CEO Simon Hu for a regulatory talk. ANT later responded to the meeting in 16 Chinese characters:“Innovate steadily, embrace regulation, serve the real economy, pursue openness and win-win.” Chinese social media often taunts the importance of news this way – “the fewer the characters, the bigger the matter,” and this saying obviously applies to ANT’s response. The short response of ANT indicated that the company's prospects were getting tough;greater regulation and more oversight were coming.
Sure enough, on the evening of November 2, CBIRC and PBC jointly published the draft of a new regulation, “the Interim Measures on Internet Micro Lending Loans (Consultation Paper)”. ANT had warned in its prospectus, “We and our partners are subject to a broad range of laws and regulations, and future laws and regulations may impose additional requirements and other obligations that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of our operations" is coming real. The new regulation means that ANT's regulatory environment has undergone tremendous changes, and the compliance of its business to the Consultation Paper will encounter huge problems. Because of such “major issue,” “ANT’s IPO was put on hold in order to protect the interests of consumers and investors,” said SSE in a statement.
The ANT Model and the New Regulation
What is ANT?– Recently, a number of scholars and financial analysts have written about ANT. Originally founded as a business unit of e-commerce giant Alibaba, ANT is the most comprehensive and complex Fintech platform in the world.ANT essentially carries out a variety of non-financial, financial, quasi-financial and financial infrastructure businesses across borders, and, as a result,ANT has become the most highly mixed financial business organization in the world. ANT’s Alipay is such a super mobile APP that integrates the function of Apple Pay, PayPal, Venmo, Visa, JP Morgan and iShares in one.
From ANT’s 2019 revenue, we can see CreditTech which provides credit and loans to consumers and SMBs cf(small and micro business) has surpassed Digital payment and merchant service as ANT’s biggest revenue generator. Two major products of CreditTech is Huabei (花呗) and Jiebei (借呗). Huabei serves as a virtual credit card to Alipay users, allowing 40 days interest-free period for a consumption quota ranging from ￥500 to ￥50,000. Jiebei provides loan typically ranging from 1,000 to 300,000 yuan for Alipay users, the amount is affected by the credit scores calculated by ANT. Approximately 98% of the consumer and SMB credit balances enabled through CreditTech as of June 30, 2020 were underwritten by ANT’s partner financial institutions or securitized through ABS. ANT receives technology service fees as a percentage of the interest income.
New regulations and the impact on ANT’s CreditTech business– From constant name changes to its prospectus, ANT wants to hide their financial identity and be treated as a technology company, in order to avoid the strict regulation of financial companies.
Translation: “The Ant Group… is not a financial institution…[it is] a…technology company,” from the Application Proof of ANT.
Article 2 of the new regulation stipulates the online micro-landings as the businesses that “using big data, cloud computing, mobile network and other technical means as tools, analyzing and evaluating credit risks of borrowers and determining loan methods and amount through internet platforms’ data of client management, online consumptions, online transactions, as well as through other legally acquired data information, completing loan applications, risk reviews, loan approvals, loan issuance, and loan recovery processes online.” The definition hits the point, the underlying logic of ANT's CreditTech business is micro-loan, ANT jointly lends with other banks.
If the Consultation Paper is to be strictly implemented, the impact on ANT’s CreditTech business will be enormous. Among the new regulatory requirements, loan leverage ratio and lender’s contribution to a joint loan are the biggest challenge for ANT. Article 12 stipulates that funds received through borrowing or ABS shall not exceed 5 times the lender’s net assets. In a single joint loan, the proportion of fund contribution of an Internet  company shall not be less than 30%. Based on the new requirement, ANT’s ￥2.15 trillion CreditTech loan balance as at the end of June 2020 requires a minimum registered capital of ￥107.5 billion, while total net assets of the two small loan companies of ANT only reaches ￥35.8 billion.
Have We Wronged ANT?
No matter how ANT is packaged, the core of its business is finance. We’d rather to say that the IPO of ANT has greatly speeded up the regulation process on Fintech companies and Jack Ma's speech made the regulators more determined, rather than saying the new regulation is mainly targeting at ANT.
One lesson of the 2008 global financial crisis is that the losses caused by “innovative“ financial products are not borne by a few people who enjoy the benefits but by the whole society, the taxpayers. In recent years, the internet finance chaos represented by P2P has interfered with the Chinese economy. The government, regulatory agencies, financial consumers and even ordinary people have all paid a price.
The big trend of China’s financial regulation is to penetrate the external technical form and determine the essence of various "new businesses" and "new products". In order to create a fair competition environment, it is critical to bring all financial activities into same supervision with the same regulatory rules. Compared to financial industry which has received strict regulation and supervision, the rise of ANT and other Fintech companies have benefited from regulatory arbitrage and relatively loose regulatory standards. The future of ANT is to some extent in the hands of regulators. Jack Ma’s speech at the Bund Summit seems to give people the impression that he was publicly lobbying for Fintech companies like ANT. It now appears that his speech was counterproductive.
Jack Ma’s so-called big data social credit system is built on data from user scenario provided by the Alibaba eco-system. However, their credit evaluation algorithm is a black box.Its validity and reliability have not been tested through complete economic cycle, especially in the pressure of an economic downturn. Most of ANT's 500 million consumer credit users are long-tail customers, most of them fail to get a credit cards and most don’t know the difference between interest and a service fee. If risk in this population occurs, it will have greater adverse social consequences than will be weathered by wealthier consumer banks. In addition, the collection and use of big data is also subject to compliance issues such as customer privacy protection. Are these reasons why Jack Ma did not mention a word on data risk in his controversial speech?
From a public perspective, despite mixed comments on the government’s sudden suspension of ANT’s IPO, Internet giants represented by Alibaba and Tencent are facing greater pressure and harsher scrutiny as well. In this winner-take-all business climate, these Internet companies have reached a de facto monopoly in their particular fields, and their users are facing increasing arrogance and deteriorating user experience. Although ANT has enabled many people who don’t meet bank loan requirements to find the money they need, the borrowers will pay a total of about 15% interest and service fees compared to about 6% of normal bank loan interest. In Huabei's latest advertisement, the 37-year-old construction team leader has a tight family budget and needs to “calculate carefully” on spending, but he still borrows money through Huabei to give his daughter a decent birthday celebration. The advertisement suggests that without this, he would not be a good father. What Huabei has not told this family or many other families is that the money used for the birthday needs to be repaid at 15% interest – starting to sound like the rates of credit card companies in the United States.
A Revisit of ANT
The stock market’s valuation of technology companies and financial companies differs greatly. Here we pick China Merchants Bank (CBM) and Lufax Holding Ltd. (Lufax) as benchmarks to understand the valuation of ANT. CBM is the best-performing retail bank and the 6th largest bank in China, currently listed in SSE(600036), total market value of China Merchants Bank is ￥1.12 trillion or USD 169.7 billion. CBM overlaps with ANT’s Jiebei and SMB credit business. Lufax (LU) is a rival Fintech platform backed by Ping An Insurance Group, debuted on the New York Stock Exchange on 31 October,2020, current market value of Lufax is around USD 36 billion. The business of Lufax has transitioned from peer-to-peer (P2P) to retail borrowing and wealth management, targeting personal lending among small business owners as well as salaried employees in China.
Looking at data from the three companies, we can see ANT has the highest CAGR and CMB, the highest profit margin, and total profit. The average loan amount per ticket for CMB and Lufax are much bigger than ANT. Unlike ANT, CMB and Lufax sometimes require collateral, especially for bigger ticket loans and a longer average contractual tenor. Perhaps not surprisingly, ANT has the highest delinquency rate because of its zero collateral policy and its customer base. ANT’s valuation is also much higher than the other two companies.
Taking into account new regulatory measures and the valuation of financial companies, it is generally estimated that ANT’s valuation will be reduced by at least 30%. As for the timing of an IPO restart, at least H1 of 2021 is not likely to happen. If more regulatory measures related to ANT's other businesses are introduced, it will further affect ANT’s valuation and further delay IPO time. In the future, we expect that the suspension of ANT’s IPO will not only impact ANT itself, but also other companies in Alibaba’s ecology as well.
The Future of ANT
ANT is a powerful fintech company, a symbol of the digital economy in China and a source of pride there. However, good luck may not always be with ANT. To most people in China, ANT broke its wings in the autumn of 2020; like Icarus, the company flew too close to the sun. Or it may be the case that all of this was a little more intentional. Perhaps we have all been cheated by Jack Ma because his speech could be a sacrifice fly. If the listing price and expectations for ANT were too high because of the new regulations that were coming, ANT’s IPO suspension has, in fact, given ANT and CSRC an opportunity to pull themselves back into the regulatory world that is emerging in China surrounding banking and fintech.
A seemingly suicidal speech may actually provide all parties a decent way out: regulatory authorities can naturally introduce new regulatory measures; ANT can avoid a series of risks like lawsuits brought by the new regulations; and Jack Ma keeps his chivalrous halo for courageously criticizing the banking industry, which is mostly state-owned and has allowed Ma to speak for the interests of shareholders and his friends, regardless of his personal gains and losses. Even without an IPO, ANT’s competitiveness is still much stronger than most traditional financial companies, not to mention foreign-invested financial institutions known in China as pandas. And the IPO will eventually come. As long as Ma and ANT know where the boundary is and as long as they realize they are in partnership with the Chinese Government, they will be fine.
For other countries around the world, the ANT incident provides a vivid case of regulating technology giants. While one part of this narrative looks like the Chinese Government disciplining and reigning in a tech tycoon, there is also a serious regulatory story. This is also about the Chinese Government applying the same regulatory standards to the fast-evolving fintech sector as it does to commercial banking. If we are to avoid another crisis like we experienced in 2008, perhaps we should take seriously the Chinese regulatory example.
