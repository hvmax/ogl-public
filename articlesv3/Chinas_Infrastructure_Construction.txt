### China’s Infrastructure Construction

8 June 2021|China, Economic Development, Infrastructure
AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy and, in particular, life in China. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. We have sought to advance a conversation about theU.S.-China relationship, and a deep understanding of local economic development in China. We have written a series about the strategic strengthentrepreneurship in China todayas well as a series aboutChina’s Belt and Road Initiative, andChina’s big tech economyand the companies that are changing Chinese society and the world. We have also written a series about innovative local governance and economic development in China’s provinces and cities (for examplehere,here, andhere). This post seeks to extend the conversation around economic development in China today, with an emphasis on China’s approach to infrastructure development. – The Editorial Team

Home to the world’s longest cross-sea bridge, the largest hydroelectric power station, the fastest commercial railway (among other superlatives in the area of infrastructure), China is sometimes described as an “infrastructure maniac.”
Concerned over the fact that China is outpacing the U.S. on infrastructure, President Biden warned that China is going to "eat our lunch" if the U.S. does not get moving on infrastructure. His concerns may have been heightened after seeing China’s infrastructure scorecard at the end of 2020 (1):
A national grid with an installed electricity generation capacity of 220,058 million kilowatts161,000 kilometers of highway38,000 kilometers of high-speed rail9.31 million base transceiver stations51.69 million kilometers of fiber-optic cable
• A national grid with an installed electricity generation capacity of 220,058 million kilowatts
• 161,000 kilometers of highway
• 38,000 kilometers of high-speed rail
• 9.31 million base transceiver stations
• 51.69 million kilometers of fiber-optic cable
Bear in mind, China has built all of this in the last four decades. No country in the world can compete with this record of infrastructure development. So, how should we view China’s infrastructure development? And, as the world’s (current) largest economy, how should the U.S. respond?
The “Old Infrastructure”
Investment is one of the three engines of China’s economic development (the other two are exports and consumption). Investment is the “ballast stone” of the Chinese economy. Increasing infrastructure investment is a “cardio booster,” allowing the Chinese government to respond to negative external pressure on the economy.
After the Asian Financial Crisis in 1998, the Chinese government implemented a proactive, investment-oriented fiscal policy and implemented a round of traditional infrastructure (the “Old Infrastructure”) construction such as railways, bridges, and highways to stimulate the economy. These measures have minimized the adverse impact of the crisis on China and have laid a solid foundation to attract foreign investment after China joined the WTO in 2001.
Starting in 2009, to cope with the negative impact of the 2008 global financial crisis, China promoted another round of large-scale infrastructure construction represented by the Beijing-Shanghai high-speed rail. As of the end of 2020, 99% of the cities in mainland China with a population of over 200,000 have been covered by railway operations and 98.6% by highways; High-speed rail operations have covered 95% of cities with a population over 1 million (2).
The “New Infrastructure”
When the COVID-19 pandemic swept across the world in 2020, in China, nationwide construction of traditional infrastructure like transportation and electricity had basically been completed. It seemed obvious to many observers that the “Old Infrastructure” would not able to assume the task of China’s economic growth engine for a third time. Therefore, the central government proposed to accelerate the construction of China’s “New Infrastructure,” which included 5G networks and data centers. The investment and construction of these “New Infrastructure” areas aim to drive the development of the digital economy, long-term technological progress, and industrial innovation. At present, the role of the “Old Infrastructure” construction is to stabilize the economic and maintain social order. Most of its projects are closely related to the lives of ordinary people and employ a large number of lower-level laborers who are more affected by the pandemic. From the perspective of investment scale, in the short term, the “New Infrastructure” cannot replace traditional infrastructure (3). How to balance the “New Infrastructure” and the “Old Infrastructure” is a challenge for governments in China at all levels.
Funding of Infrastructure Projects
Regardless the “New infrastructure” or the “Old Infrastructure,” Chinese leaders would like to avoid another debt crisis and avoid repeating the mistakes of losing the opportunity to adjust China’s economic structure. The key is to establish a new investment and financing system for infrastructure projects. Here we take the Beijing-Shanghai high-speed rail project as a successful case to illustrate.
Beijing-Shanghai High Speed Railway Co., Ltd. (“JHGT”) was founded in Beijing on December 27, 2007. It is the only company in the railway industry that introduces cash social investors that put the new model of investment and financing for railway construction into practice. The construction of Beijing-Shanghai high-speed railway officially started on April 18, 2008, and was opened to traffic on June 30, 2011. The rail line has a total length of 1,318 kilometers, 24 stations and is able to operate at a speed of 350 kilometers per hour. JHGT is the entity that invests, constructs and operates the Beijing-Shanghai high-speed railway and stations along the line. As of January 16, 2020, when JHGT was listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange, the Beijing-Shanghai high-speed railway had sent 1.1 billion passengers in total.
According to public media, the total investment approved in the Beijing-Shanghai high-speed rail feasibility report is ￥220.9 billion, its final total investment amount has not been reported. We can learn from JHGT's 2019 annual report that the capital investment of the company’s shareholders before the IPO was ￥142.92 billion, accounting for 64.7% of the project's total investment. Due to its high capital ratio, the pressure on debt service has been significantly reduced. As of the end of 2019, JHGT’s asset-liability ratio was 14.25%, much lower than that of the company’s actual controller, China Railway Group’s 66.08% in the same period.
At present, China’s railway construction funds mainly come from four sources:
Special fund for railway construction;Railway enterprise bonds;National debt and budgetary funds from the central government;Local governments participate in railway construction by direct investment or undertaking land acquisition and demolition costs;Social investment
• Special fund for railway construction;
• Railway enterprise bonds;
• National debt and budgetary funds from the central government;
• Local governments participate in railway construction by direct investment or undertaking land acquisition and demolition costs;
• Social investment
Local and social capital invested in the Beijing-Shanghai high-speed rail project has obtained considerable benefits, the shareholder's ￥1 equity investment 10 years ago now worth ￥5.78 (4). A logical direction of China's railway construction investment is to divide the market into market-oriented projects and public welfare projects. Market-oriented projects are mainly in the eastern developed regions. As railway construction brings real benefits like land appreciation to local governments, if they do not increase their capital contribution, it will be difficult for local governments to obtain new high-speed railway and inter-city railway projects. Railway construction in underdeveloped areas such as the west provinces should be treated as public welfare projects and continues to rely on the funding from the National Railway Group and the central government.
In November 2019, in order to prevent the debt risk caused by investment in fixed assets, the State Council of China issued new regulations on fixed asset investment capital. Projects that do not meet the requirements will not receive bank loans or obtain government approval. The key requirements specified include:
The capital for investment in business projects must be non-debt funds.The minimum capital ratio for infrastructure projects is 20%, and can be lowered maximum another 5% for specific roads, railways, urban construction, ecological and environmental protection after approval.Equity instrument can be recognized as project investment capital, but shall not exceed 50% of the total capital.
• The capital for investment in business projects must be non-debt funds.
• The minimum capital ratio for infrastructure projects is 20%, and can be lowered maximum another 5% for specific roads, railways, urban construction, ecological and environmental protection after approval.
• Equity instrument can be recognized as project investment capital, but shall not exceed 50% of the total capital.
What Should the U.S. Do?
First of all, it should not be forgotten that the U.S. was also an “infrastructure maniac” once upon a time, and even today the traditional infrastructure level of America still exceeds that of China. Sixty-five years ago, when bicycles were luxury goods in China, Americans began to build the Interstate Highway System. China’s infrastructure construction has borrowed and learned from the experience of the U.S. and is like a replica of the Interstate Highway System. Having that said, it is an indisputable fact that the transportation infrastructure in America is aging.
Second, the U.S. has fallen behind in the “New Infrastructure.” In 2019 and 2020, according to “The Global Competitiveness Report” published by World Economic Forum, ICT (Information and Communications Technology) related infrastructure scores of the U.S. lag significantly behind those of China. It appears that America now needs to regain the courage and wisdom for continuing to build and develop the once-world-leading Interstate Highway System.
Third, it is surprising that American politicians today still feel a need to paint China as a pirate or rogue developing nation in order to mobilize people and promote their projects. By contrast, in China, one rarely hears Chinese officials mentioning America when they build infrastructure. Chinese motivation for infrastructure development is based on China’s domestic economic and political needs. The population of China is four times that of the United States. If China builds high-speed rail, does the U.S. have to build high-speed rail as well? Americans should think clearly about what is best for their own country in terms of infrastructure and a vision for the future. There are 19,600 airports in the U.S. and only 241 in China. However, instead of building more airports, the Chinese government has chosen high-speed rail.
In sum, these two powerful economies have chosen different paths toward infrastructure development in recent decades. There is little doubt that the U.S. needs to invest more in its infrastructure, but the world’s #1 economy does have a deep history of building this way, going back as far as the early 20th Century. Today, however, China is leading the world in the building of roads, railway lines, and a digital infrastructure that is integrating the economies within and beyond its borders.
