### CHINA CONSUMPTION SERIES 3: REAL ESTATE AND HOUSEHOLD CONSUMPTION

3 September 2025|China's Transforming Economy
AtOn Global Leadership, we have developed a deep analysis of the Chinese economy and the Chinese economic transformation over the last 45 years. We have written about China’s innovative approach to building the most dynamic manufacturing supply chain in the world and China’s approach to building the world’s most dynamic capitalist economy. We have advanced this through our work on China’ssecond- andthird-tier city development of innovative,entrepreneurial citiesandlocal industrial clusters. We have also used the field of NewEconomy Sociology(with leaders likeNeil Fligstein,Walter Powell, andHarrison White) and theNew Structural Economics(Justin Lin,林毅夫). In our OGL approach to research, we focus in on very specific cities, local political economies, and topics. In this post, we follow up on a meeting with one of the world’s leading economists, Professor Justin Lin. In that meeting Professor Lin, asked OGL to lay out our analysis of what was happening in China’s Consumption Economy development. This article is the third in a series of OGL analyses on this topic. To dive into this topic, we look deeply into specific issues of the consumption economy, in this case the use of real estate in household consumption.

As with all developed economies, consumption has become a central driver of China’s economy. However, insufficient effective domestic demand continues to pose a significant constraint. What supply- and demand-side factors contribute to this phenomenon? In our previous articles on consumption, we examined living standards in China through the lens of air conditioning (AC) ownership (read part 1hereand part 2here). This article continues to explore the important issue of consumption in China, though here we examine the important role of real estate in Chinese household consumption.
The Important Role of Real Estate
The impact of real estate on household consumption in China has long been a focal point of economic discussion, frequently cited as a major reason behind weak consumer spending. After 2014, surging housing prices constrained consumption as households redirected financial resources toward property purchases. Since 2021, declining property values amid a cooling market have eroded consumer confidence. However, attributing consumption trends exclusively to real estate oversimplifies macroeconomic mechanisms and neglects the multifaceted nature of household consumption in China. Using both data and real-life observations, this article aims to move beyond such reductive narrative and provide a more nuanced understanding of how housing purchases have influenced consumption patterns over the past decade.
According to the 2019 Survey on the Balance Sheet of China’s Urban Households (3) conducted by the People’s Bank of China, the average urban household held total assets of ¥3.179 million ($461,000), with nearly 70% tied up in housing assets, and a homeownership rate as high as 96.0%. In many ways, real estate’s role in Chinese households’ wealth mirrors that of the stock market in American households’ asset portfolios. As a result, real estate fluctuations understandably exert a substantial influence on consumption – a connection grounded in both experience and economic logic.
Between 2014 and 2021, the real estate market expanded rapidly, steadily rising prices led to a split in consumer behavior: prospective buyers saw their discretionary spending shrink under the weight of high down payments and mortgages, while existing homeowners enjoyed a pronounced wealth effect, fueling spending on luxury items and high-end experiences. This dynamic shifted after 2021 as prices began to fall. Households that had bought at peak prices faced shrinking assets and turned more conservative in their spending. Weakening price expectations, paired with interest rate cuts meant to stimulate the economy, strengthened incentives to save and prepay mortgages. Even those who purchased within budget grew cautious amid falling prices. Overall, the past decade has left the public deeply aware of the anxiety felt by non-owners during the boom and the lost of those who bought at the peak.
Based on rough estimates, approximately 130 million new homes and 50 million existing homes were sold between 2014 and 2023, totaling around 180 million units. Over the same period, there were roughly 340 million urban households. This means cumulative transactions accounted for about 53% of the urban household count. However, due to repeated transactions – such as resales of second-hand homes or multiple purchases by wealthy families – the number of transactions far exceeded the number of participating households. Thus, despite high transaction volumes, the proportion of urban households actually involved in the property market remains well below 50%. This context is essential for understanding the weak correlation between macro-level consumption data and real estate market fluctuations.
From 2014 to 2023, the ratio of actual final consumption expenditure to total household disposable income in China showed a consistent upward trend, suggesting no strong link to housing price. This resilience can be explained by three main factors:
1.Sustained Income Growth and an Expanding Middle Class: Steady increases in disposable income and the growth of the middle class have strengthened overall consumption capacity, providing a solid foundation for continued spending growth.
2.Limited Direct Impact of Housing Costs: Although the real estate market is large, fewer than half of urban households directly engaged in property transactions. Moreover, housing-related expenses – such as down payments and mortgage repayments – account for less than 30% of total household consumption (4), indicating a limited direct crowding-out effect on other spending.
3.Weak Link Between Price Fluctuations and Core Consumption: Housing price changes in general have not affected on total essential consumption across income groups:
a)Low-income groups: Spending is focused on basic necessities, which are largely immune to housing market swings.
b)Middle-income groups (especially in Tier 1 and 2 cities): Service-oriented expenditures—such as those on education, healthcare, and tourism—has increasingly been seen as essential and tends to remain stable unless affected by major financial shocks.
c)High-income groups: Consumption is highly diversified, with housing costs making up only a small share of total expenses.
To summarize our arguments advanced here: China’s household consumption has remained stable and resilient, and sustained growth is expected to continue. For years, the real estate sector has often been viewed as a key factor influencing household consumption and is frequently cited as the major cause of insufficient consumption levels. While this perspective reflects legitimate public concerns, it may obscure the deeper structural and systemic constraints that fundamentally limit consumption growth.
We will continue to explore these underlying issues in detail in our ongoing “China Consumption Series.”

1. Over the past decade, the average price of new homes has fluctuated smoothly due to transaction mix, far from reflecting the actual market volatility. For example, in first- and second-tier cities, pre-owned home prices rose 2–3 times between 2014 and 2021, followed by a sharp 20–30% drop from the peak, better capturing the real market swings.
2. The National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) has not clearly defined how to classify housing provident fund loans (a) received by real estate developers from buyers. Based on analysis, the author determines that these loans are neither deposits and advance payments (b) nor personal mortgage loans (c). Because of the time delay between loan disbursement and developers’ actual receipt, a+b+c can serve as a rough estimate of residents’ annual spending on new commercial residential properties.

4. The data was derived by the author using the ratio of national new home transaction value to second-hand home transaction value for the following periods: 2014–2016: 3.5; 2017–2019: 3; 2020–2022: 2.3; and 2023: 1.5.
