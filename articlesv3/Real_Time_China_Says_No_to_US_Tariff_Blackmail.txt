### Real Time: China Says No to U.S. Tariff "Blackmail"

8 April 2025|China, Economic Development, Geopolitics, Trade, Trump administration, US-China Relations
On April 2, 2025, U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order to announce the imposition of "reciprocal tariffs". Trade partners of the U.S. were subjected to Trump tariffs ranging from 10% to 49%, with China facing a tariff rate of 34%. Before the opening of the U.S. stock market on April 4, 2025, China hit back with a flurry of countermeasures, including imposing a 34% tariff on imports of all U.S. products starting April 10. This OGL Real Time focuses on the reactions of Chinese netizens and the Chinese government to Trump tariffs.
By the OGL Team,
As the latest round of Trump tariffs takes effect, Chinese netizens are taking to the country’s vast digital landscape to voice their opinions—ranging from nationalist defiance to economic anxiety. While official state media has portrayed the move as yet another challenge to be met with resilience and innovation, online forums, comment sections, and social media platforms tell a more nuanced story.
Before turning to Chinese netizen reactions to the tariff spree, we must mention a few issues about the tariffs from OGL’s point of view. First, to be very clear, the Trump tariff formula is simply silly. The core issue of the Trump tariff calculation is that the numerator of the equation is the trade deficit the United States has with a given country. It is simplistic and, indeed, silly, to equate a trade deficit to a tariff. Now, the “economists” of the Administration might say, “we are not ‘equating’ trade deficits to tariffs, do you see this complex formula?’” But take our word for it, essentially, the driver of this equation is that Country X ships more to the US than the US ships to Country X. To be clear for our readers: a trade imbalance isNOTa tariff. Trade imbalances can come from tariffs; however, they are two separate things. To have such an equation behind a public display of “tariffs charged to the U.S.A.” is simply irresponsible.
Second, the Trump administration’s position is ridiculous in that it does not account for U.S. firms’ overseas manufacturing abroad. For example, this single largest exporter from China to the United States is Walmart. And we have reported and analyzed elsewhere that the reason Apple is among the most profitable and valuable companies in the world is because of its deep embeddedness in China’s manufacturing supply chain. So, yes, Walmart and Apple exports that come from China to the United States do contribute to the trade imbalance, but the value and profits, which support Americans’ retirement plans are fundamentally driven by the partnership between these firms and China’s manufacturing supply chain. For the OGL team, it is a little breathtaking how irresponsibly the president has been using and manipulating data in his announcements and social media posts about his new trade regime.
How do Chinese netizens view this round of Trump tariffs?
During the just concluded Tomb-Sweeping Day holiday (April 4-6), Trump tariffs became a hot topic on China’s social media. While the majority of voices expressed support for the government's countermeasures and anger toward the tariffs, a minority voiced concerns.
Below are comments reflecting these concerns and some replies. The interactions objectively represent the views of Chinese netizens on social media(1):
凌寒楊(from Jiangsu) :If retaliatory tariffs are imposed, the impact on China would still be greater than on the United States. The disparity in import volumes is significant, and China exports easily replaceable products while importing less substitutable goods.很内耗(from Tianjin):If there were truly substitutable products, the U.S. would have already restricted exports to China. Besides, kneeling and pleading is useless when others keep attacking you.千寻夏夜(from Guangdong):It's hard to find someone who's thinking straight around here. With all the cheering going on, not many people seem to realize just how big our losses will be.西西锦囊(from Zhejiang):Everyone knows the losses are going to be huge, and that's exactly why this tough, drastic move is so inspiring—losing an arm might let you survive, but letting them put you in a chokehold means certain death. Should we beg on our knees like dogs for mercy? Let's face it, the relationship has already been torn apart. America's goal is simple: they want to wipe you out.小褚有话说(from Shanghai):Exporters should not blame the government’s countermeasures, but rather direct their frustration at Trump, who provoked the trade war in the first place.十点看盘666(from Henan): Sounds like the authorities don't get it? With a 67% tariff (2) pushing us to the edge, what choice do we have but to fight back? Should we just roll over and pay up?

Given that the tariff war has already begun, there is no doubt China will suffer losses. However, given the rising tide of public sentiment, refraining from retaliating against Trump tariffs would mean political suicide for Beijing.
In addition to countermeasures, Chinese official media released the document "the Chinese government's position on opposing US abuse of tariffs" on April 5th(3). How does OGL comment on these moves?
In February and March 2025, the United States imposed 10% tariffs on Chinese goods, citing the fentanyl issue, and prompted countermeasures from China. But Beijing’s retaliation against these latest so-called retaliatory tariffs proved far more robust than many had anticipated. The strategy was multi-layered:
China unveiled countermeasures within 36 hours of Trump's tariff announcement, demonstrating Beijing's preparedness.The package--including imposing equivalent 34% tariffs on all U.S. imports, adding 16 American entities to export control lists, and restricting exports of seven categories of medium/heavy rare earths among other eight measures--constitutes significantly stronger retaliation than previous rounds.China is leading the counteroffensive against Trump tariffs, aiming to channel global discontent over U.S. levies into a collective force against American unilateral hegemony.As stated in its April 5 policy document, which describes China as "a civilization with ancient heritage," the move reflects Beijing's unique approach and hints at preparations for a long-term confrontation.Beijing is not relying on bilateral negotiations with Washington to reduce trade frictions. Instead, it focuses on strengthening domestic capabilities and creating new institutional frameworks. The strategy includes building alternative systems without U.S. participation if the United States continues to disengage from multilateral trade regimes.While the Trump 1.0 trade war spurred China's technological advancements, the Trump 2.0 trade war, at the juncture of China's economic transformation, will become a new impetus to boost China's domestic consumption market.

The countermeasures against Trump's tariffs have gained support from the majority of Chinese netizens. What are the reasons behind this?
In 2018, during Trump's first term, the Chinese public was caught off guard by the trade war, leading to significant calls for conciliatory measures. The Chinese government initially was willing to make big compromises during the negotiation in order to reach an agreement.
After years of the U.S.-driven trade war, many in China now believe that Washington's economic tactics infringe on China's developmental sovereignty. The nation's economic resilience is demonstrated by sustained high-volume trade with the United States and technological breakthrough exemplified by Huawei and DeepSeek, reinforcing public confidence in Beijing's systemic fortitude.
What's more, Trump's capricious discarding of hard-won agreements has solidified public perception of his unreliability as a trading partner. As the trade war enters its eighth year, there is an "enough is enough" sentiment among Chinese netizens.
Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Lin Jian said on the Regular Press Conference on March 4, 2025: “If the U.S. has other agenda in mind and if war is what the U.S. wants, be it a tariff war, a trade war or any other type of war, we’re ready to fight till the end.”
From his tough talk in early March to the Chinese Government’s quick response with equal tariffs (34%) to the U.S. measures, it seems that China is digging in for a trade war. (And, spoiler alert, it is OGL’s view that China holds the more powerful position in this trade war.)
How did China respond to Trump's tit-for-tat threat to increase U.S. tariffs on Chinese products by 50% if China implements its reciprocal tariffs?
Trump threatened China with an additional 50% tariff on goods imported into the United States after China said it would levy its own 34% counter-tariff. U.S. companies could see a total tariff rate of 104% on Chinese imports.
China responded to the threat by calling the U.S. a bully, and by determinedly staying its course and promising to implement a combination of diplomatic, economic, and retaliatory measures again the United States.
In a statement, the Commerce Ministry said the complaint against China was “completely groundless and is a typical unilateral bullying practice.”
“The countermeasures China has taken are aimed at safeguarding its sovereignty, security and development interests, and maintaining the normal international trade order. They are completely legitimate,” the ministry said. “The U.S. threat to escalate tariffs on China is a mistake on top of a mistake and once again exposes the blackmailing nature of the US. China will never accept this. If the U.S. insists on its own way, China will fight to the end.”
How will the two governments resolve the issue of Trump's tariffs?
The two powers will ultimately seek a negotiated resolution due to compelling structural imperatives. While Trump deploys tariffs as tools for excess benefits through coercive bargaining tactics, Beijing adopts a calculated "war-for-peace" strategy to safeguard its critical external market. In the upcoming negotiation, neither party wants to demonstrate weakness, and the process will be tough and lengthy.
Trump’s tariff policy seeks absolute trade balance in goods while ignoring America’s advantage and huge surplus in service trade. In contrast, while implementing countermeasures, Beijing has conveyed the message that economic laws will prevail, the complementarity between the two economies remains unchanged, China-US trade relations are resilient, and mutually beneficial cooperation is still the optimal solution for the two countries.
We will see now how China responds to President Trump’s “tough guy” tone and rhetoric. We do not think the US holds the advantage here, and we believe the US stands to suffer more in this trade war. The Trump Administration seems to believe differently. We will see.
