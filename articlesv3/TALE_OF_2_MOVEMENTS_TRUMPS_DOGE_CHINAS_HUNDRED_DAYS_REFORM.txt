### TALE OF 2 MOVEMENTS: TRUMP’S DOGE & CHINA’S “HUNDRED DAYS’ REFORM

At On Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy and, in particular, life in China. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. We have written about economic development in China and China’s economic reforms, U.S.-China relations, China’s changing role in the global political economy, and the history and current state of Chinese politics. We also like to add in historical and cultural reference points where they are relevant. In this post, we address a meme on Chinese social media, which has been comparing the Trump-Musk-DOGE Initiative to the “Hundred Days’ Reform” of the declining Qing Dynasty.
In two very different eras and governments, leaders have sought to streamline inefficient bureaucracies, only to face entrenched opposition and see their reforms threatened or even erased. The Hundred Days’ Reform of 1898 in China, also known as the Wuxu Reform, and the Trump administration’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) offer up striking parallels in the challenges of implementing rapid systemic change.
The Wuxu Reform was a political reform movement initiated by Emperor Guangxu of the late Qing Dynasty and under the advocacy of reform-minded intellectuals such as Kang Youwei and Liang Qichao, aiming to salvage the increasingly declining Qing Empire. Following the devastating defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government found itself not only at the mercy of its European powers but even its neighbor. This outcome underscored the urgent need for China to modernize its society in order to compete with other global powers.
The reformists advocated for Western-style modernization through scientific advancement, cultural renewal, and systemic reforms in governance and education. Emperor Guangxu issued over 100 reform decrees covering bureaucratic streamlining, industrial modernization, establishment of Western-style schools, and creation of a new-model army.
More than a century later, President Trump launched a sweeping effort to reduce government inefficiency through budget cuts, deregulation, and department streamlining. His DOGE initiative  -- under the watchful eye of billionaire Elon Musk -- has begun with fairly broad support within American society as voters responded to complaints about federal fraud, waste, and abuse. Like Trump’s dozens of executive orders, DOGE has stimulated extensive discourse and debate, as Musk has attempted to downsize agencies such as U.S.AID, the Department of Education, and the Environmental Protection Agency, as well as restructure federal programs, and shift responsibilities to states and the private sectors.
DOGE and its U.S. political reform endeavors have drawn comparisons on Chinese social media to an “American analogue of the Wuxu Reform.” However, given the divergent temporal contexts, institutional frameworks, and historical trajectories, such parallels are largely symbolic, invoking the archetypal narrative of radical reforms facing entrenched resistance.
Like the Trump administration, Emperor Guangxu’s measures threatened the interests of certain factions and the entrenched bureaucratic hierarchy, while failing to secure substantive provincial support. The reform movement lasted only 103 days before Empress Dowager Cixi, the de facto ruler of China, orchestrated the 1898 coup. She imprisoned the emperor, exiled Kang Youwei and Liang Qichao, and executed Tan Sitong and other five reformers, known as the “Six Martyrs of the Wuxu Reform.” China’s domestic historiography values this reform as an intellectual awakening that laid the ideological groundwork for subsequent revolutions, marking a crucial step in China’s modernization.
The Wuxu Reform movement centered on three key figures: Emperor Guangxu (aged 27), Kang Youwei (40), and Liang Qichao (25). They spearheaded radical reforms inspired by Western political thought. While Kang and Liang sought to establish a constitutional monarchy framework, Emperor Guangxu aimed to reassert imperial authority through the reforms. However, multiple constraints doomed the movement to failure:
Strategic Miscalculations in Political Maneuvering. The reformists demonstrated a lack of gradualist approach, implementing massive layoffs in bureaucratic restructuring that directly threatened vested interests. This radical downsizing triggered immediate backlash from conservative forces, exemplified by the overnight dismissal of six ministries which destabilized the entire mandarinate system.Disjuncture in Contextualizing National Realities. Their uncritical adoption of Western institutions overlooked the unique complexities of China’s agrarian society. Economic reforms prioritized industrial modernization while neglecting rural infrastructure and peasant subsistence needs, thereby undermining the social foundation of the reforms.Precarious Power Foundations. Lacking substantial bureaucratic support and provincial coordination, the reformers relied exclusively on the emperor’s symbolic authority. This “reform by decree” model rapidly collapsed in the face of conservative countermeasures.

Already, just 45 days into his new term, Trump has begun to face institutional pushback from Congress, the courts, and career bureaucrats. Many of his efficiency measures have been challenged in court, and are likely to be overturned or diluted. As Musk himself acknowledged: “This is work that will make countless enemies,” underscoring that the success or failure of these efforts may serve as a litmus test for the resilience of the American political system.
The Empress’s attitude toward the reform shifted from initial lukewarm acquiescence to vehement opposition, ultimately determining the movement’s outcome. Similarly, self-strengthening officials like Li Hongzhang and Zhang Zhidong exhibited ambivalence. Initially, they offered measured endorsement of select reform initiatives, but later developed profound skepticism and resistance to radical institutional changes, driven by bureaucratic conservatism and factional survival concerns.
The DOGE initiatives may, indeed, be flailing. With a tsunami of unjustified layoffs, and emails forcing federal employees to defend their value, the DOGE effort appears haphazard and incongruous. While the stated rationales are about cutting spending and making the U.S. government more efficient, it may also be the case that the Musk-model has already swerved far out of control in a few short weeks.
Emperor Guangxu’s vision laid groundwork for China’s later modernization, and Trump’s cuts could leave lasting policy shifts, yet both efforts underscore a historical truth: bureaucratic inertia is a formidable force, and efficiency reforms rarely outlive their architects. Perhaps DOGE is America’s version of the Hundred Days’ Reform, and Trump is awaiting the fate of the emperor and his reforms. Only time will tell.
