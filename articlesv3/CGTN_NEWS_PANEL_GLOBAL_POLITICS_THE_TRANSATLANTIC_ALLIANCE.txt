### CGTN NEWS PANEL: GLOBAL POLITICS & THE TRANSATLANTIC ALLIANCE

28 February 2025|China, Geopolitics, US politics
At On Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy and, in particular, life in China. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. We share our expertise about economic development in China and China’s economic reforms, U.S.-China relations, China’s changing role in the global political economy, and the history and current state of Chinese politics. We also aspire to help our Chinese audience understand broader changes in the global political economy. In this episode, OGL’s Guthrie joins Kathleen Burk, Professor Emeritus of Modern and Contemporary History, University College London and Christis Tombazos, Associate Professor at Monash University, to discuss the crisis of the Transatlantic Alliance. The panel is interviewed by China Global Television Network host, Ding Heng. To listen to the show, presshere.
