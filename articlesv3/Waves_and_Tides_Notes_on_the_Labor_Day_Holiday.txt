### Waves and Tides: Notes on the Labor Day Holiday

15 May 2020|China, Public Health
AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy and, in particular, life in China. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with a deep boots-on-the-ground experience. In this post, we rely one of our partners, Chris Gao, to delve into how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected consumer behavior in China. In particular, this post focuses on the creation of a “Mini Golden Week” in the wake of the pandemic lock down. The growth of a consumption culture in China is a very important part of China’s transition to a consumption-based growth economy, so the government is working hard to continue the development along these lines, even in these trying times. Gao uses the launching of the controversial “Waves Behind” video, an allusion to the famous Song Dynasty poem about waves and tides and transitions in life, to explore the current generational zeitgeist.—The Editorial Team
Mini Golden Week
Although past Labor Day holidays lasted five days, only May 1 was actually a public holiday this year in China. Unlike in the United States where Labor Day is supposed to honor workers but really signals the end of summer and the beginning of the school year, in China, Labor Day is the beginning of Golden Week and a green light to travel and an exciting shopping holiday.
To create a five-day Mini Golden Week, officials turned April 25 and May 9 into working days in exchange for two off days on May 4 and May 5. The holiday covered two important festivals in China, Labor Day on May 1 and Youth Day on May 4. In 1999, in order to stimulate consumption after the Asian Financial Crisis, the Labor Day holiday was increased from a single day to three days to make a seven-day Golden Week. Then in 2008, Labor Day was cut back to one day. While many might have assumed the change was made in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, the 2020 arrangement of a Mini Golden Week was announced by the State Council at the end of 2019. If the epidemic had occurred earlier, it would be hard to predate the fate of this year’s Mini Golden Week.

The most important reason for reducing the Labor Day holiday from three days to one is to distribute public holidays more evenly throughout the year, and reduce the spike that people all over the country travel during the Golden Week, making all major scenic spots overcrowded. Three traditional Chinese festivals—Qing Ming Festival in April, Dragon Boat Festival in June, and Mid-Autumn Festival in September or October—then became public holidays. Another reason is said to be related to Youth Day. The May 1st Golden Week has diluted the importance of May 4th Youth Day. Some experts invoked that the patriotic and progressive spirit of the May Fourth Movement should be vigorously promoted. Although commemorative events were moved forward to the end of April, a few experts still thought they were not as meaningful as being held on May 4th.I don't know what these experts would think about Mini Golden Week and the Youth Day now.
55 Shopping Festival
The epidemic appears to be under control, but the impact is still lingering. In Shanghai and some other provinces, a lotof enterprises and organizations stipulated that staffs must receive approval in advance if they wanted to leave their province during the holiday, and they must be isolated at home for 14 days after returning. Therefore, during the Mini Golden Week, most Shanghai residents picked shopping and dining in town instead of traveling outside the city.

The largest economic center in China, Shanghai is also a city with the strongest consumption power. In 2019, Shanghai's total retail sales of consumer goods reached 1.35 trillion yuan (USD$195.6 billion), ranking No. 1 among all Chinese cities. Shanghai's final consumption has already contributed more than 70 percent of the city’s GDP. The epidemic has had a significant damage to Shanghai’s economy. In the first quarter of 2020, the GDP of Shanghai fell by 6.7 percent compared to same period last year, and the total retail sales of consumer goods fell by 20.4 percent.
In order to stimulate and revitalize the city’s consumption, the Shanghai Government launched "55 Shopping Festival", in a hope of making up the loss through a combination of substantial discounts, consumer coupons, and the holiday traffic. 55 Shopping Festival was personally promoted by Shanghai party chief Li Qiang (李强), according to local media. Li and newly appointed Deputy Mayor Gong Zheng (龚正) belong to the "New Army of Zhejiang" (之江新军). They encouraged and witnessed the growth of Alibaba and its 1111 Shopping Festival when they were officials in Zhejiang Province.

From fashion apparel to latest-model cars, from catering to audio books, from star-rated hotels to discounted air tickets, from major e-commerce platforms to brick and mortar stores, B2C product and service providers have extensively participated in the shopping festival. One prominent advantage of the festival being named “55” (double five) is that it is easy to promote: making a cost-effective purchase at 55 percent of normal pricing during “55 Shopping Festival” that starts on May 5.
Founded in 2015 in Shanghai, Pinduoduo (拼多多, PDD) is an e-commerce platform that allows users to participate in group-buying deals. On May 4 and May 5, General Motors and Volkswagen arranged popular models of the Cadillac and Tiguan to be sold on the PDD platform at 45 percent discount. Eighty-five vehicles were sold within seconds. Sports footwear giant New Balance made a gimmick of their “55”. For the first item, you pay normal price, the second item is discounted 90 percent. In the fine print, they mention that the” discount applies to lower-priced item”.

The shopping festival is supported by government and business, and has both online and offline components. Top officials of each district recommend local specialties and services of their regions, business entities lower their margins and leave the benefits to consumers. Shanghai's largest fish market is located in the Baoshan District. At the opening of the shopping festival on the night of May 4, Baoshan party chief personally promoted an Argentine prawn store in the fish market. With a joint combination of official support and a discounted price (45 percent off), some 13,000 orders were placed within an hour. A total of 26 tons of shrimp were sold at a price 99 rmb/2kgs. Since the official kickoff of the festival at 8 p.m. on May 4, combined retail sales in Shanghai reached 10 billion yuan (USD$1.41 billion) by 2:12 p.m. on May 5.
There is no doubt that the shopping festival helps to boost people’s confidence in the economy and bring back their enthusiasm for consumption. My feeling is that the traffic in major shopping malls during the holiday is close to the level of normal years. In this challenging economic environment, the success of the shopping festival shows that people still have the willingness and capability to “buy, buy, buy”. The public needs excitement, which the government should support, and business will make it happen.
If PDD, a new riser in e-commerce, grabs attention from industry leaders like Alibaba and Jingdong (JD) during the shopping festival, Bilibili (哔哩哔哩nicknamed as Site B), which launched the controversial video "Waves Behind"(后浪), is surfing at high tide in the viral marketing. "Waves behind" comes from a poem in the Song Dynasty(宋朝) of China, "Waves behind push waves before in the Yangtze River, new people replace old people in life." (“长江后浪推前浪，浮事新人换旧人“).

The two-minute video was first broadcast before the 7 p.m. "CCTV News Broadcast"(新闻联播) on May 3. Price of the advertisement for this time frame in 2019 was reported as high as USD$26,000 every 10 seconds. The video’s voice over features an older actor who solemnly pronounces: “…One day, I finally discovered not only are we teaching you how to live, but you are inspiring us to live a better life as well. Those who speculate about the younger generations are inferior to those who come before them, should observe you, just like I am doing now, full of gratitude…“
A three-minute extended version of “Waves Behind” went online at Site B. Because the audiences of Site B are mainly young people, plus the video was posted on the eve of Youth Day, “Waves Behind” quickly ignited social media and went viral. Many people see themselves as part of the waves; some people hate it, this greedy capital’s chicken soup arouses their dissatisfaction with life, though many of them can be labeled “waves behind”. Like it or not, “Waves Behind” turned out to be the most dazzling star of the holiday. It is reported that the video exceeded 1 million views within 3 hours after its launch on Site B. As of May 8, its views exceeded 17 million at Site B. It is more important to understand how to live better in the real world.
Compared to eBay and Amazon, Alibaba and JD are waves behind; compared to Alibaba and JD, PDD is a wave behind; compared to Tencent and NetEase, Site B is a wave behind. It all depends on your perspective. Consider the metaphor in terms of people and cities. Compared to young influencer marketers, heavy duty district cadres are waves behind in front of live cameras; compared to City of Hangzhou where Alibaba is headquartered, Shanghai is a wave behind. The key factors to distinguish “waves before” and” waves behind” are not age, history, nor the scale of the company, city or country. The true characteristics are whether they have the ability to innovate, the courage to take risks, their attitudes toward failure, and if they have an open and inclusive mind. Without these characteristics, one will die on the beach, regardless of whether they are “waves before” or “waves behind”. With these features, you can surf the tide of your time, no matter if you are a 20-year-old graduate, a 50-year-old business person, or an 80-year-old politician.
