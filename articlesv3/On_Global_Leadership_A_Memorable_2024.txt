### On Global Leadership: A Memorable 2024

22 December 2024|OGL, OGL Courses
As we close the chapter on 2024, it’s the perfect time to reflect on OGL achievements, challenges, and growth that defined this year. From groundbreaking projects and innovative strategies to overcoming unexpected hurdles, 2024 has been a year of milestones and lessons learned. This retrospective highlights the significant successes that propelled us forward, the teamwork that made it all possible, and the valuable insights gained along the way.
The past 12 months have been a fascinating and, at times, tense chapter in the evolving story of U.S.-China relations. At On Global Leadership (OGL), our commitment to shedding light on the intricacies of China’s rise and its impact on the global political economy has taken center stage. Through a mix of analysis and firsthand experiences, we’ve aimed to provide clarity on these critical global dynamics.
Our journey began with a series of public events, co-hosted with the Thunderbird School of Global Management Foreign Policy Initiative and the Chinese Chamber of Commerce, Arizona. These gatherings explored the multifaceted nature of Chinese investments in the United States, with a particular focus on Arizona.
Each event brought together a diverse assembly of thought leaders, industry experts, and community figures, creating a rich tapestry of insights.
Notably, our final series event of the year, held on December 3, 2024, was a resounding success. Featuring speakers like John Lee, President of the Chinese Chamber of Commerce, Arizona, and Barry Wong, Chairman of Global Ties Arizona, the event offered a masterclass in collaborative dialogue. Panelists such as John McKiel and Antonio Yung brought their extensive expertise in facilitating Chinese investments in U.S. markets, fostering a discussion that was both profound and actionable.
Beyond Arizona, our endeavors expanded to the Bay Area, where OGL Chairman Doug Guthrie addressed Chinese entrepreneurs eager to navigate the complexities of U.S. markets. Hosted by the LeadPath organization, the dialogue underscored the opportunities and challenges inherent in cross-border investments, further cementing the importance of fostering understanding and collaboration.
Simultaneously, we ventured into the digital realm with the launch of a cutting-edge course, “U.S.-China Relations and Technology.” Designed in partnership with Christine Ying and Martin Wang, this course dissected pivotal technological intersections, such as Apple’s operations in China, TikTok’s challenges in the U.S., and TSMC’s strategic moves in Phoenix. It was a powerful reminder of how technology continues to reshape the geopolitical landscape.
Our content creation efforts also took a leap forward. With the revamp of the OGL YouTube channel, spearheaded by Christine Ying and supported by Florian Nguyen, we brought nuanced discussions to a global audience. From President Biden’s meeting with Xi Jinping in Peru to Tim Cook’s engagements in China, our videos captured the pulse of U.S.-China dynamics with clarity and depth.
Yet, amidst the milestones, we also faced moments of profound loss. This year marked the passing of Diane Long, a cherished member of our China team who brought 40 years of insights from her time in China to our work and whose legacy continues to inspire us. As we close out 2024, we reflect on her contributions and those of one of our founding partners, Craig Markus, who we lost in 2023. Their spirits remain an integral part of our journey.
Join us in celebrating a year of progress and setting the stage for even greater accomplishments in the future. Looking ahead, we embrace 2025 with a sense of purpose and optimism, ready to deepen our impact and expand the dialogue on global leadership. For those who have journeyed with us, we extend our gratitude and invite you to continue shaping the narrative of these critical times alongside us.
