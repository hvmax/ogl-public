### The Future is About Collaborative Innovation

24 August 2020|China, China history, China politics, Innovation, Leadership Development
AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy and, in particular, life in China. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. We have sought to advance a conversation about leadership in these times of crisis, economic development in China, and building sustainable capitalism. We are also building an economic database of cities in China to better understand how jurisdictions cope with today’s economic and political forces. In this post, we dive into the discussion of innovation in China with a focus on autonomous driving vehicles. – The Editorial Team
In the summer of 1967, the World’s Fair, held in Montreal, Canada, celebrated the theme “Man and His World.” At that time, it was the U.S. Pavilion that drove imaginations. The United States was proudly showcasing the “Genius of American Creativity,” as represented by the soon-to-be launched Lunar Landing Module. They were heady times and the world knew the U.S. was a world leader of innovation, finance, and culture.

Fast forward to Expo 2010, hosted by China in Shanghai. The theme was “Better City, Better Life” where technology was again the star of the show. This time, instead of leading, the U.S. almost didn't even make it. If it weren’t for the personal intervention of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the U.S. would have been MIA. In the end, the U.S.’s lackluster pavilion was essentially one large billboard for the U.S. companies that paid for it.
The opportunity to learn and be inspired by the extravaganza of technologies was not lost on 1.4 billion Chinese. The experience began immediately upon entering the park as one climbed aboard the eerily silent electric buses that carried attendees around the expo. The “Urban Best Practices” area focused on engineering prowess for managing metropolises such as Rotterdam’s water management, a city below sea level, similar to Shanghai. Italy’s creativity in product design was a must-see pavilion, with three-hour-long queues.
School groups from every province in the nation were sent by bus, train, and airplane to be exposed to a vision of the future. Expo programming swamped the television airways. The entire nation got the message: The future was going to be collaborative, coordinated, connected—and Chinese.
China’s So-called Lack of Innovation
It is a common trope to refer to China’s lack of innovation. Scholars from William Hennessey to Austin Williams to Gordon Mathews and many others have written extensively about China’s shanzhai movement and China’s “copycat” culture. Professor William Alford’s brilliant treatise on the history of intellectual property in China suggests that the copycat issues run deep in Chinese history and culture.
The topic, however, extends beyond a simple discussion of copying and (dis)respect for intellectual property (IP). The real issue is about innovation and China’s capacity tocreate. In a wide-ranging article written in 2014 on the topic of innovation in China, Regina Abrami, William Kirby, and F. Warren McFarlan summarized the literature and popular views this way: “Today… many believe that the West is home to creative business thinkers and innovators, and that China is largely a land of rule-bound rote learners – a place where R&D is diligently pursued but breakthroughs are rare.”[1]
After marching through several arguments and examples describing the barriers to entrepreneurialism and innovation in China including emphasizing engineering over design thinking, the government’s lack of protection for IP, and the exam-oriented education system, the authors go on to conclude:
“Certainly, China has shown innovation through creative adaptation in recent decades, and it now has the capacity to do much more. But can China lead? Will the Chinese state have the wisdom to lighten up and the patience to allow the full emergence of what Schumpeter called the true spirit of entrepreneurship? On this we have our doubts.”[2]
These scholars are not lacking in historical knowledge. They are esteemed China thinkers, each with long resumes of nuanced work on China, and they concede in their article that for about two thousand years, China was the most open and innovative economy in the world. China is the economic superpower that delivered such innovations as the compass, paper (including paper money), printing, and gunpowder – the “Four Greats of innovation” (四大发明). The concept of the “Four Greats” is originally a European idea, where 19th century scholars marveled at the power of European innovation, as seen in the revolutionary inventions, the nautical compass, gunpowder, the printing press, and the mass production of paper.
As noted by Sinologists in the late 19th century, beginning with Joseph Edkins, all of these “great” inventions actually originated in China centuries before they appeared in Europe.[3] Thus, these authors, while not lacking in historical knowledge, are sorely lacking in sociological, cultural, and analytic perspective. The question is not whether China was the most innovative and entrepreneurial economy in the world for those two thousand years – it was. The questions are: (1)whywas China so innovative for two thousand years; (2)whatstructural changes occurred to make the country lose its innovative spirit; and (3)willthat spirit re-emerge givennewstructural circumstances?
It is too easy to say the oppressive Chinese government is stifling an innovative spirit. Abrami and colleagues seem to have adopted a view of economic reform that tacitly accepts the views of economists Adam Smith, Milton Friedman, and Jeffrey Sachs. Their pronouncement is get the government out of the way and let the invisible hand of the market unleash the entrepreneurial spirit. But what China has achieved over the last 40 years has been truly remarkable, preciselybecauseof its gradual approach to economic reform. The Chinese Government still looks (and in many ways is) oppressive, but it’s also been gradually and steadily unleashing China’s entrepreneurial and innovative culture.
Recreating the Process
A decade after those wide-eyed kids walked into Expo 2010, they are now university researchers and young entrepreneurs recreating the promise of that vision. And nowhere was that potential more exciting than the Automotive Pavilion where a collaborative vision of a connected world was demonstrated by Shanghai Motor Corporation Limited (SAIC) and its joint venture partner General Motors (GM). The promise was an urban landscape of autonomous vehicles (AV). China did not let the fact that it spent 30 years building a legacy automobile industry worth USD320 million in revenues slow it down. It is actively creating the future, which includes connected electric vehicles (EVs), the Internet of Things (IoT), and a new idea – transportation as a service. It even dared ask whether it is necessary for every family and individual to own a car.
The AV of the future will be the largest consumer smart device in the new world of IoT. Integrated circuits make up the sensors that communicate via the Internet to the cloud, to other cars, and to smart roads. This in turn generates data, lots of data that must be collected and shared in real time with other vehicles on the road, control centers, and passengers. Enter 5G. The current 4G system can’t handle this quantity of data at the speed needed to tie the entire ecosystem together, and ensure that communications are smooth and instantaneous.
It is no question that American companies are leading the way with Waymo, the Google driver-less car project begun in 2009, which is the acknowledged leader. Cruise, a company with big investments from GM, Softbank, Honda, and others, has 180 AVs on the road under test conditions. The Chevy Bolt, which shares its genetic makeup with a regular car, has been refitted with the necessary digital connectors and sensors to make it autonomous. And don’t forget Tesla.
While those companies obviously will focus on the vehicle itself, Lyft and Uber are leading with software communication systems on a testing ground in Concord, California, which is east of San Francisco and owned by the American Automobile Association (AAA). Known as “GoMomentum”, more than 5,000 acres were designed to recreate a real transportation experience with bridges, dividers, cyclists, and even animal crossings.
China takes a backseat to no one, though. Chinese consumers are some of the fastest first adopters  in the world, harnessing the energy and enthusiasm for a new technology through both domestic and international collaboration. For the Chinese investors, it is not an esoteric research project. California maybe the birthplace of AI technology, which forms the foundation of the AV industry, but commercialization for the road is the end game in China. The major Chinese AV projects were “born” in Silicon Valley, and they know the landscape will be different in China. The focus now is to move aggressively to commercialization. This is the Chinese strength – speed to market. The drive to be first in China makes this an exciting time to watch China’s formidable competitive players. They do not expect to do it alone. Collaboration is a critical component of success.
WeRide, a robo-taxi service.
WeRide, a robo-taxi service.
For example, WeRide is an internationally recognized AV project, which opened global headquarters in Guangzhou in December 2017. Tony Han, the Chinese CEO, recruited engineers who had studied in the U.S. and worked for tech companies such as Google, Microsoft, and Cisco. But they also hired engineers from China’s Baidu and DiDi. Educated at some of the finest computer science programs in the U.S., the engineers worked from an R&D center in Silicon Valley as well as operating divisions in Beijing and Shanghai. The product is an all-in-one algorithm solution, which is the fundamental building block of the AI technology that drives the AV industry. WeRide is the first mobility-solution company to obtain approval to launch a trial of a robo-taxi service to the public in China. In Guangzhou, one can download an app to order a car within a geographic area. It is expected to expand its fleet to more than 100 in 2020.
Listening to CEO Tony Hanthe, one is struck by the confidence, the energy, and the vision for the future. It’s about partnerships and collaboration as he signs agreements with strategic investors such as Renault Nissan Mitsubishi Alliance as well as OEM manufacturers such as Johnson Electric. At the premiere GPU Technology Conference (GTC) in Silicon Valley to promote  WeRide technology, collaborating with Nvidia, a Silicon Valley tech giant, one is struck by the similar shared vision of the future. The goal is to change the world, and be the first to commercialization. So, they are busy collecting miles like a pilot building flight hours, resulting in an ever-growing collection of data, which is used in turn to formulate the algorithm to ensure it can operate cars safely in the Chinese environment. In less than three years, WeRide has accumulated 1,500,000 test kilometers, signed numerous partnerships in an attempt to build the smart transportation ecosystem, and become an established leader in China.
But this not a direct competitor business model.  Chinese like to break the rules. AutoX, which has a potpourri of investors such as MediaTek, Shanghai Auto (SAIC), Dongfeng Auto and Alibaba, was started in 2016. In April of 2020, AutoX deployed a fleet of 100 self-driving vehicles in Jiading, a district of Shanghai. AutoX is using the mapping service app, AutoNavi, depending on Alibaba’s own super-computing data ability. The company's Operation Center in Shanghai is billed as "the largest data hub" in China. Even so, Alibaba is also collaborating with WeRide to use Alibaba’s Amap to augment the mobility service offerings in Guangzhou.
Baidu China, a major online search engine, launched its Apollo robo-taxi service in Changsha, Hunan Province in September 2019. It exists within an 80-square-mile area of the city, and opened to the public in April 2020 making it the first publicly available autonomous taxi service in China with a fleet of 45 vehicles. Additionally, Baidu is test driving the same service in other cities like Beijing.
The Chinese ride-hailing company, Didi, which manages about 10 billion rides per year across the globe, joined in with its autonomous-driving division, which has since spun off into a separate company. In May, Softbank’s Vision Fund dropped a USD$500 million investment into Didi Chuxing, and it has been working with Beijing Auto Group to jointly develop a purpose-built, self-driving vehicle. The Didi Chuxing Volvo can be seen and indeed, one can take test ride, in Jiading as well.
Standard Creation is an International Effort
The collaboration and coordination do not end with the on the ground eco-system. An important but not very sexy part of the revolution is what and how to establish standards by which AV can operate. This has significant implications on how different components interact, which in turn impacts which technology “wins” in the commercialization race, which further impacts where and how its produced.
Meetings of the United Nations European (UNECE) World Forum for Harmonization of Vehicle Regulations has official representation from 53 different countries—not just from Europe but also from Africa and Asia. China, while not an official member of this consortium, does send representatives to participate in discussions. It fully understands that if it wants to have an impact, it should have a seat at the table. The U.S. is another high-profile country that is not a member, but it’s not clear if the U.S. attends or not.
The first regulations created by the UNECE are the binding rules on Automated Lane Keeping Systems (ALKS), which will come into force in January 2021. The ALKS outlines the controls of the vehicle with a driver behind the wheel and the seatbelt on. The roads themselves must be divided highways that separate traffic moving in opposite direction, and does not allow pedestrians and cyclists. They also established a speed limit of 60 kilometers (37 miles) per hour.
“This is the first binding international regulation on so-called 'Level 3' vehicle automation, marking an important step toward the wider deployment of automated vehicles globally to realize a vision of safer, more sustainable mobility for all,” UNECE said in a statement. Japan co-led the effort with Germany, alongside France, Canada, the Netherlands, and the European Commission. Without an international effort to establish consistent standards, it will be challenging for AV and its accompanying technologies  to be used across borders. The lack of U.S. government participation at this stage will drive American AV companies to go it alone, attending as private participants and working to enforce what will essentially be public projects when time comes to build smart roads.
For example, the AV standards must define levels of automation, what those levels are called, and what the capability of the vehicles are at each level. The EU standard uses five levels. Indeed, in public articles and AV company websites, the nomenclature reflect 5 levels. At Level 3, the driver is not driving when the automated systems are engaged but is at the ready to step in at any time to take over at the system's request. A Level 4 driver need not be ready to quickly intervene, at least in limited areas. At Level 5, vehicles are fully autonomous.
A comparison of the U.S. Department of Transportation’s report, co-written with the White House in January 2020, says it all: “Ensuring American Leadership in Automated Vehicle Technologies 4.0.”  The Americans are advocating six levels of autonomous technology in the report. Tesla talked about its L2 technology while NVIDIA refers to L4 AI technologies. The U.S. has never aligned with the world on kilometers or weight scales. Will it make the same mistake on driver-less vehicles? Must the U.S. try to be the leader, even if no one wants to follow?
And if you should happen to think this is just esoteric bureaucratic work, labeling ones AV efforts L3 or L4 has a huge impact on the marketing efforts of the technology. This writer recently took a test ride on a Didi robo-taxi in Jiading outside of Shanghai. The safety drivers told us we were on a L4 ride. But as the driver never let his hands drop from the steering wheel and his foot was always hovering over the break, ready to take over in an instant, the experience was less than the billing. The competition in the Chinese market demands it be considered L4 because Baidu was already offering L4 and as described by riders, the safety driver never touched the steering wheel.
The Global Race is on
Make no mistake. This is a race to establish a leadership position in the  AV industry today and in the future. This is a complicated business, just like the vehicle itself with multi levels of technology working collaboratively to achieve success in every ecosystem. Future success is not about a single company but a platform that will necessitate collaboration across industriesandborders. Regardless of the controlling government system, the global vision driven by China is palpable, represented by energetic voices, speaking in perfect English, and not limited by the stress of geopolitics or history. Regardless of the number of times it’s repeated that the Chinese can’t innovate, disruption is in the air. Fasten your seat belts. We are in for a ride of a lifetime.
As one U.S. government official commented, “no company can lead in all aspects, but no one certainly wants to fall behind.” And China just might be the place where the dreams of those many minds a decade ago will bring that vision of 2010 to life.
