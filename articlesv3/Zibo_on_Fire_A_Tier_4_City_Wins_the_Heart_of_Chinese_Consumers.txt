8 May 2023|China, China Population, Culture
AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about life in China. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. We have sought to advance a conversation about the Chinese people and their lives today. To do so, we have counted on contributions from our China team, which tracks the pulse of China's innovations, consumer trends, and lives of Chinese people. This post adds to that conversation by looking at the near miraculous growth of Zibo as a tourist destination in recent months, thanks largely to its famous and tasty BBQ. – The Editorial Team
Because how, why, and where people vacation can tell you a lot about a society and a country, we're exploring here a great story out of Zibo in eastern China. Millions of domestic visitors have recently made Zibo, a previously little-known city, a destination for barbecue. Yes, BBQ!
Located in Shandong Province, Zibo (淄博) is categorized as a tier 4 city (1). In the spring of 2023, this city of 4.71 million unexpectedly stood out because of its barbecue and has become the most popular tourist destination in China. If you follow the Chinese economy -- and social media -- and you still haven't heard of Zibo, perhaps you need a new source of information.
During this year's May Day mini golden week (2), Zibo topped the Baidu Map of the "Top 15 Most Popular Tourist Cities" in China, beating traditional destinations such as Xi'an, Chengdu, Beijing, and Shanghai. Hotel bookings in Zibo rose 800% from 2019, and the city also topped train ticket searches in China.
Zibo is being described as "China's outdoor barbecue capital" in social media, and there are some 1,270 barbecue restaurants in the city, according to Zibo's Barbecue Association. The Zibo barbecue craze started in early March social media, and now that the May Day holiday is over, major barbecue markets in Zibo are still bustling.
“Zibo barbecue” remains a hot topic on social media. To most people’s surprise, the city has maintained a good reputation despite the massive surge in the number of tourists. The vast majority of netizens have a positive attitude toward the city. There are also a few offbeat voices that have their own takes on the Zibo phenomenon. Here are a few references:
Go (game) world champion Ke Jie said that although Zibo barbecue is indeed delicious, he still can’t understand why so many people go there: "some people line up before dawn, and wait till the evening, just for a barbecue supper?"Public opinion observerJiuwen Pinglun(旧闻评论)wrote：”The popularity of Zibo barbecue is actually something very boring. It is no real comfort to official's development anxieties, nor can it reduce the pressure of survival for ordinary people. (Our) society is sick and the popularity of barbecue is its symptom".For Wu Xiaobo, a financial writer, Zibo satisfies civilian’s imagination of the free market: “cheap but high-quality commodity, pleasant consumer experience, a market environment free from deception, and a small government that is humble and gentle.”

But how did Zibo rise to fame? For a city lacking tourism resources, it must have done something right and not just  because of some random coincidence. This is our analysis of the Zibo phenomenon:
Favorable timing.The Zibo barbecue craze is the epitome of China's post-COVID retaliatory consumption. After three years of strict epidemic prevention and control, people needed to relax, especially for college students who have more time but limited finances. In early March, when temperatures got warmer, college students in Jinan and other nearby cities rushed to Zibo, becoming the first wave of barbecue diners. The result was a social media tsunami, and Zibo exploded in popularity.
People didn't just come for the food, though. The crowd-gathering effect actually turned these open-air barbecue markets into acarnival or a music festival. Were we seeing the lipstick effect. with cash-strapped consumers buying inexpensive "luxury" items like a trip to Zibo for barbecue? Maybe. But in Zibo, tourists were also having a lot of fun.
Resource advantages.The success of Zibo barbecue, which has embraced the consumption trend of ordinary people, is inseparable from the advantages of the supply chain and the convenient transportation with high-speed rail.
Zibo is in one of the most densely populated areas in China, and high-speed rail makes it easy for people to enjoy short weekend trips. Jinan, the provincial capital 120 kilometers west of Zibo, has 700,000 college students. The students can travel to Zibo in 30 minutes by high-speed train, for a one-way ticket costing ￥40 (about $6), and then enjoy delicious barbecue for ￥50 (about $8). As marketers say, “Tasty barbecue that makes you full within 50 yuan!”
Zibo barbecue has secured its reputation for low-price meals because of Shandong's proximity to the food resources, which is hard for other cities to duplicate. It is a half-day delivery from the local supply chain (3): mutton from Dongying and Tai'an, green onions from Linyi, vegetables from Shouguang, pork from Weifang, Tsingtao beer, Laiyang peanut oil, etc. Even barbecue grills and outdoor tables and chairs are produced within the province. ThisSouth China Morning Postvideoshowcases the raucous barbecue atmosphere in Zibo.
A harmonious relationship between government and citizens.Along with price, people go to Zibo because of its hospitality, welcoming attitude, and sincerity. From citizens to the government, Zibo is committed to creating a good experience for tourists.
Super B (B太) is a blogger with close to 18 million fans on Douyin (TicTok is the international version of Douyin). On April 8, Super B (See Figure 4) took an electronic scale to 10 barbecue stalls in Zibo to see if he could find anyone shorting the weight of the product, and not a single stall had problems. Without a doubt, the research by Super B went viral and Zibo exploded again on social media.
The local government swiftly jumped at the opportunity to expand its tourism draw, and it has taken a series of measures to preserve the city's sudden boom. It has arranged for volunteers at railway stations to greet visitors, opened barbecue trains, provided free barbecue bus lines, promptly investigated and handled any disputes, stipulated that the price increases at hotels during the holiday could exceed 50%. The Zibo police do not put tickets on illegally parked vehicles from outside the city. Instead, the police make calls to owners to persuade them to move. In addition, since 2019, some government buildings in Zibo have allowed pedestrians to enter and use toilets, and have let tourist vehicles park during non-working hours free of charge.
In China, scams are chronic in many tourist cities, and consumers have grown tired of fighting with illegal merchants. Zibo authorities have created a tourist-friendly environment, which is supported by local people and praised by tourists, regardless of the fact that many of its measures generally can only be implemented by a bigger city government.
Zibo has brought hope to many small and medium-sized cities in China. They may not have the big tech-companies, famous research institutes, or respected universities, but they can still build the social environment, business opportunities, and potential for development comparable to bigger cities. Before its unexpected popularity, Zibo was considered a "mediocre" city, with little sense of existence or uniqueness. The city obviously didn't take that sense to heart, and instead it has taken advantage of opportunities when they arise, even if they come from a barbecue grill. The people in Zibo know that the future of their city can't just rely on barbecue, but no one can ignore the potential the barbecue boom may bring to this old industrial city.
But that notion of taking advantage of opportunities when they arise is not restricted to Zibo or to barbecue. Two U.S. big box retailers, both of which operate on a membership model, have gotten competitive in China. Sam's Club and Costco are drawing  Chinese consumers who like the atmosphere as much as the prices at the warehouse clubs. While Sam's Club has 39 stores in China, Costco has just opened its third, though two others are quickly scheduled to open. They are popular and the market is massive, definitely an opportunity.
In evaluating China's economy through the Zibo phenomenon, some people see a half-full glass, and good signs of economic recovery, while others see a half-empty glass, and they question how long the fever can last, and how much spending can be unleashed by low-cost consumption like Zibo barbecue or "special-ops style travel"(5). Both views have a common problem: they only judge from the financials and not from the perspective of China's consumers.
One of our colleagues spoke with a Chinese radio podcast interview recently about the Zibo phenomenon, and his comments about the event can be foundhere.
During the recent May Day holiday, we saw barbecue fever, camping fever, and art exhibition fever (See Figure 5), and all suggest thatthe willingness of the Chinese people to consume has not decreased, but that the consumption patterns and societal and cultural structures are changing.Zibo has adapted to these changes, and the city is creating a consumption-friendly environment, and, in doing so, it has not let additional opportunities to woo tourists searching for meaning to slip away. This is our reading of the Zibo phenomenon.
1. According toRanking of Chinese Cities' Business Attractiveness 2022, released by Yicai Media Group, Zibo is a level 3 city, after 4 level-1 cities, 15 new-level-1 cities and 30 level-2 cities.https://m.thepaper.cn/baijiahao_18430126
2. Though only May 1 is a public holiday, a five-day mini golden week is created by switching May 2 and May 3 to off days. May Day and the surrounding holiday are considered prized shopping and entertainment days.
3. In 2022, Shandong Province's meat production (pork, beef, lamb and poultry) was 8.38 million tons, accounting for 9.1% of the total output of China.
4. Shanghai museum opened its doors to the public for 24 hours on May 7, an unprecedented practice, on the last day of the exhibition,From Botticelli to Van Gogh: Masterpieces from the National Gallery, London.
5. “Special-ops style travel” (特种兵式旅游) refers to a high-intensity tourism method that uses weekends or holidays to visit as many scenic spots as possible with minimum time and expense. It is quite popular among young people, especially college students in China.
