### CHINA. The Enduring and Uneven Sino-US Relationship

13 July 2020|China, China politics, US-China Relations
AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy and, in particular, life in China. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. We are building an economic database of cities in China to better understand how jurisdictions cope with today’s economic and political forces, as well. We have sought to advance a conversation about what leadership in these times of crisis might look like. In this post, one of our team members takes an historical look at US-China relations by recalling the work of the great Leighton Stuart and his commitment to China. – The Editorial Team

For the last 41 years, the relationship between China and the United States could be described as guarded yet optimistic. China and the West’s mutual desire for the economic benefits of globalization created balance and a certain level of goodwill, enough to calm the passionate naysayers on either side.
That calm has turned to enmity. Tensions between the US and China are at the highest levels since the Mao years. Things have turned precarious for a number of reasons including the trade war initiated by President Trump, the spread of the China-originated coronavirus, and the recent deployment of three US nuclear-powered aircraft carriers in the South China Sea.
What should the US and China do to moderate this fractious period? Many consider the best option for peace is hewing to the former status quo—a zero-sum game where each country’s gains or losses are balanced by the gains and losses of the other side.
The timing of a recent rebroadcasting by CCTV of the 48-episode TV series “Diplomatic Situation” (外交风云), which curiously coincided with a rare meeting between Secretary of State Pompeo a senior Chinese official, has reminded me of another time when US-Sino relations were equally challenging. The series tells the history of the People’s Republic of China from 1949 to 1976 through a series of major diplomatic events.

One of those episodes focused on the powerful story of the former U.S. ambassador to China, John Leighton Stuart (司徒雷登), and puts into graphic relief the Sino-US relationship over some three decades. It is compelling viewing because Stuart believed it was possible to find a diplomatic solution that allowed for a better United States, China, and the world.
In July 1946, still reeling from World War II, then President Harry Truman appointed Stuart. He was considered by many to be the best hope for peaceful relations between the two nations. Stuart was the rarest of diplomats, a native son of China. A second-generation missionary educator, he was fluent in Mandarin and founder of Yenching University (燕京大学). Stuart was admired, in part by the Chinese, because he had fiercely resisted Japanese aggression in China and was incarcerated for three years by the Japanese until August 1945.
As ambassador, Stuart advanced the notion that both countries could achieve great things if both countries sought alignment and opportunity--together. Of course, this message came on the heels of World War II and in the midst of China’s civil war. Mao was leading the Communists overthrow of the Kuomintang or Nationalist government of Chiang Kai-shek, which would eventually debark to Taiwan.
Stuart believed he could resolve the problems between the Kuomintang government and the Communists. He had ties to both sides, and he knew many of the Communists because they attended Yenching University. Stuart sought reforms from the Nationalists and a settlement from the Communists, hoping that the two factions could form one government.

“The whole nation wanted peace,” wrote Stuart in his memoir,Fifty Years in China. “The party members on both sides were a mere fraction of the huge, disorganized, inarticulate, amorphous population. These were neither Kuomintang nor Communists but merely Chinese desiring to be allowed to live their lives with a minimum of government interference or oppression.”
It became increasingly clear that his strategy of compromise wasn’t working. When the People's Liberation Army (PLA) traversed the Yangtse River and drove the colonial government out of Nanking, Stuart stayed in order to continue negotiations, but few had hope it would help. Soon enough, the Truman administration recalled him, and Stuart regretfully left China on August 2, 1949.
Three days later, the US State Department issued a 1,054-page white paper explaining Stuart’s exit from China and portraying Chiang Kai-Shek's Kuomintang regime as inefficient and corrupt and referring to the Communist Party of China’s (CPC) victory as "the fall of China to Communists.” The white paper notes: “This is a frank record of an extremely complicated and most unhappy period in the life of a great country to which the United States has long been attached by ties of closest friendship.”
Mao Zedong responded with his incisive and biting August 1949 essay, “Farewell, Leighton Stuart!” The essay took aim at the US (the “dictatorship of the bourgeoisie”) and celebrated the departure of Stuart from his homeland. The ending became a catchphrase in Chinese history books: “Leighton Stuart has departed, and the White Paper has arrived, very good, very good. Both events are worth celebrating.”
Mao also scathingly dismissed Stuart’s contention that it was possible to serve both countries. “…he used to pretend to love both the United States and China and was able to deceive quite a number of Chinese,” wrote Mao, noting that Stuart was a “symbol of the complete defeat of the U.S. policy of aggression.”
Stuart later wrote in his memoir, "I have felt acutely the irony of my having been my country's Ambassador to China at a time when all that I had previously accomplished in the country to which I was accredited was apparently being destroyed."
An Object Lesson
Thirteen years after leaving China, and without ever seeing his home country again, Stuart died of a heart attack in Washington, D.C. While he is a footnote in US history, generations of Chinese students read Mao’s essay and knew the name “John Leighton Stuart” as a symbol of US aggression and duplicity. He was a representative of imperialism and capitalism at a critical moment in China’s history.

In 2008, 46 years after his death, Stuart's ashes were finally laid to rest in a cemetery in Hangzhou, his birth city, which is about two hours south of Shanghai. His burial alongside his wife and parents was a signal Stuart’s reputation had been rehabilitated for repatriation. Local officials also built a statue in his honor--only one of  two foreigners so honored. (The other statue is of Marco Polo.)
Many Chinese citizens perceive the US today as preventing China from getting better, despite CPC’s successful policy of reform and opening up in the past 41 years. Although the US demands fully reciprocal dealings between the two nations across commercial, security, and diplomatic interactions, many Chinese, like their predecessors in 1949, feel that the US is not treating China equally. They are fond of quoting Mao’s unforgettable essay on social media: “Let them blockade us for eight or ten years! By that time all of China’s problems will have been solved.”
At the same time, many Americans are upset that China walks its own path, and they are angry that China’s rise has not led to the future or the nation they expected. In a strategic document released by the Trump administration in May 2020, the White House noted: “It is time the United States rethink the failed policies of the past two decades – policies based on the assumption that engagement with rivals and their inclusion in international institutions and global commerce would turn them into benign actors and trustworthy partners… [T]he PRC’s rapid economic development and increased engagement with the world did not lead to convergence with the citizen-centric, free and open order as the United States had hoped.”
The US-China relationship is once again at a crossroads. This time, many wonder whether the two countries can even afford to be de-coupled, as they were in 1949. If the people and governments of two great nations take “a better America,” “a better China,” and “a better World” as their goal, they might be able to find better ways to cooperate over the long term, as Stuart had hoped and so tirelessly worked for throughout his life.
