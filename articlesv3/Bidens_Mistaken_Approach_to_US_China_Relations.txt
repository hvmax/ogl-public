### Biden’s Mistaken Approach to U.S.-China Relations

9 August 2021|China, China politics, Geopolitics
AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy and, in particular, life in China. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. We have sought to advance a conversation about the U.S.-China relationship, and a deep understanding of local economic development in China. We write regularly about the U.S.-China relationship (e.g.,hereandhere), and the importance of theU.S.-China trading partnership. In this post, we continue the discussion on the evolving Biden Administration stance on China. – The Editorial Team
By The On Global Leadership Team
To be very clear from the outset, we are disappointed. Seriously disappointed. The United States is headed down a dangerous path with respect to the U.S.-China relationship. It is a path that could and should have been avoided. And, to be honest, we expected more from President Biden.
We were hopeful that the Biden Administration would be different. In the early days of the Biden Administration, we felt optimistic about the emergence from the Donald Trump-Peter Navarro debacle. As we wrote in a recent article… “To be sure, Biden is walking a tightrope. The current difficulties with China have been brewing at least since President Xi Jinping’s ascension in 2013, and perhaps go back as far as 2008 in the wake of the global recession… Biden could return to a more civil relationship with China and that would be good for the world and, likely, the people inside of China. However, there is pressure from inside the U.S. to continue the current tough-on-China stance. In recent weeks, there were positive signs of moving back toward cooperation when Biden sent Special Envoy for Environmental Affairs, John Kerry, to China. Kerry is widely respected in China, and the country’s netizens viewed this outreach as respectful. The message was that despite our differences, China and the U.S. can find areas to collaborate, for example, in the area of climate change. The fact that Xi attended Biden’s Climate Change Summit was a positive sign. A month later, U.S. Trade Representative, Ambassador Katherine Tai, reported ‘candid, pragmatic’ talks with her Chinese counterpart, Liu He. Another positive sign.”
Sadly, the last few months have signaled a serious turn, and we believe it is a turn for the worse. Much worse. First there was the aggressive and ill-conceived announcement by National Security Council Indo-Pacific Coordinator Kurt Campbell that the era of engagement was over. U.S.-China relations would now be defined by competition. Noted Campbell, “The period that was broadly described as engagement has come to an end… The dominant paradigm [going forward] is going to be competition.” This was followed by tough talk about two nations – and two systems – fighting for the position of global superpower. In its July 17th edition,The Economistargued: “Biden is converting Trumpian bombast into a doctrine that pits America against China, a struggle between rival political systems which, he says, can have only one winner. Between them, Mr. Trump and Mr. Biden have engineered the most dramatic break in American foreign policy in the five decades since Richard Nixon went to China.”
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken introduced a new notion into the U.S.-China conversation in March 2021, suggesting that the U.S. could choose when and how it would approach China. "Our relationship with China will be competitive when it should be, collaborative when it can be, and adversarial when it must be," said Blinken. "The common denominator is the need to engage China from a position of strength."
This statement by Blinken now suggests that the United States' approach to China has officially been upgraded from the past two-handed strategy to competition, cooperation and confrontation. In fact, competition plus cooperation is similar to engagement plus prevention. The biggest difference is the addition of "confrontation". This is tantamount to telling the outside world that this a change from U.S.-China relations of the past 40 years. We believe the relationship will be more intense in the future, potentially becoming more complex and severe.
Finally, Biden was recently talking threateningly about how cyberwarfare with Russia and China could lead to “a real shooting war.”  We have to ask: who do you have advising you about your China strategy? Campbell? U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tsai? Blinken? Please give them our numbers. We would like to help, as you are headed down a path that is not going to be good for anyone. When you add to all this the new arms deal with Taiwan, which Biden recently signed, things are really getting heated.
Taking a step back: We largely agree with the emerging framing of this debate from The Economist. We also want to contribute a few additional points of nuance. We focus here on three key issues: history, the interdependent nature of our economies, and the errant assumption that NATO allies with stay with the US.
First, a little history and the importance of respect in diplomatic relations with China. In 1424 – the early Ming Dynasty – China was, by far, the most powerful nation on the planet. At that time, China produced about one-third of the global Gross Domestic Product (GDP), and for over a millennium China had been far and away the most innovative economy in the world, producing such transformational inventions as the printing press, gun powder, the nautical compass, paper money. China also had the world’s most powerful armada by orders of magnitude – Admiral Zheng He used to set sail on Chinese voyages that would include hundreds of vessels with maritime technology that Europe would not see for three centuries. Following the death of Emperor Yongle in 1424, China took a dramatic turn inward, just as Europe was entering its mercantilist and colonial phase of exploration. China’s dark period would include two Opium Wars, the fall of the Sino-Japanese War, the Boxer Rebellion, the fall of Imperial China, World Wars I and II, the Communist Revolution, the famine of the Great Leap Forward, in which 50 million Chinese citizens died of starvation, and the social destruction of the Cultural Revolution. It was an extended dark period in the history of this once-powerful nation.
It also owned the most world’s most powerful navy. However, after an inward turn in the early Ming, China’s position in the world vis-à-vis the West weakened. And it suffered many abuses at the hands of the West in the late Qing and post imperial eras, leading to what is now referred to as the “Century of Humiliation” (百年国耻).
These points are important, because, historically, this is how China sees itself. It sees itself as a major global superpower deserving of respect that is equal to the other global superpowers in the world. From 1839-1979, China suffered a great many calamities. However, in the four decades since the economic reforms began, China been far and away the most successful case of the transition from a planned to market economy. In 1979, the former’s Soviet Union’s GDP was  No. 2 in the world; today, China’s economy is #2 in the world, with a GDP 13 times that of Russia. Over the last 40 years, China has also lifted more people out of poverty than any nation on the planet. Despite the fact that it is soon to be the largest economy in the world, China has never been invited to the G7 meeting of nations, relegated instead to the 2nd tier G20 meetings. (We note here that the G7 was founded as a club of the world’s major industrialized countries. However, it was also built as a coalition of wealthy liberal democracies, so perhaps it makes sense that China, still a communist authoritarian nation, is not invited to the table. However, the notion of such a club of “major” industrialized nations refuses to include the soon-to-be-largest economy in the world seems rather out of date.)
Finally, the fact that China was treated the way it was during the Trump administration was simply diplomatically embarrassing. Having then Trade Representative Peter Navarro as a central figure in U.S.-China trade discussions was an astounding decision. The idea that we would have as a lead negotiator with our largest trading partner a person who had written a xenophobic and sensationalistic book about China – a book that is rife with inaccuracies and unsubstantiated accusations (and one in which it was later revealed that the so-called scholar Navarro made up his sources) – indicates that the Trump administration had little interest in respectful diplomatic talks with the world’s soon-to-be largest economy. Respect and “face” matter in Chinese diplomatic relations and placing an incendiary pundit like Navarro in a lead position here sent a very clear message to China that the U.S. had little interest in working together in pursuing positive shared outcomes. Great damage was done in the years between 2016-2020.
Second, economics. Let’s be clear about one thing: Chinawillbecome the largest economy in the world (probably in 2028); it is going to pass the United States, and, within a decade, it is not even going to be close. (If you measure the economies by real GDP, which adjusts for purchasing power parity, instead of nominal GDP, China’s economy is already the largest in the world. Now in terms of per capita GDP, of course the United States is a much richer nation, but that is a different question.)
But it is also an economy on which many companies (and nations) are dependent, and that is not going to change anytime soon. There are two reasons for this. First, the size of the market: as the most populous nation on the planet and one with a fast-growing middle class, China represents massive opportunities for many major companies around the world (e.g., Apple, Tesla, VW). For many of the world’s premium brands, China is the first or second largest market. The second issue here is that China has built the world’s most complex and efficient manufacturing supply chain, an issue that many American politicians seem not to understand.
There is another part of this story that has to do with labor. In China’s powerful manufacturing economy, one of the critical forces is the massive migrant labor force, about 300 million people moving around the country providing a “seasonal” labor force spread across China’s integrated supply chain. For years, the so-called floating population (流动人口) has fueled the Chinese manufacturing miracle. In addition, China’s integrated manufacturing supply chain is the most powerful, diverse, and competitive in the world. Many observers think companies could simply find suppliers in other countries – Trump famously exhorted Apple to simply get Foxconn to build a factory in Wisconsin and thus manufacture iPhones in the United States. This is such a simplistic and inane understanding of how products like these are made. Apple and companies like it work with hundreds of factories across the supply chain in China, all of which compete for contracts in the production of components, modules, and final assembly. Yes, Foxconn is a large final assembly partner, but it is just one ofmanyfactories in an integrated supply chain. For many of these companies, there is no way that Western companies are going to walk away from China.
Further, we believe that China’s economy is built for economic development. As we have written in otherposts, “In reality, local governments at provincial, city, district and county levels are the engines driving China’s powerful system of economic growth. Indeed, the Chinese government is an extremely decentralized and entrepreneurial system of district and township governments. Beyond China’s Central Government, the country is made up of 31 provincial level units – generally large bodies of land (like states in the U.S.), though there are also four provincial-level municipalities included in this group (Beijing, Chongqing, Shanghai, and Tianjin). Below these provincial units are about 800 municipalities, which are segmented into district governments. The mayors of China’s districts and townships behave like corporate CEOs, focusing on KPIs, pursuing foreign investment, and advancing their own careers through the financial and economic achievements in their jurisdictions. It is crucial that their actions and goals line up with the municipalities and provinces under which they reside (and ultimately with the national plans), but they are given discretion and incentives to make they own localities achieve those goals. In this sense, to carry forward the firm metaphor, district heads are probably most like VPs of business units – they must deliver against the strategic plans of the holding company (the Central Government) and the corporation (the provincial or municipal government), but they also have a significant amount of autonomy to run their business units (their district governments) as they see fit.”
As a final point, we just don’t believe that the NATO alliance is going to hold. We have written previously about theChina-EU allianceand also about China’s deep investment in theBelt and Road Initiative. But we also think it is clear that the U.S. and the Biden administration may be over estimating U.S .influence over the EU-Chinese relationship. Let’s take, for example, the case of Germany. Germany is perhaps more dependent on China than even the United States is. Two of Germany’s largest companies, Volkswagen and Siemens, are deeply intertwined with China. Volkswagen, the largest foreign automaker in China, makes cabs, family and luxury cars for users across the country; anyone who has spent time in China knows how deeply VW is embedded in China. Siemens has similar industry-adjusted investment in China. We believe it is unlikely that the world’s most powerful economies are simply going to follow the U.S. in decoupling from China.
To summarize, we believe the United States has played a dangerous game in its negotiations with its largest trading partner and the soon-to-be-largest economy. We believe the Trump Administration was simply dangerous in its brinkmanship negotiations, but we expected more from the Biden Administration. We believed the Biden Administration would be more measured, but we think this current period is not promising. Campbell’s rhetoric of the “end of engagement” and Biden's bellicose rhetoric about “shooting wars” are simply irresponsible. We believe that a return to a diplomatic engagement-oriented policy is the best path forward. We believe the future of the global political economy and global peace depends on this approach.
