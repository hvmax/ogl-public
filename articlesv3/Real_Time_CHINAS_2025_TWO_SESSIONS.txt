On Global Leadership’s regular feature OGL Real Time presents our up-to-the-minute insights on current news and events. We hope these breaking news insights from our OGL team members will help illuminate the events of the day and provide the depth needed to understand global political, economic, and cultural transitions and transformations. In this post, we reflect on the recent 2025 “Two Sessions” Meetings. In 2025, these meetings were held from March 4-11. This Realtime Post summarizes the key issues that emerged from these important, agenda-setting meetings.
The first half of March is China’s Two Sessions period. The National People’s Congress (NPC) and the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) have consistently drawn significant attention from both domestic and international audiences because of their agenda-setting and relative openness. The Two Sessions function as a critical window for observing China’s politics and governance and are widely recognized as the political “weathervane” and economic “barometer” of China.
This year’s Two Sessions focused most attention on China’s GDP growth target of approximately 5% for 2025, aligning with the 2024 goal. This is the third consecutive year China has set its GDP growth target at around 5%, drawing extensive analysis from global observers. In addition to this focus, the government work report highlights other key areas for global politics and economics.
What Two Sessions measures are proposed to address Trump’s tariff war?The most direct response to the latest round of tariffs, which were triggered during the Two Sessions, came from Foreign Minister Wang Yi at his press conference as he answered questions from reporters. Below is the official translation from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs website:
Reuters: Right after Trump returned to the White House, he imposed fresh tariffs on China over fentanyl. But at the same time, he is offering to build a good relationship with China. How differently will China engage with the Trump administration over the next four years compared to his previous term?
Wang Yi: Mutual respect is a basic norm governing state-to-state relations. It is also an important prerequisite for China-U.S. relations. No country should fantasize that it can suppress China and maintain good relations with China at the same time. Such two-faced acts are not good for the stability of bilateral relations, or for building mutual trust.
On fentanyl, it must be made clear at the outset that China always takes resolute measures against drug trafficking and manufacturing, and China has put in place the toughest and most comprehensive counternarcotics policies in today’s world. As early as in 2019, upon the request of the U.S. side, China scheduled all fentanyl-related substances, the first country to do so. But the abuse of fentanyl in the United States is a problem that must be confronted and resolved by the United States itself. China has been assisting the United States in various ways on humanitarian grounds. The United States should not return good with evil or even impose arbitrary tariffs. No responsible major country should do that.
As the Chinese saying goes, “If one’s action fails, look for the reason within oneself.”
The United States should go over what has actually happened: What has it achieved from tariff and trade wars these years? Has its trade deficit widened or narrowed? Has its manufacturing become more competitive or less competitive? Has U.S. inflation gone up or down? Has the life of its people got better or worse?China-U.S. business relations are based on two-way and reciprocal interactions. Cooperation will bring about mutual benefit and win-win, and China will definitely take countermeasures in response to arbitrary pressure.
As the world’s largest developing and developed countries respectively, China and the United States will stay on this planet for a long time. They must therefore seek peaceful coexistence. As President Xi Jinping noted in his telephone call with President Donald J. Trump earlier this year, confrontation and conflict should not be an option. Given the extensive common interests and broad space for cooperation, it is possible for China and the United States to become partners helping each other succeed and prosper together.
China will stay committed to the three principles proposed by President Xi Jinping – mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation – in promoting steady, sound and sustainable development of China-U.S. relations. At the same time, we hope that the U.S. side will listen to the calls of the two peoples, see clearly the trend of the times, take an objective and rational view of China’s development, engage proactively with China in practical exchanges, and work together with China to pursue the right way of getting along with each other to the benefit of the two countries and the whole world.
Wang Yi’s response was measured, embodying Beijing’s consistent stance that rhetoric alone cannot prevail in trade conflicts. At the strategic level, the Two Sessions outlined the following principles and strategic approaches:
Adherence by China to the opening-up policy and free trade principles;Balanced integration of countermeasures and dialogue between the two nations;Expanding domestic demand in China to enhance economic resilience and competitiveness; andStrengthening international collaboration and strategic coordination.
• Adherence by China to the opening-up policy and free trade principles;
• Balanced integration of countermeasures and dialogue between the two nations;
• Expanding domestic demand in China to enhance economic resilience and competitiveness; and
• Strengthening international collaboration and strategic coordination.
Beijing will keep the 2024 economic growth target, aiming to counter external tariff shocks through domestic demand stimulation and structural reforms, supported by fiscal and monetary policies. Targeted policy packages will also be implemented to mitigate trade war impacts on affected industries.
Notably, on March 11, the closing day of the NPC session, Chinese regulatory authorities, including the Ministry of Commerce, held supervisory talks with Walmart. The retail giant was summoned for demanding significant price cuts from Chinese suppliers, an apparent attempt to shift the burden of U.S.-imposed tariffs onto Chinese manufacturers. This intervention is seen as a warning against externalizing tariff costs through supply chain coercion. As noted in previous OGL articles, Walmart is the single-largest exporter from China to the United States, and, given that few, if any, of its products would be eligible for exemptions, it is likely the company that is most deeply affected by the tariffs. Thus, it seems clear that the Chinese government is taking a strong stance on the issue of externalizing tariff costs.
Building on the December 2024 Central Economic Work Conference, theGovernment Work Reportprioritizes, “vigorously boosting consumption and investment returns and stimulating domestic demand across the board” as the foremost government task of 2025. Given the proven effectiveness of fiscal subsidiesfor consumer goods and trade-in programsin boosting domestic demand, what specific measures are planned for this policy in 2025?
Based on the data provided by the National Development and Reform Commission and the Ministry of Commerce (1)(2)(3), in 2024, the central and local governments jointly allocated approximately RMB 170 billion (including RMB 150 billion from the central government) for consumer goods trade-in programs. These drove total sales of related products to exceed 1.3 trillion yuan. Breakdown by sector:
Over 6.8 million vehicles were replaced through the trade-in program, with sales exceeding 920 billion yuan;Sales of home appliances replaced through the trade-in program exceeded 62.76 million units, with sales surpassing 270 billion yuan;Approximately 60 million home decoration, kitchen, and bathroom products received “renewal” subsidies; andOver 1.38 million electric bicycles were replaced through the trade-in program.
• Over 6.8 million vehicles were replaced through the trade-in program, with sales exceeding 920 billion yuan;
• Sales of home appliances replaced through the trade-in program exceeded 62.76 million units, with sales surpassing 270 billion yuan;
• Approximately 60 million home decoration, kitchen, and bathroom products received “renewal” subsidies; and
• Over 1.38 million electric bicycles were replaced through the trade-in program.
The Government Work Report arranged for the issuance of 300 billion yuan in ultra-long-term special treasury bonds for consumer goods trade-in programs, doubling the 2024 allocation. The subsidy coverage will be further expanded to include newly added digital products such as smartphones, tablets, and smart wearable devices.
If central fiscal investments can leverage local government consumption subsidies and household spending at proportions similar to those seen in 2024, trade-in programs are projected to drive total sales of related products to exceed 2.6 trillion yuan in 2025. This amount equates to 360 billion USD, whereas in 2024, China’s exports to the United States amounted to 524.7 billion USD.
What did the Two Sessions propose to address the continuous decline in China’s birth rate?
By the end of 2022, China’s population had decreased by 850,000 from the end of 2021, marking the first annual decline in over six decades. This trend is likely to continue long term. The State Council proposes a policy package of “childcare subsidies + affordable nursery and childcare services + free preschool education,” marking a shift in fertility policies from rhetoric to systematic support. A series of fertility-supporting measures are expected to be implemented soon. However, their effectiveness remains to be seen.
In October 2024, the General Office of the State Council issued the Several Measures on Accelerating the Improvement of Fertility Support Policy Systems and Promoting the Building of a Childbirth-Friendly Society, which includes formulating implementation plans and management regulations for a fertility subsidy system. Echoing this document, the Government Work Report proposes to “formulate policies on boosting birth rates, provide childcare subsidies, vigorously develop integrated nursery and childcare services, and increase public-interest childcare services.”
Dozens of regions in China have introduced childcare subsidy policies, with initial results emerging in areas where implementation has been stronger. Since 2024, Tianmen City in Hubei Province has implemented policies to boost residents’ willingness to have children by distributing childcare subsidies, reducing pregnancy-related costs, ensuring maternity leave benefits, improving housing supply and support, and providing childcare services. In Tianmen, a three-child family can receive subsidies totaling up to 225,100 yuan (4), equivalent to 5.86 times the local urban residents’ per capita disposable income of 38,400 yuan in 2023. As of November 30, 2024, newborns in Tianmen increased by 16% year-on-year, marking the first growth after eight years of decline.
The Two Sessions emphasized the need to “make continued efforts to stem the downturn and restore stability in the real estate market.” Does this mean the previous measures to stabilize the property market and mitigate risks have not yet produced sufficient results?
Listing real estate as the top priority in preventing and defusing risks in key areas, emphasizing the need to “make continued efforts to stem the downturn and restore stability in the real estate market,” not only acknowledged the effectiveness of earlier policies but also signaled that the market still requires further consolidation and deeper adjustments. This reflects both the current complexities of the real estate sector and the necessity of continuing supportive policies.
Since the fourth quarter of 2024, weakness in demand-side conditions has gradually improved under the boost of a new round of property market stimulus policies launched in late September 2024, though the market has shown diverging trends. Activity has slowly rebounded in tier 1 and tier 2 cities such as Shanghai, Shenzhen, and Nanjing etc. However, most tier 3 and tier 4 cities – constrained by high inventory and insufficient demand – remain mired in an adjustment phase.
Meanwhile, operational pressures on real estate developers have yet to be fundamentally alleviated, with residential development investment continuing to contract. Analysis of signals from the Two Sessions suggests that China’s property sector policies will maintain an accommodative stance in 2025. Measures such as urban village redevelopment and land acquisition and reserve programs are expected to further advance the market toward achieving its goal of “stemming the downturn and restoring stability” by 2025.
