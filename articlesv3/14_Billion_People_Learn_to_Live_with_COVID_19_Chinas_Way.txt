### 1.4 Billion People Learn to Live with COVID-19, China's Way

1 September 2021|China, Coronavirus
AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy and, in particular, life in China. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. Our in-depth research often focuses on how China deals with problems, particularly COVID-19, and how it has successfully maneuvered through the pandemic through thorough testing, aggressive tracking, and voluntary changes by the general public. We have written several essays,hereandhere, analyzing China’s progress in dealing with the pandemic over the 18 months, and this post is thesecond partof our recent work examining the current rise of the Delta variant. – The Editorial Team.

As the vaccination rates increased, some countries took it as a moment of respite from the ever increasing COVID-19 cases that caused spikes over the past year. Along with this moment to take a break a public conversation arose about what was next. Thus the phrase “learning to live with the virus” was repeatedly relayed from various international platforms around the world.
China is not immune from this discussion. For two months in 2020, the China's government took the extreme decision to stop China in its tracks. All 1.4 billion people went through a crash course in pandemic management. The key take-aways are the three TO Dos: Wear a mask, maintain social distance, and wash hands.
Social distancing has become a fine art. As one steps into an elevator or a full metro car, one scans the faces. Who is wearing a mask? Who is standing too close? There is an automatic reaction and a rush to find a strategically safe space. Once every case in Wuhan was tracked down, as well as every case throughout the country, the country cautiously reopened, in stages, over time. The very last stage was to bring children back to classrooms in the late spring of 2020.
One year later, the country maintains vigilance as COVID-19 outbreaks continue to occur across the country. COVID-19  jumps the boundaries created around airports where cases are imported on a daily basis by Chinese returning home infected with COVID-19  or through freight infected at origin. The risk is compounded when airport staff do not follow protocols. For example, in the most recent case, airport cleaning crews at Nanjing Lukou International Airport became infected while cleaning the airplane cabin in which there had been a positive case on a flight from Russia on July 10. Unfortunately, the infected staff were not discovered until one week later through testing. That delay resulted in over 800 infections spread over nine provinces and 173 locations several weeks later. The emergency epidemic management system jumped into action with lockdowns, never ending testing, and mobility control mechanisms. The testing continues until no local cases are found. The area returns to equilibrium, and the pressure is visibly lessened.
With the Delta variant spreading through China, the recent outbreak has been felt far and wide. There has been a short-lived public discussion about what “living with COVID” means. In China, a public debate between two experts is unusual.
Dr. Zhang Wenhong, an expert in epidemiology based in Shanghai at Huashan Hospital, has made a name for himself since the beginning of the pandemic with his calm professional demeanor. So, his comments on Weibo would naturally catch people’s attention. His matter of fact comment that if there are no active cases in China there must be something wrong. COVID-19 cannot be eliminated. There should be a case somewhere.
Gao Qiang, a retired former Chinese health minister refuted that, focusing on the Central government’s policy to eradicate the virus, with “zero-COVID” as a goal. Mr. Gao and those who share that opinion see a “live with it” mentality as a ruse by the international community to drag China into the health care and economic mess that exists in the majority of other countries. Accepting this attitude is seen as a complete failure by Western governments to  model real leadership and protect their people.
The debate between these two respected experts was picked up by netizens across the Chinese web. They reformed the questions, translating the meaning into their own words. Suddenly, there were news reports of questions about the originality of Dr. Zhang’s PhD thesis, which he wrote over 20 years ago.
What was that about? The peak was reached with news that a teacher in Jiangxi province said living with COVID-19 on a daily basis was acceptable on social media. He framed his opinion as a question. He was detained and held for 15 days for proposing this question in the media. A chill came over the Weibo world and the public debate was promptly stopped.
As Deng Xiaoping explained how to drive forward change, “It was my idea to discourage contention, so we have more time for action. Once disputes begin, they complicate matters and waste a lot of time. As a result, nothing is accomplished.” And in the words of the immortal Nike, “just do it.”
Every time an outbreak occurs in China the goal is to bring the situation to zero cases. No leader of a country with over a billion people would possibly allow the pandemic to run rampant. There would not be enough hospital beds to handle the onslaught. The impact to economic livelihood in China would be near impossible to recover from in the near to medium term.
Does anyone really believe that Dr. Zhang meant for the emergency epidemic measures to be abandoned? The automatic management response to each outbreak, which citizens have come to expect, are the result of many months experimenting over the course of 2020. It’s obvious that this method saves lives and protects economic livelihoods. Indeed, it's more humane in the longterm than the other option modeled in other countries.
No, the epidemic management measures must remain in place. The constant reminders that we are fighting an unseen enemy -- signs in public places, temporary tables at entrances to buildings manned by face-masked or hazmat-suited staff, infrared temperature stations, and public service announcements to cooperate -- are important to keep the general population alert. By maintaining a low flame when there are no active cases, the government is able to raise the heat to respond to infections. And if one finds oneself in the unfortunate situation of a residential compound locked down, don’t lose heart. Good communication and a swift response usually means the situation will return to a normal balanced state within a few incubation rounds.
Each country must find its own path to what "living with COVID” means. China and the Chinese people have found theirs in a daily management mentality, flexing as needed with sitings of the Delta variant. It's not political. It’s a way of life. It’s a mindset. Let’s just get on with it.
