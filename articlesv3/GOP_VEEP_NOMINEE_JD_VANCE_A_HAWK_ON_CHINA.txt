On Global Leadership’s regular feature OGL Real Time presents our up-to-the-minute insights on current news and events. We hope these breaking news insights from our OGL team members will help illuminate the events of the day and provide the depth needed to understand global political, economic, and cultural transitions and transformations. In this post, we consider Republican Vice Presidential Candidate J.D. Vance’s views on China.
How did U.S. Sen. J.D. Vance become the Republican nominee for vice president?
On July 15, 2024, former President Trump announced his selection of Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance as his vice presidential running mate. While his name had been one among many, there was some surprise that the senator, with only two years of government experience, was selected to fill such a critical role.

There are many ways the world is analyzing the “fit” between Trump and Vance. We will largely focus our analysis on Vance's views on China and what his potential election might mean for U.S.-China relations.
We must raise one note of caution in examining his record. It is difficult to assess what Vance’s views on China – or any issue – actually are, as it seems those views are flexible enough to fit any situation -- or can be tailored to align with whatever presidential candidate who might seek to put him on the ticket.
After all, during the 2016 campaign, Vance was on the record calling Donald Trump an “idiot" and “Hitler,” and also announced he was a “Never Trump Guy" because Trump was “leading the American working class to a very dark place." He even risked the disfavor of the GOP brethren saying “I might have to hold my nose and vote for Hillary Clinton”, in a 2016 interview with NPR’s Terry Gross.
Vance’s antipathy for Trump disappeared in 2022 when he was running for Ohio's U.S. Senate seat, realizing his chances of winning the contest were better if Trump was fighting in his corner. Since that time, Vance has worked hard to ingratiate himself with Trump and his MAGA followers, often being the first person to criticize his opponents or pay fealty to Trump on various issues in order to curry favor with the former president.
What is Vance's back story?
An Ohio native, Vance served in the United States Marine Corps, attended Ohio State University, and Yale Law School, where he served as editor of theYale Law Journal, and graduated with a J.D. in 2013.

Shortly after graduating from Yale, Vance began work on his memoir,Hillbilly Elegy: A Memoir of a Family and Culture in Crisis, which was published in 2016 by Harper. The book draws on his personal experiences as a child in Middletown, Ohio, and the summers he spent in Appalachia with his grandmother, who lived in poverty.
The memoir tapped into a vein of discontent among working class Americans, and it became a popular read for liberals. It quickly became a national bestseller and was made into a movie, directed by Ron Howard and released in 2020. Between writing and elective office, Vance spent six years working as a corporate lawyer and a venture capitalist. He parlayed those connections into a great platform to run for the Senate, and he was sworn into office in January 2023.
Vance has already captured the imagination of people in China. The Chinese translation of Hillbilly Elegy was published in 2017 and is now sold out. On Taobao, a used copy of the book is now selling for around $55.

Is Vance an economic nationalist and how might that shape his views on foreign policy and global trade?
First, Vance is without question an “economic nationalist,” an ideology where a nation’s economic interests are always placed first. This is not a new view. Indeed, in an interview with Micah Meadowcroft ofThe American Conservative, Vance explained, “I voted for Mitt Romney, but I didn't really think that his foreign policy was sort of the main thing that drew me to his platform. He was actually pretty good on China in his 2012 campaign… You know, there were elements of Trumpist economic nationalism in Romney’s 2012 campaign that I really, to this day, admire.”
What exactly does economic nationalism mean in this context? Economic nationalism is an interesting turn for the Republican Party, the Party that championed free markets and Neoclassical Economic Theory under President Reagan and his Economic Advisor, Milton Friedman. Thus, in this era, economic nationalism means curtailing trade, significantly scaling back on importing and exporting, and becoming self-reliant as a nation by building the local economy. In the case of the United States, the view was: support American jobs and, by extension, the American economy, by buying goods that were made in America.
Early on, Vance has seemed a fervent critic of China and its policies. What's your take on his positions?
Vance seems happy to vilify manufacturing competitors, like China, rather than facing up to the fact that the gutting of manufacturing supply chains in American was a decision of the US government (mainly, the Republican Party) and US corporations. It is the United States, under the leadership of  Reagan and Friedman, that allowed, even encouraged, corporations to pursue profits by seeking cheap labor and building manufacturing supply chains abroad.

Welcoming these corporations was not China’s crime (China did not “steal” U.S. jobs as Vance claims); rather it was the choice of corporate elites and their shareholders. Yet, Vance still wants to superficially cite issues of “slave” labor, which has long since been abolished in China’s manufacturing supply chains. Says Vance: “If you apply tariffs, really what it is you're saying [is] that we're going to penalize you for using slave labor in China and importing that stuff in the United States. What you end up doing is, you end up making more stuff in America, in Pennsylvania, in Ohio and in Michigan” (Voice of America (VOA), July 16, 2024).
In the VOA interview, Vance was also asked about the war in Ukraine, and he quickly deflected and changed the subject to China, saying, the United States needs to “bring this thing to a rapid close so America can focus on the real issue, which is China… That’s the biggest threat to our country and we are completely distracted from it.”
As he said in a Heritage Foundation Leadership Summit speech, the United States needs to focus on China, because “that’s where the real enemy is.” Despite the vilification of China, it is clear that the world’s second largest economy would be a significant focus of the U.S. foreign economic policy under a Trump-Vance Administration.
On the third night of the Republican National Convention (July 17), Vance accepted the nomination and used his speech to take a crack at China. He noted: "When I was a sophomore in high school, .... [a] career politician named Joe Biden gave China a sweetheart trade deal that destroyed even more good American middle-class manufacturing jobs." Vance was referring to the U.S.-China Relations Act of 2000. He also blamed China for the fentanyl crisis in the U.S. in his convention speech.
At OGL, we wish this focus would be economic cooperation and engagement between the world’s two largest economies, but a Trump-Vance Administration would likely be much more focused on competition.
Beyond economics, has Vance got other concerns related to China?
Vance has been an outspoken advocate of AUKUS, the trilateral nuclear security partnership for the Indo-Pacific, bringing together Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States to softly govern the region. It is not hard to imagine how the exclusion of China and India, the region’s two largest countries (and the world’s two largest populations), might rub these countries the wrong way. But to be clear, the point here is that Vance is supportive of geopolitical alliances that clearly seek to contain China. At OGL, we believe that engagement and partnership is a much better path than containment and heading toward to a new Cold War.
Does Vance have an opinion on the Taiwan question?
Finally, it is important to address Taiwan. While Vance seems to imply a position of supporting Taiwan independence, saying things like, the Ukraine war was “inviting Chinese aggression because they know we don’t have the weapon systems to support both Ukraine and Taiwan” (SCMP, 7.16.24).
However, as we have reported previously, we believe that smart, self-interested, economically oriented politicians are going to quickly see just how devastating it would be if China suddenly decided to shut the doors on key global corporations, like Apple, Tesla, GM, and Walmart (seehere). There is just no way the United States wins a trade war with China, and we hope Vance will see this if he and Trump win the election this year.
As we have been saying in much of our research and writing over the years: engagement, engagement, engagement. Economic engagement and partnership are the only ways forward.
