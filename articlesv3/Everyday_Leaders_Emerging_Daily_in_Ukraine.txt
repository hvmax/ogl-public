AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy. Several of us have advised companies and taught about leadership over theyears, and we have developed atheoryof leadership that takes us away from the charismatic leader to the person on the ground fighting for theteam, community,family, or evenyoung adolescent leaders. We have also written a significant amount aboutsystems leadershipandcreative leadership. In this post, we seek to continue our advancement of a view of Everyday Leadership as it is being applied today in war-torn Ukraine. – The Editorial Team

What is happening in Ukraine has captured our attention for all the same reasons that it has yours: the bravery of its citizens, the patriotic fighting to protect one’s homeland, and the fear that a free people could fall victim to the whims of an unconscionable neighbor that cares little about the cost.
We are not surprised by the number of Ukrainians who have stepped up to fight against Russia. A patriotism that runs deep into the soil there has fueled the resistance and the passion to protect their nation from an invading and deadly force. As bombs fall, and tanks roll through towns, citizens remain defiant.
For those of us who believe in the power of Everyday Leadership, the singular acts of resistance, from protesting in the streets to taking up arms in the field to making Molotov cocktails in basements and garages are individual acts of leadership in the face of the unthinkable.
Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has proven to be a smart, valiant, and charismatic leader of the highest order. He is a wartime president who has inspired in his people a fierce refusal to accept what seems to be the inevitable: the collapse of Ukraine against an overwhelming, better-armed enemy.
When he was elected, Zelenskyy was dismissed – and belittled by some – for his curious pre-political career as an actor and comedian. Those critiques have proved short-sighted. In the first few weeks, Zelenskyy has rejected a compromising Realpolitik and instead used his humanity and conscience to arouse a nation and the world. His citizens have taken up that call and are responding as the individual leaders that wars demand, especially immoral wars.
This moment calls to mind some of the writings of philosopher, author, and Holocaust survivor Viktor E. Frankl, who understood what can happen to people in war. “We who lived in concentration camps can remember the men who walked through the huts comforting others, giving away their last piece of bread. They may have been few in number, but they offer sufficient proof that everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms -- to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one's own way,” said Frankl.
Daily, we receive media reports of people who are responding heroically inside Ukraine and along its borders. Individuals offering comfort, feeding neighbors in their kitchens, setting up makeshift hospitals to care for injured soldiers and civilians, and spiriting refugees away to other countries. And the battlefield is not filled with solders alone. Citizens are arming themselves and policing their own streets and fields and playgrounds.
As Frankl noted, “Forces beyond your control can take away everything you possess except one thing, your freedom to choose how you will respond to the situation.”
Everyday leaders are being born by the thousands on the battlefields, in the streets, and inside schools and homes in Ukraine. And daily, they are choosing how to respond to "their situation."
