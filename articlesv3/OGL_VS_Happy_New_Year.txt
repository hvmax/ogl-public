### OGL VS: Happy New Year!

29 January 2025|Chinese Culture, OGL Versus
AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy and, in particular, life in China. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. We have sought to advance a conversation about the U.S.-China relationship, and a deep understanding of local economic development in China. OGL Versus, our latest feature, allows us to write briefly about the interesting competition between the U.S. and China, and offer some additional readings to take this conversation to even deeper levels. In our latest post, we briefly discuss the differences between the Chinese and U.S. New Year celebrations.
New Year's in the United States arrives with a champagne-fueled countdown, a glittering ball drop, and the collective optimism of hastily made resolutions that—let’s be honest—won’t survive February. It’s a celebration of reinvention, a crisp, clean slate where everyone vows to exercise more, spend less, and be generally better people.
China, on the other hand, doesn’t just flip the calendar page. Chinese New Year is a 15-day extravaganza of food, family, and firecrackers, rooted in centuries-old traditions that make January 1st look like a warm-up act. It follows the lunar calendar, proving that patience is a virtue—after all, good things come to those who wait. Instead of promising personal transformation, the Chinese welcome luck, prosperity, and happiness with red envelopes (cash over crash diets, anyone?), dragon dances, and dumplings shaped like ancient ingots.
These celebrations reveal deep cultural truths: America is obsessed with self-improvement, always sprinting toward an idealized future, while China values continuity, honoring the past while ensuring fortune for the next generation. One is an ode to individual ambition, the other to collective harmony. And while both have fireworks, only one has the wisdom to stretch the party out for two whole weeks.
As the Chinese New Year begins, we thought we'd share some facts about the two new year celebrations, revealing the differences in culture and customs:
Chinese New Year:Follows the lunar calendar, usually falling between January 21 and February 20 depending on the new moon. It runs 15 days long, concluding with the Lantern Festival. A major national holiday in China and other East Asian countries, with a week or more of official time off.U.S. New Year:Based on the Gregorian calendar, celebrated on January 1st every year. It is primarily a one-day celebration (New Year's Eve into New Year's Day), although many have stretched it beyond that. January 1st is a public holiday, but work resumes quickly afterward.

While the Chinese New Year is a deeply cultural and familial holiday spanning two weeks and marked by ancient traditions, and the U.S. New Year is a modern, festive celebration focused on parties, resolutions, and turning over a new leaf, they ultimately focus on closing out the old year and beginning a new one.
