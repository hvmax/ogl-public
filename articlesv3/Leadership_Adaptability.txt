The Levers of Adaptability Series: Part 1: Strategy & Planning
Over the next several months,On Global Leadershipwill be publishing a six-part series of articles on the topic of organizational and leadership adaptability. Previous posts on leadershiphave developed Sensemaking, Solutionmaking andSelfmakingas “dynamic capabilities” of teams and organizations driven and shaped by systems thinking. Here, Mohammad Z. Iqbal explores the complexity of organizational leadership through the lens of adaptability. Part 1 discusses how organizations can use their strategy as an enabler of organizational adaptability. —The OGL Editors

An organization’s strategy defines its path forward. As the strategy touches every aspect of what the organization is and what it does – from the organization’s goals and targets to its customers, products, and services to the internal capabilities it employs to deliver those products and services – it is not a surprise that how an organization develops and maintains its strategy directly and comprehensively impacts that organization’s ability to be adaptable to changing circumstances
The State of Strategy
The robustness of organizational strategies and the confidence executives attach to their own strategy development processes are a good indicator of how effective these strategies will be in allowing leaders and organizations to adapt and respond to unplanned events. Recent industry surveys continue to show general weaknesses in how organizations develop and implement strategies. An ongoing survey being conducted by PwC’sStrategy& indicates that only 37% of respondents are confident about the relevance of their company’s value proposition or that their company has a well-defined strategy, and only 20% of the surveyed companies are clear on what capabilities are important to winning[1].
Business and organizational strategy has always been about moving forward. It has reflected a singular focus on growth and competition mostly articulated through quantity instead of quality of growth. For motivational purposes, strategy practitioners have often borrowed aggressive concepts and terminology from the military. It is no surprise then that strategy has come to represent group thinking and singular perspectives within organizations, preferring optimistic over pessimistic views and rejecting options and opinions that do not fit within narrowly defined strategic visions and missions.
Historically, the market for ideas and intellectual capital related to strategic planning and the associated potential for consulting services led to an explosion of frameworks and models (Figure 1). This often shifted leadership and organizational focus from critical and unstructured thinking needed to assess and develop resilient and adaptable strategies to enforcing use of specific frameworks. As a result, this framework-driven strategy development has often taken away the flexibility and diversity of solutions needed to make strategies more robust to change.
In summary, both the aggressive and exclusively forward-looking concept of strategic planning and the inappropriate use of frameworks has often led to development of overly definitive strategic positions devoid of considering perspectives that may seem less positive or weak. Many organizations continue to believe that the purpose of strategic planning is to providethesolution – a single, defined, and actionable path that will deliver competitive advantage and financial benefits.
Handling Uncertainty in Strategic Planning
It is a well-established fact that our ability to accurately predict future events and potential risks is very limited. While we can use past trends and extrapolate them to a few months ahead to guess what the near term may hold, our ability to extrapolate and guess beyond more than 6 months or a year is highly questionable. Businesses and organizations, however, do need to develop insights about the future to plan, budget, and implement initiatives. When the future is vague, it makes sense to develop a high-level understanding of market conditions or the geopolitical environment, but attempting to provide too much specificity to what actions you may need to take in the future is not only a waste of time but is also likely to adversely impact your ability to respond effectively to any changes in the environment. Through specific actions companies and leaders commit resources and put their reputations on the line, and it is often hard to back down from those choices when adaptability to a change requires us to do so.
Organizational strategic plans have often ignored this inability to predict future risks and events. Increasing availability and use of data sometimes magnifies this problem by helping people see trends that actually don’t exist or giving them false confidence about their ability to extrapolate and predict the future. Terms like long-term and medium-term strategic plans are reflective of this misplaced confidence, and it is very common for organizations to develop highly specific strategic initiatives more than a year into the future.
What organizations need for adaptability is a careful strategic planning process that provides both the specificity for the near short-term, using strategic priorities and initiatives, but also high-level insights regarding the medium- and long-term through use of strategic foresight[2](Figure 2). These medium- and long-term insights can be routinely monitored and turned into specific actions with time or if conditions change and the organization needs to adapt. While it is critical for organizations to assess and plan responses to conditions that may occur more than 18 months in the future, any attempts to give these assessments perceived validity by documenting them in the official organizational strategy is incorrect. The actual timeline shown in Figure 2 can be adjusted somewhat based on industry characteristics, but in most cases it will be relevant as shown.
In the last two decades, concepts adopted from the study of Complex Adaptive Systems have contributed the most to the field of strategic planning in terms of making organizational strategies more adaptable to changes. In his 2006 book,The Origin of Wealth, Eric Beinhocker[3]discussed the fact that “the economy is too complex, too non-linear, too dynamic, and too sensitive to the twists and turns of chance to be amenable to prediction over anything but the very shortest of terms.” He introduced the concept of strategy as a portfolio of experiments to counter the unpredictability inherent in our economic and business systems.
This approach focusing on maintaining a portfolio of experiments to define an organization’s strategy is a useful concept and can be further developed to improve our understanding of how leaders and organizations can develop strategies that are focused and adaptable at the same time.
A model to understand how adaptable strategies can be developed, tested, and implemented is shown in Figure 3.
An organization defines what it hopes to accomplish (its objectives), uses appropriate frameworks to assess internal factors relating to its organizational capacity and capability along with external factors relating to the economy and competition, and identifies a portfolio of strategic alternatives that, over time, are tested and implemented to varying degrees depending on their performance and pre-established exit criteria.
Once a strategic alternative has been identified, it may remain inactive until certain events trigger its activation providing the organization the ability to quickly respond to unplanned events. Each strategic alternative reflects diversity of product or service areas or may reflect the diversity within each product/service area (for example, multiple design and competitive options related to a specific service offering). In this model, the various frameworks are not used to define the strategic positioning of an organization. Instead, they only support the overall process providing ways to assess the internal and external factors impacting an organizations choice of strategic alternatives.
This approach moves leaders and their organizations away from narrow and definitive strategic paths often reinforced through the motivational and vague guidance provided through organizational visions and mission statements. Unlike the narrowly defined strategic path developed through use of frameworks, the model presented in Figure 3 provides the strategic breadth needed for leadership and organizational adaptability, while at the same time using testing and exploration to ensure that only the most robust strategic choices make it to full scale implementation.
The important point to note in Figure 3 is that an organization still needs some boundary conditions to guide its identification of the strategic portfolio, otherwise it faces the risk of a lack of strategic focus leading to inefficiencies in investments and execution. At the same time, during times of change or in the face of unplanned events every organization and leader needs a core that provides the solid and stable foundation needed to respond to changes. Otherwise, leaders run the risk of overreacting to unplanned events (a typical problem, as discussed by Collins and Hansen[4]), or without the proper rigor needed to develop an effective response. These boundary conditions and the core is a set of strategic principles establish by leaders.
The strategic principles are not vague statements like the vision or mission. Instead, the principles set some strategic rules around what an organization can (and cannot) do, providing the needed discipline to guide forward growth but also providing a support point for the organization to retreat to during times of unplanned and adverse changes. A great example of strategic principles is the list of 10 points Southwest Airline’s CEO, Howard Putnam laid out in 1979 (Figure 4) to provide strategic direction for the airline. As strategic principles, these points set long-term boundary conditions for Southwest’s growth and provided a core that the airline could rely on to test new ideas against.
Planning Your Success . . . and Your Failure
Most business literature (and associated solutions) on responding to unexpected events and crises looks at how leaders and organizations react and respond once a negative event has occurred. Typical advice provides tools to assess the event once it has already happened, promoting such leadership traits as calmness, quick response, and effective communications. While it is noble to stay positive and attempt to keep your workforce motivated through aggressive and optimistic communications or posturing, major unplanned events do occur derailing plans and growth projections of organizations. The test of a leader’s adaptability is his or her ability to regroup and provide clarity on what happens next.
When unanticipated and unplanned events occur, leaders need to often retreat from their existing and traditional positions to regroup and counter any negative impacts of change. Unfortunately, unlike the military, business schools and the various strategy frameworks don’t teach how to retreat well when needed.
Most companies can readily describe their path forward (through their Forward Strategy), but very few have thought about a plan of action for the way down or back (a Retreat Strategy). Even when companies do take the time to conduct war games and scenario planning, the focus is on how to quickly counter risks and challenges to maintain the upside and the positive aspects of growth.
Adaptable behavior requires that leaders and organizations assess their strategies, and for each option, assess and chart out retreat scenarios if unexpected negative events do occur. This requires careful assessment of the options available in case a retreat from current positions is needed, including diverse factors like considering the supply chain, reallocating manufacturing capacity, implementing new pricing models, or having specific public relations actions in place to counter impacts of negative events[5]. Notionally, the various options needed to respond to unplanned events are well known to business leaders, but very few have actually worked through them to map out and test retreat options to respond to each specific event leaving organizations and leaders struggling to cope with uncertainty and change.
The process needed to develop a Retreat Strategy would be similar to a company planning its Forward Strategy, considering options in case of an unanticipated positive event. For example, in response to a sudden and major jump in demand for one of its existing products, a company would require plans for ramping up of manufacturing and distribution capacity. Adaptable leaders do not wait until the positive event has already happened but plan out the different scenarios in advance providing them the leverage to outpace their competition. Similarly, an adaptable leader would also work out a planned response to a sudden drop in demand by mapping out, testing, and optimizing a Retreat Strategy.
It is true that the exact nature and timing of an unplanned event is nearly impossible to predict. However, as will be discussed in Part 2 of this series (Risk Management), focusing on likely effects of an unplanned event instead of its timing can help leaders successfully plan out the specific impacts in their Retreat Strategies.
