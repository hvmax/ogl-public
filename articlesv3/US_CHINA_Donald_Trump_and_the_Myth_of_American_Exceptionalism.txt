In a global pandemic and crisis such as the one we are currently experiencing, there is plenty of blame to go around. Recently, I listened to a Freakonomics Podcast, which featured guests Michelle Flournoy and Michael Auslin. I was surprised and troubled by some of the comments and sentiments. OurOn Global Leadershipteam has been hanging around the China scholarly community for more than three decades now, so we have come in contact with pundits like Flournoy and Auslin over the years. Ms. Flournoy’s views were not that extreme – she refers to herself as a “pragmatist” – and her views seem to reflect the realistic approaches to engagement with China that emerged under the Clinton administration and were continued under the Bush and Obama administrations (she served as Undersecretary of Defense for Policy in the Obama administration).
Professor Auslin is a different story. He has a long history of anti-China rhetoric, and his Freakonomics podcast did not disappoint. At one point early in the conversation, Mr. Auslin attempted to clarify his anti-China position, saying, “I’m not a China hawk, I’m a CCP hawk.” (I guess I understand the distinction and an analogous statement might be: ‘I’m not anti-American, I just hate the US government,’ which one can imagine, given the US government’s track record with policies that have inflicted suffering on some parts of the world.) In any case, following his self-identification as a hawk, Professor Auslin spent most of the interview talking about all China had done wrong in its handling of the coronavirus pandemic. (To be clear, this is not Auslin’s first statement along these lines. Indeed, in theNational Review, Auslin wrote that, “the CCP, which for years has claimed to be a responsible member of the global community, showed its true colors when this crisis hit. It can no longer be denied that Xi’s regime is a danger to the world. Justice demands it be held morally culpable for its dangerous and callous behavior.”)
As China scholars, we would argue for a little more nuance. Given that the CCP has been the governing body of China for over 70 years, statements like those of Professor Auslin are disappointing in their lack of depth. The CCP under Mao was a horrific totalitarian system; under the leadership of President Jiang Zemin and Premier Zhu Rongji (our favorite Chinese leader of the Reform Era), it was a much more hopeful place; Hu Jintao and Wen Jiabao were much more laissez-fair in their governance, though there was also a significant rise in corruption in that period. Under Xi Jinping, we have returned to a much more authoritarian system. It is also a system that has lifted 500 million people out of poverty over the last 40 years and reduced mortality rates below that of the world’s richest nation, the United States.
Further, there is a long cultural history in China ofnotescalating issues. For example, one common Chinese saying exhorts local leaders to minimize major problems and make minor issues disappear (大事化小, 小事化了). This sentiment has a deep history in China (preceding the CCP) and may come out of either Confucianism or perhaps Buddhism. It has long been a Chinese way of governing through harmony and only escalating to the center in extreme circumstances. (A similar sentiment might be captured in the famous phrase “the mountains are high and the emperor is far away” 山高皇帝远.) The art is to know when to escalate.
In the Wuhan case China's leaders failed to understand what they were dealing with and their limitations in dealing with it. Then they suppressed the voices and reverted to a localized political control. By the time the Central Government understood how serious things were, it was too late. We are not here to argue that China made no mistakes in its handling of the pandemic. It did. It does seem odd to us, however, to vociferously lambaste China for all the CCP has done wrong with respect to this awful pandemic while seeming to imply that all that is happening in the US, which is leading the world in COVID-19 cases, is somehow China’s fault.
At this particular moment, it seems to us that the United States under President Donald Trump’s leadership has ceded some moral high ground. Here are a couple of areas where the comparison between the leaders of the two countries might be uncomfortable, particularly for the president of the world’s most powerful democratic polity.
Honest Leadership
One of the common characterizations of authoritarian leaders is the level of dishonesty they will pursue in order to protect their own positions of power. As one writer inThe Guardianrecently argued, “it is clear that the virus of Xi’s totalitarian rule threatens the health and freedoms not only of the Chinese people, but of all of us everywhere. Xi’s vacuous, self-aggrandizing ideological vision lies at the heart of this global crisis.” Again, we are not attempting here to defend mistakes that have been made by China or any other country, but we would ask this: has Trump been any better than Xi? Vacuous? Just listen to Trump’s coronavirus media briefings. Self-aggrandizing? This is a president who recently said (as reported by MSNBC), “I have built the most powerful economy in human history.” No kidding, direct quote, he actually said that. (As an ironic aside, I know Trump is not a big reader, but he should study history a little bit, as I think the Ming Emperors, who oversaw an economy that was 1/3 of the global GDP, might quibble with this characterization.)
Final point on Trump and honesty: this is a president who lies on a regular basis. According toThe Washington Post, Trump has made more than 18,000 false or misleading statements so far in his presidency. Many leaders make false or misleading statements, but the United States under the leadership of Donald Trump doesnotown the moral high ground in the honesty realm.
Critics of authoritarian societies often rightly point to a lack of transparency in reporting statistics. Fair enough. And, indeed, China has a long history of manipulating and hiding data, and sometimes this habit has had catastrophic consequences, as in the Great Leap Forward of 1959-62. But in the current pandemic, we have seen that the US government under Trump's leadership is not spotless in this area, either. As reported by Mary Beth Griggs in Vox Media’sThe Verge(based on original reporting by journalist Judd Legum), the CDC changed its COVID-19 test reporting in early March when it became clear that the United States’ progress was moving abysmally slow. On March 1, the Centers for Disease Control's (CDC) website reported that the US had conducted 472 tests total (at a time when South Korea was conducting 10,000 testsper day); a day later, after some media outlets began to point to the US’s slow movement in testing, the CDC stopped reporting test numbers. Apparently, someone higher up did not like the glacial progress on rolling out US tests or how it made the US government look. So just delete it. In a similar move, as reported by CNN, the National Stockpile Website was changed a day after it was pointed out that the language of the website contradicted Jared Kushner's characterization of the National Stockpile. Governmental language contradicts a vacuous White House "Senior" advisor? No problem, just change it. Sorry, no moral high ground on the transparency front either. Now, one might argue that the very fact that this lack of transparencywasreported by Legum and Griggs and CNN is an argument for the strength of American institutions, such as a free press, and that is true. However, our focus in this article is the leadership of Donald Trump and the lack of transparency of his administration.
Shutting Down Dissent
One of the frightening things about authoritarian governments is how they deal with dissent. In China, the fateful and unfortunate moves by Wuhan authorities against the heroic Dr. Li and Dr. Ai in the early days of the pandemic have been publicized globally. It is tragic that a government would shut down dissent, especially among experts and when lives are at risk. But what of the US government’s treatment of Dr. Rick Bright, the former head of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority? Dr. Bright has filed a whistleblower claim, charging he was retaliated against because he would not fall in line with the cronyism of the Trump administration. “I am speaking out because to combat this deadly virus, science – not politics or cronyism – has to lead the way…,” Dr. Bright told CNN, noting that “clashes with political leadership” as a reason for his demotion. His resistance to “efforts to fund potentially dangerous drugs promoted by those with political connections” accounted for his ouster, he said. Here again, difficult to see how the US owns any moral high ground. One might point to the fact that the US system has institutions thatprotectwhistle-blowers, and no one will be “disappeared” for extended periods of time for speaking out. However, in the era of Trump’s leadership, we worry about the shutting down of any dissent.
All of this tit for tat and finger pointing at dismal leadership recently came to a head. On April 27, Trump announced that US agencies were investigating China’s handling of the disease, and the US government would most likely seek “very substantial” damages from China over the pandemic. “We are not happy with China,” Trump said. “We believe it could have been stopped at the source. It could have been stopped quickly and it wouldn’t have spread all over the world.” Again, China surely made mistakes and was less than transparent, but Trump cannot blame China for the fact that the US nowleads the worldin both COVID-19 cases and deaths. Sorry, Donald, you can’t pass the buck here.
When the story of this pandemic is finally written, Trump and Xi will have more in common than an affinity for authoritarian rule. Both leaders sought to repress the bad news of the outbreak; they both tried to dismiss medical officials who alerted them to the health threat. They were slow to announce restrictions on movement, allowing the virus to spread throughout their populations. Both men pushed responsibility down to local authorities to mitigate and resolve the thorny questions about quarantines and virus containment. By choosing to “politicize” the pandemic rather than approach it with the transparency required for a public health catastrophe, they endangered the lives of their own people and upended the economies of their countries.
If we’re comparing the sheer magnitude of their failures, some in the west might argue that the authoritarian Xi is the more significant culprit. His secretive leadership may have set the stage for a global pandemic. But that shouldn’t result in Trump being given a free pass. Moments of deep crisis require honest, transparent, and accountable leadership. Trump’s sorry leadership has been a factor in the virus spreading across the United States and the deaths that followed in its lethal wake. What’s so exceptional about that?
