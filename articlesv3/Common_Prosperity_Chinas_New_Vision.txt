AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy and, in particular, life in China. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. We have sought to advance a conversation about the U.S.-China relationship, and a deep understanding of local economic development in China. We have written a series about the strategic strength oflocal economic development in China’s 2nd and 3rd tier citiesandentrepreneurship in China today. We have written aboutinnovation in the Chinese economyandeconomic developmentas it relates tosocial inequality. This post adds to that conversation. – The Editorial Team

The challenges of economic inequality are faced by all societies across the globe. The solution China is pursuing in its program of Common Prosperity (共同富裕) is an important step for the world’s most populous nation (and second largest economy). In this article, we offer a nuanced and historically grounded window into what is actually behind this new movement.
China’s economic development has not narrowed the widening gap between the rich and the poor in the country. The Gini Coefficient of Chinese Residents’ Disposable Income has long been above 0.4, indicating the level of income inequality exceeds that of most Western countries (though not the United States,as we have previously written).
After “letting some people get rich first,” income inequality and wealth polarization are not only a phenomena Chinese people are concerned about, but inequality may indeed be a significant obstacle for the country’s further development. Since 2021, Common Prosperity has replaced Moderate Prosperity (1) to become China’s new vision for the next 30 years. How does Chinese society view Common Prosperity? How big is the gap between the rich and the poor in China? How will China achieve Common Prosperity? This article will answer these questions.
What is Common Prosperity?
Common Prosperity literally means "Getting rich together," combining the words “common” (共同 gongtong) and "rich" (富裕 fuyu). Although talking about Common Prosperity is easy, to define it clearly is not. How much wealth is wealthy, how do we judge the concept of “common,” etc.?
The Central Committee for Financial and Economic Affairs of China (2) described Common Prosperity at its 10th meeting on August 17, 2021, in the following way: It is the affluence shared by everyone, both in material and spiritual terms; it is not the prosperity of a few people; nor is it uniform egalitarianism.
According to the Party’s aspirations and plans, Common Prosperity will be realized in two stages:
The First Stage, 2020 to 2035: People are leading more comfortable lives, and the size of the middle-income group has grown considerably. Disparities in urban-rural development, in development between regions, and in living standards are significantly reduced; equitable access to basic public services is basically ensured; and solid progress has been made toward prosperity for everyone. (3)
The Second Stage, 2035 to the Middle of the 21st Century: Common Prosperity for everyone is basically achieved, the Chinese people will live happier, safer and healthier lives. (3)
The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) usually expresses its long-term goals in a qualitative way, so does Common Prosperity. So far there is only a vague description: Reach current high-income national standard by the end of the "14th Five-Year Plan" (2025), and double the total economic output or per capita income by 2035.
According to data from the World Bank, China's per capita GNI in 2020 was $10,610, and the standard for high-income countries is $12,696 (4). To achieve the above goals, China's per capita GDP growth must reach 4-5% excluding the exchange-rate factor. As China is already the world's second largest economy, an average annual growth rate of 4-5% is an  aggressive goal.
Following Zhejiang’s designation as the Common Prosperity Demonstration Zone in May 2021, the province formulated a 2021-2025 implementation plan with quantitative targets. To meet per capita disposable income numbers set for 2025, Zhejiang must realize an average annual growth rate of more than 7.4%.
Why Common Prosperity Counts
There are historic reasons and realistic considerations for CPC to put forth Common Prosperity as China’s major goal for the next 30 years.
With a history of more than 5,000 years, it is natural that the Chinese come to look upon solutions of current issues in history. Under the influence of Confucian culture, the equalization of wealth has always been the ambition of Chinese rulers and the characteristics of an ideal society among ordinary Chinese people. Confucius has said that” the chief of a state need not care for scarcity but for inequality, nor for poverty but for security” (5). Contrary to the primogeniture in western countries, the law of Tang Dynasty (618 -907) stipulated that parents' property should be divided into equal shares among sons. Sun Yat-sen advocate a fair distribution of wealth, in order for every Chinese to have enough food and clothing. One hundred years ago, Sun said that Chinese people are all poor, and the so-called "Wealth Inequality" is just different levels of poverty among poor classes (6). In fact, until the Reform and Opening up in the late 1970s, the first problem every Chinese government has had to face is feeding its population and none has succeeded.
Reform and opening up, embracing a market economy, breaking egalitarianism, and letting some people get rich first, within 40 years, China’s economic clout skyrocketed and people's lives were significantly improved. On July 1, 2021, CPC announced that China has built a Moderately Prosperous society in an all-around way and has ended absolute poverty. After significantly reducing poverty, expanding the middle class and realizing Common Prosperity has naturally become China's next objective.
According to the World Bank's standards and measured by GNI per capita, China is already an upper-middle-income economy. At present, China's unbalanced and inadequate development problems still await solutions, large disparities exist in development between urban and rural areas, between regions, and the momentum of economic growth is weakening. To fall into the Middle-income Trap or to become a high-income country is the touchstone for testing the Chinese model. Only through combining innovation, human capital, and domestic market together can China become a high-income country. The realization of Common Prosperity is not only the result of China's development, but also a driving force.
In addition, Beijing has noticed that global income inequality has become increasingly prominent. In some countries, the polarization between the rich and the poor, the collapse of the middle class has led to a torn society, political division and populism. If polarization cannot be prevented, it will inevitably affect the harmony and stability of Chinese society and shake the ruling foundation of CPC.
The Anxiety of the Middle Class and Unbalanced Regional Development
A rough estimation shows that for 2020, the average annual disposable income of high-income households in China is about RMB 186,000 ($29,000), and that of upper-middle-income households is about RMB 108,000 ($17,000). These two groups total about 440 million people, which is basically consistent with over 400 million middle-income population in China revealed by the National Bureau of Statistics (7). In 2020, the average annual disposable income of the lowest-income households in China is about ￥22,300 ($3,400), there are about 250 million people in this group.
The white collars in China's big cities generally belong to high-income or upper-middle income groups, many of them are new immigrants to big cities. On social media, these people are the most anxious group, they don’t feel happy and secure because of high housing prices, expensive education expenses, medical costs, and pessimistic expectation on economic downturn.
The data from 2020 and 2015 shows that the income share of the middle 60% of households has dropped the most, the income share of the 20% low-income households has declined slightly, and the high-income households has gained the most. This echoes the public perception that it is more difficult for ordinary people to climb income ladder.
The issue of uneven development between regions, an urban and rural areas is also significant. Although slightly down from 10 years ago, in 2020, the ratio of per capita disposable income of Shanghai to Gansu Province is 3.55 and the ratio of per capita GDP of Beijing to Gansu is 4.58. Nor can the development gap within the same province be ignored, even for China's richest provinces. In 2020, 27.4% of the population in Jiangsu is below average per capita disposable income of mainland China, and the number for Guangdong is 41.4%. In China, Zhejiang Province has done the best job resolving the problems of unbalanced development and income disparity.
China has carried out considerable rectification of some Internet platforms and certain industries in the past two years. Many real estate companies have encountered liquidity problems under multiple controls. It is not difficult to find some link between these moves and Common Prosperity. Ant Financial’s prompt IPO would only make a few rich people like Jack Ma and his friends richer, the double reduction in education aims at easing the anxiety and reducing the spending of the middle class on education. The purpose of real estate regulation is to curb some unreasonable market demand and return to the principle that housing is for living in, not for speculation.
How will China Achieve Common Prosperity?
In China, important national plans generally follow the path that CPC central sets the goal, selects local area for pilot, and promotes mature programs nationwide. Zhejiang, one of China's most-wealthy provinces, has been identified to be the demonstration zone for building Common Prosperity. The province aims at achieving Common Prosperity by 2035, 15 years ahead of the schedule set for the whole country.
Zhejiang’s 106,000 km2 area is slightly larger than that of Kentucky. It has a population of 64.5 million, 1.6 times the population of California. From geographical perspective, Zhejiang is a resource-deficient province so called "seven mountains, one water and two fields". But among the top 500 private enterprises in China announced in September 2021, Zhejiang has 96 seats. The words demonstration zone instead of pilot zone shows the affirmation of Zhejiang's inclusive development by Beijing.
Forming an olive-shaped social structure is Zhejiang's path to Common Prosperity. It contains two major tasks - expanding the middle-income group and upgrading the low-income group. Skilled workers, technical personnel, individual business owners, and micro-enterprise entrepreneur are potential candidates for the middle-income group, low-income farmers, migrant workers, and other disadvantaged groups are considered as low-income group. "The Implementation Plan for High Quality Development and Construction of Common Prosperity Demonstration Zone in Zhejiang Province (2021-2025)" released in July 2021 outlines Zhejiang's version of action plan:
1. Pursue high-quality development and create endogenous driving force on boosting Common Prosperity: Focus on three new industry sectors - "Internet Plus", life sciences and healthcare industry, and new materials, build Zhejiang into a technological innovation center of China; form industrial clusters like digital security and integrated circuits that have global influence; expand household consumption and cultivate international consumption center cities.
2. Implement a plan to double the income of residents and middle-income group: Increase investment in human capital, stimulate the income-increasing motivation and let more ordinary workers to enter the middle-income group through their own efforts, and double residents' income in ten years. Stabilize middle-income groups through reducing their expenditure pressure on education, medical care, senior-care, childcare, housing, etc. Improve and standardize the recruitment and selection system for civil servants, ensure fair development opportunities among different groups, and improve opportunities in social mobility.
3.Promote high quality and equalization of public services: Achieve same education quality of primary and secondary schools between urban and rural areas in more than 60% of counties; improve the medical treatment capability of county-level hospitals, and facilitate the establishment of medical consortium of 3A-grade hospitals in counties. Construct an elderly care service system that supports family-based elderly care, build communities with home care service network, and encourage the development of elderly care service institutions that are "built by the government and operated by the private".
After analyzing the reason to select Zhejiang and its action plan, we can see some clues for pursuing Common Prosperity:
Zhejiang is home to the country's most-developed private economy. It also has the smallest poverty gap between urban and rural areas；High-quality development is the foundation and premise of Common Prosperity. It is the pursuit of equality on the basis of wealthy;The construction of income distribution system must pay equal attention to process and results;While increasing income, vigorously reduce unreasonable expenditures on education, housing, medical care, etc;Improve people's livelihood on the basis of economic development and financial sustainability, don't over promise and don't raise lazy people.

What does Common Prosperity mean for foreign investments?
If the 20th century is a century of revolution for China, the 21st century could be a century of evolution. Common Prosperity represents a profound social evolution. It is necessary for anyone who wants to invest in China to understand its background and underlying logic. Making the goal of national rejuvenation a reality is the most important national mission supported by all Chinese people. To fulfill this Chinese dream, the government will always put development on the top of its agenda. China's development will rely more and more on its own strength: a huge domestic market, its own technology, domestic enterprises, and entrepreneurs. The good old days between 1978 and 2018 are gone forever. Still, China will face some unavoidable constraints in future：
Fierce competition between the U.S. and China, and the decoupling of technology between the U.S. and China is inevitable.China's aging population and low birth rate.Addressing climate change - carbon peak and neutrality
• Fierce competition between the U.S. and China, and the decoupling of technology between the U.S. and China is inevitable.
• China's aging population and low birth rate.
• Addressing climate change - carbon peak and neutrality
However, unless China encounters extreme changes (such as military conflicts between the Mainland China and Taiwan), China will maintain policy continuity and stability. When pursuing Common Prosperity, China will remain open to the outside world and continue the system of combining the market and the government, Beijing will not strangle China's private economy in order to achieve Common Prosperity. The real challenge for the Chinese government lies in how to get rid of the fetters of ideology, treating various market entities indiscriminately when implementing policies, and ensuring all market entities are equal before the law. Only in this way can China maintain the vitality of the society and its momentum of economic growth.
Although there will be hesitation from time to time, foreign investment will not leave China. The Chinese market is huge, complicated, and cruel. Participants will either go all out or quit. For foreign companies wishing to participate in the Chinese market, we have some suggestions:
1. Fully understand the intensity of competition and lower the expectation of returns.
2. It is necessary to reach a sort of decoupling for operations inside and outside China through the localization of the market, human resources, and technology.
3. In considering new policies from the Chinese government, foreign companies need to be aware, but there is no need to panic and overreact. The best way to understand a policy is to read its original text and follow up with real implementation. Foreign companies should focus on China's market and consumers.
It is foreseeable that the pursuit of Common Prosperity will significantly expand the middle class in China and increase their spending power. At the same time, foreign companies in China will be subject to more visible and/or invisible constraints, especially the impact of U.S.`-China relations. But overall, opportunities outweigh risks.
