### Bridging a Historical Distance: Japan & China

17 June 2025|China, China history, China politics
At On Global Leadership, our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. We have written about U.S.-China relations, but we thought a lecture from Kenji Kanasugi, Japan's Ambassador to China, would be helpful in understanding how countries across Asia are trying to readjust relations in the shadow of the Trump administration and its aggressive economic and trade policies. What we found especially interesting with this lecture was how the Ambassador is seeking to redefine Japan's history and relationship with China for the 21st century.
The appearance recently of Kenji Kanasugi, Japan's Ambassador to the People’s Republic of China, at Renmin University provides a compelling study in the use of public diplomacy to reframe bilateral narratives and foster generational engagement between Japan and China.

In his lecture and subsequent dialogue with students, Kanasugi effectively moved beyond protocol-driven diplomacy, positioning himself not only as a state representative but as a facilitator of mutual understanding. (1)
Kanasugi entered the Foreign Ministry of Japan in 1983, and has had overseas assignments in Australia, Malaysia, the United States, the Republic of Korea (RoK) as Deputy Chief of Mission, and most recently in Indonesia as Ambassador. But he is not completely ignorant about China.
While Kanasugi said he was not a “China-hand" in his June 10, 2025 speech, he has helped shape Japan-China relations over the last decade. From 2016 to 2019, he served as the Director-General of the Asian and Oceania Affairs Bureau, and later as Senior Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs, which eventually led to then-Prime Minister Abe’s official visit to China in October 2018 to meet with President Xi.
A Experience and Engagement
A central theme of Kanasugi’s visit was Japan’s commitment to transparent, people-centered diplomacy. By explicitly noting that he is not a China expert, Kanasugi immediately acknowledged his position as an outsider to Chinese cultural and political discourse, lending authenticity to his message. This admission framed his presence as one grounded in humility and curiosity, rather than prescriptive authority.
By also referencing his wide-ranging travel across China, including visits to culturally significant sites such as the Mogao Caves in Dunhuang and urban centers like Chongqing, he emphasized experiential learning and regional engagement. His invocation of Dunhuang, a historical nexus of East-West exchange along the Silk Road, served as a metaphor for contemporary efforts to revitalize long-standing cultural ties. Such symbolic framing highlighted the importance of shared heritage as a bridge between present and past relations.
Equally significant was the ambassador’s emphasis on youth engagement. His interaction with students at the university demonstrated the value of direct, unscripted dialogue in addressing deeply rooted perceptions. When a student inquired candidly about lingering Japanese sentiment toward China, Ambassador Kanasugi’s response centered on the role of misunderstanding and silence. He reframed these not as immutable realities but as areas where dialogue could replace suspicion and distrust.

This exchange underscored an important aspect of contemporary Japan-China diplomacy: sentiment between peoples often lags behind the pragmatic cooperation of states. By acknowledging this dissonance, Kanasugi signaled an official recognition of the importance of public sentiment in shaping long-term diplomatic outcomes, especially for two nations that have experienced dissonance in their relations.
The ambassador’s use of social media, particularly his personal Weibo account, represents a novel extension of traditional diplomacy into digital spheres. His informal posts about daily life in China, including seemingly mundane experiences like enjoying local cuisine, serve to humanize diplomatic engagement and lower the perceived barrier between officialdom and the public. In a digitally connected society, such gestures carry symbolic and relational weight, particularly among younger demographics.
Finally, the ambassador’s concluding message, which was posted online following his visit, exemplifies the diplomatic philosophy of incrementalism. His phrase, “One step, one leaf, one future,” captures the essence of a gradual, deliberate strategy: fostering mutual trust not through grand declarations, but through consistent, small-scale engagements.
Kanasugi’s engagement illustrates how modern diplomacy increasingly relies on interpersonal narrative, cultural symbolism, and digital tools to navigate complex historical relationships. His approach suggests that for Japan-China relations to evolve meaningfully, diplomatic initiatives must move beyond state-to-state frameworks and cultivate a foundation of mutual respect and understanding among their peoples.
OGL Impressions of the Speech
Kanasugi’s lecture at the Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies received limited attention domestically, although it contained notably significant information.
This year marks the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II. Japan has repeatedly expressed the feeling of deep remorse and heartfelt apology for its action during the war. Such a position articulated by successive cabinets will remain unshakable into the future.Currently, over 10,000 Japanese companies are operating throughout China with bases at over 30,000 locations. We all know that the Chinese market is highly competitive, and foreign business communities, including Japanese, face numerous challenges and difficulties.A considerable number of Japanese companies, however, have likened China to a "fitness center." Despite the competitive and challenging market environment in China, they see this market as an ideal place to hone their skills and enhance their global competitiveness. These Japanese companies hold a firm belief that they cannot compete globally without succeeding in the Chinese market.The United States is Japan's central ally, and therefore maintaining a stable relationship with the United States is crucial for Japan. Of course, Japan-U.S. relations are not problem-free. On the contrary, as we are all well aware of, a significant challenge is currently posed by the large-scale tariff hikes unleashed by President Trump. The U.S. tariff measures are not acceptable to us.
