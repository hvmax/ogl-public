### CHINA: An Update on the Coronavirus in China

By The On Global Leadership Team
Six weeks ago, we wrote about our political economy analysis of the (then) emerging Novel Coronavirus overtaking Chinahere(publication date February 7). We focused on some economic, political, and social issues we thought might define the virus as it spread across China and across the globe. A few weeks later, our team talked about the on-the-ground experience of those living in Chinahere(publication date March 5). In that post, our team member, Diane Long, articulated a fairly optimistic view about how things were unfolding in China.

Today, things are much different, and, given how much this pandemic has swept the globe, we feel the need to update our views on this issue again. In the weeks since our previous posts, China has gained control over the virus within its borders, and the rest of the world has, to varying degrees of success, dealt with the spread of this global pandemic. Italy, Iran, Germany, Spain, and the United States have seen devastating spread of the virus, and, for some countries (like the United States), we still don’t know where the end is. Illuminating how quickly things can shift in our assessments, just a few weeks after her optimistic analysis of March 5, Diane recently recounted: "Recently I was walking down Julu Road [which is populated by many high end boutique fashion shops]. It was jarring and depressing. I would say 30 percent of the shops were shuttered. The government has done well in containing this crisis, but where it will lead, we still don't know."
In this post, we focus on 1) the economic impact for China, 2) the specific issues as they relate to manufacturing and the supply chain in China, and 3) the continued questions about the political impact for the Chinese government.
As previously discussed, the impact of the Coronavirus for China will be significant but will be mitigated within the year. The economic impact for the rest of the world will be much greater than it will be for China. The supply chain is the big issue for China right now.The political impact for China is less than we originally thought it would be.The societal impact seems to be shaping up into a unifying event rather than a dividing event as we initially thought.

In our original coronavirus post, we wrote: “Most economists we trust predict that China might anticipate a .4 to .6 percentage point drop in GDP growth as a result of the coronavirus. Based on these forecasts, the worst-case scenario is that China’s growth might sink to 5.2 percent. Let’s be clear: we are talking about a once-in-a-decade crisis for the world’s second largest economy, and we are talking about 5.2 percent growth. These are growth rates that Donald Trump can only dream about. (Recall that Trump predicted 4-5 percent growth under his stewardship, but he has never cracked 3 percent.) So, a little perspective here when we are talking about a “radical” decline or slowdown in China’s growth.”
In the six weeks since our first post, conservative estimates suggest we should revive these numbers downward, at least for Q1 2020. Economists and practitioners polled by Reuters are predicting 4.5 percent growth for Q1. However, it should also be noted that, in his call with 170,000 government and ruling party officials a month ago (February 23), President Xi struck a business-as-usual tone: the virus has been contained (in China); time to get back to work; our growth goals have not changed. The party’s “Centennial Goal” of building a moderately prosperous society in all respects (全面建成小康社会) by 2020 has been raised and re-emphasized.
In our Feb. 7 post, we also wrote: “China is transitioning from export-led growth to investment-led growth to consumption-led growth. China sits somewhere in between investment- and consumption-led growth today. Trust us, the Xi Jinping administration doesn’t worry too much about a 1 percentage point drop in GDP growth. Countries that have accelerated growth through investment in infrastructure can pretty easily put their thumbs on the scale of GDP growth by continuing to invest in infrastructure, creating more jobs, building more “stuff”, etc. The debt the government needs to take on to do this cannot be ignored (thus the debt-to-GDP ratio comes into play), but the Chinese Government can always find the resources to stimulate growth if it so desires.”
Now, some Chinese economists have questioned a forthcoming Chinese stimulus package. As reported in theSouth China Morning Post, Liu Shijin, who previously worked closely with Vice-Premier Liu He, the top economic aid to Xi, at the Development Research Centre, the think tank attached to the State Council asked, “Are there other ways out for China except stimulus policies? If it really works, why can’t Japan and the United States reach a 5 per cent growth rate?” So here is the difference: In the United States, in 2018, the current administration set in motion a $1 Trillion stimulus that is set up to boost stock markets and the Dow Jones Industrial Average. This stimulus, which came largely in the form of corporate tax breaks, led to the largest share buyback program in the history of American capital markets. When China engages in stimulus packages, it is largely done through investments in infrastructure, which create jobs rather than lining the pockets of corporate executives. China is just smarter in economic stimulus than the United States is, at least with respect to the current US government. The new infrastructure investments (新基建) will most likely be focused in 5G, AI, bigdata centers, and charging stations, plus the ongoing intercity highspeed rail and subway. The concept of stringing clusters of cities in regional development has been the scene for the last a couple of years. Chinese people think it will bring up the growth level of the cluster and release some structural potential (结构性潜力) in the regional alignment.
So, the key point here is that the economic impact of the coronavirus on China is likely going to be minimal in the long run. China’s quick response (after an initially slow response) and its aggressive authoritarian measures have meant that the containment of the virus has been successful, so Xi’s message of “back to work” is not unrealistic.
Two caveats here:
First, as we noted in our original coronavirus post, the health of the mobile economy is an important key to China’s consumption-based growth: “A number of economists have predicted more dire consequences of COVID-19 than SARS because China’s consumption-based economy has risen from 44 percent to 57 percent. The argument goes that if people don’t venture out to buy things, a larger portion of the economy will take a hit today as compared to 17 years ago. What is never mentioned is how much more mobile the Chinese economy is today compared to 2003. People may be staying inside during this crisis – indeed the streets in major cities like Shanghai are empty – but that doesn’t mean they aren’t buying things. Just stand at the entrance of any residential compound in Shanghai to watch the courier mopeds line up to drop off a myriad of boxes and bags in all shapes and sizes. People may not be venturing out to stores, but RMB is definitely still flowing. China’s mobile/online economy is the most powerful and dynamic mobile economy in the world.”
Second, in our last post, we did not touch on the manufacturing economy and supply chain issues, but these parts of the economy merit discussion here. China’s amazingly sophisticated supply chain has become the manufacturing juggernaut for the world. There are many reasons for the success of this powerful supply chain, and we won’t go into all of these here. However, one of the key components of the success of China’s supply chain is a population of people called the floating population (流动人口), a population of about 200 million migrant laborers who move around the country as a seasonal labor force. This is one of the key secrets of the Chinese manufacturing economy. As different factories and companies need to deal with the “ramping” schedules of new products for their foreign partners, China is able to move laborers around to different parts of the country to serve the needs of Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) serving foreign companies across China. This is accomplished through a complex system called the Labor Dispatch System.
However, this system depends on the ability for people to be mobile. The entire notion of the “Floating Population” is that migrant labor can “Float” around the country to land where they are needed. But what happens if you suddenly have a Black Swan event where you no longer want people moving around the country, as in the current COVID-19 crisis? Then the economics change pretty quickly. So, this is the wildcard for the Chinese economy, and it will be interesting to see how the country deals with this crisis and the core tension of a “floating population” and keeping people where they are. We do not know the answer to this, but we believe it will be a key issue moving forward. Since the Feb. 23 meeting, there has been some pressure to resume work. But for the municipal level party leaders, the political risk of having COVID-19 out of hand is much higher than the economic responsibility of the local management. So, they move very slowly and cautiously. Today, the private sector (non-service) is estimated to 50 percent to 60 percent of previous capacity. If the epidemic control maintains as it is now, we can see things going back to normal in China by the end April.

Political Impact
In our earlier post, we noted a few things about censorship and the flow of information: “There is a sense that the Central Government’s control over information has created a culture that stifles the flow of information. This is a reality that has been generally accepted by the Chinese population. The Chinese population willingly bought into the quid pro quo exchanging political transformation (or lack thereof) for economic development. When the Chinese Government stifles the flow of information, the Chinese populace, for the most part, is willing to abide by the censorship. Today, Chinese citizens discuss this agreement fairly explicitly: citizens of China openly acknowledge that the Party guarantees political stability (稳定), safeguards (保障), and economic development (经济发展); in return, society must avoid chaos (中国不能乱). So, when the Chinese Government censors the flow of information, for the most part, the Chinese populace is willing to abide by this quid (censorship and control) as long as they get their quo (economic development).”
Today, seven weeks later, our team has a distinct sense that the government is being appreciated for controlling the crisis in such an efficient and effective fashion. To be sure, some measures feel draconian and controlling, and, to be sure, we are not talking to all levels of employees and citizens of Chinese society. However, our team’s broader sense is that many Chinese citizens appreciate the rapid stability the Chinese government has brought. Our sense now is that things are more politically stable than we would have projected seven weeks ago. Seeing the West now in such turmoil in both leadership and mass reactions, Chinese people seem to realize that their government certainly was not off by any measure. As one social media denizen recently noted, “We the animals in the zoo are calm, looking out on the wildlife go crazy.”
In our original posts, we also wrote about the societal impact, taking a step back and thinking through what all this means as it unfolds. As our team member, Diane Long assessed the situation in her March 5 post, “The shrill voices of the western press mirrored the cries coming via WeChat and phone calls with friends based in Hubei Province. For those on the ground in Wuhan, it must have felt like Armageddon with long queues of people waiting to be tested, unclear protocols for confirming infections, health care staff lacking proper protective gear and collapsing supply chains. The world watched as China went on to build two hospitals in 10 days, organized medical teams from across the nation, blocked provincial borders, and convinced a nation of 1.4 billion people to stay home. Talk about project management.”
In the last five weeks we see many social aspects being tested in this horrific event, and the question of what the country has learned in the 17 years since SARs becomes critical. The Party learned to allow people to vent; rescuing the population is the Party’s responsibility; communication at all levels and through all channels, must be transparent and consistent. And, once the response mobilization scaled, the grassroots organizations needed to be creative in coming up with ways of managing the self-isolation and local community support systems. China is a very decentralized system, and it is critical that local leaders find their own ways through this crisis.
We also talked about the provincial and ethnic tensions that emerged in this crisis: “Because China's local dialects are so distinctive, people can often be identified as being from a given place. In crises such as this one, discrimination can spread swiftly and widely. If you are from Hubei, you are a target in China right now. An extended family member of one of our team reported the following: In her building complex, it was widely known that one family came from Hubei province. After the Chinese New Year, as people were returning from their annual treks to their hometowns, Public Security Bureau (PSB) officials were waiting for this family. They were not allowed to enter their home and were taken directly to the PSB Station and then transferred to one of the “isolation motels” for 14 days of observation. They hadn’t done anything wrong; they were just from Hubei. There is also the reported case of the Shanghai residents who refused to board an international flight from Nagoya to Shanghai because individuals from Hubei were also boarding the flight. These moments make it clear how Chinese internal social networks can circle the wagons very quickly in times of crisis.”

Today, we feel the tensions between people are abating. Our sense on the ground today is that this is much more of a lesson in how moments of crisis exacerbate cleavages, while processes of reconciliation – groups of people working together toward a common goal of pulling out of a crisis – create a sense of unity. We will see how this crisis continues to unfold for China and for the world.
That’s all we have for now.
All the best from,
