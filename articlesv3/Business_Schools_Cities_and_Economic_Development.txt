### Business Schools, Cities, and Economic Development

AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy and economic development in the United States and China. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. Our team has participated in and written about local economic development in a variety of cities across China and in the United States. Years ago, two members of our team worked hard in building ties between academia (business schools, in particular) and the local communities in which they are embedded (in that case, Washington D.C.) to train students but also to contribute to a vision for the local economy. Together we produced astrategic planfor the city, and it was one of the most gratifying experiences I have had as a teacher and administrator. This post adds to that conversation. – The Editorial Team
The COVI-19 pandemic illustrated ever so acutely that academia doesn’t exist in a vacuum. As universities and colleges shifted to online learning, and watched their coffers steadily shrink, they also found time to work more collaboratively with local public health agencies and other civic groups to assist with COVID-19 testing and vaccine deployment.
This outreach is laudable, and was welcomed by local communities, but it begs the question: why not expand it beyond the concerns of public health? Beyond the few anecdotal examples of economic collaboration over the years, both sides – universities and cities – have always gone to their respective corners to nurse their wounds. Imagine if there had been more active economic collaboration between academia and cities to benefit both institutions over the last two years.
I know something about this type of economic collaboration. In 2011, I was dean of the George Washington School of Business (GWSB) in Washington, D.C. When I arrived as dean in 2010, I was a business school professor and China scholar, and I knew I would have to scale back on my consulting and public speaking, as my focus had to be the school. But I wanted to find a way to help the school contribute to local economic development.
During my time as dean, I led a partnership between four university business schools -- GWSB, the Georgetown University McDonough School of Business, the Kogod School of Business at American University and the Howard University School of Business -- and the D.C. Mayor’s Office that resulted in a new vision for economic growth in Washington.
What made this collaboration unique? It reflected the combined work of 20 creative and dedicated business school students, academic and government leaders, and hundreds of DC-area business and nonprofit executives, entrepreneurs and civic groups. It was a marvel of cross-industry teamwork.
The product of this collaboration was the District’sFive-Year Economic Development Strategy, which laid out a clear roadmap for sustained, sector-driven economic growth. This plan contained the vision, strategies, and initiatives that would transform the District by creating 100,000 new jobs and generating $1 billion in new tax revenue to support city services.
The District wanted to grow its economy and jobs, but up until that moment, it hadn’t had a strategy that evaluated coming changes in the federal sector (downsizing) and other traditional anchors under pressure after the Great Recession. Armed with the intellectual firepower of academia, and the sweat equity of the students, the District developed a coherent strategy that was built on solid economic modeling and visionary projects to recharge the local economy.
In my current position at the Thunderbird School of Management at Arizona State University, I’m seeing similar efforts to support the community’s economic growth through an visionary collaboration known as Phoenix Global Rising. The charge of the project is to coordinate different entities across the city to make Phoenix a more global and attractive city for national and international investment.
The City of Phoenix has already taken its first steps toward becoming that global city by bringing chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) to its community. In an agreement with TSMC, the world’s largest contract chipmaker, the city will provide $205 million in funds for roads and water improvements for the $12 billion semiconductor factory. The facility would eventually employ 1,900 full-time workers. Construction has already started and factory production is expected by 2024.
Both the examples mentioned here illustrate the value of marrying the needs of cities with the intellectual heft and human capital of universities. By offering support, guidance, and even a vision for the future, universities, particularly business schools, can partner with local communities to build back better after the pandemic and provide a welcome opportunity for collaboration that benefits both academia and the cities they call home.
