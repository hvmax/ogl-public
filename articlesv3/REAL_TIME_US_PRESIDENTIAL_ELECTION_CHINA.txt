On Global Leadership’s regular feature OGL Real Time presents our up-to-the-minute insights on current news and events. We hope these breaking news insights from our OGL team members will help illuminate the events of the day and provide the depth needed to understand global political, economic, and cultural transitions and transformations. In this post, we reflect on the U.S. presidential election and what the election means for U.S.-China relations going forward. We examine a variety of important issues raised by this dynamic and the ways in which Intel may be at risk in China today, taking into account our own views as well as what the OGL team in China sees in local media, social media, and popular sentiment.
A week into President-elect Donald Trump’s transition to his second term, the shock has yet to wear off for many Americans who were surprised by his victory on November 5. He won with 75,487,288 votes and 312 electoral votes; Trump took every critical swing state in play. It proved to be resounding, in both results and reaction in the U.S. and globally.
What does it mean for the United States and for U.S.-China relations?
Despite recent rosy financial forecasts, we are at a difficult time economically in the United States. In a previouspost, we wrote, “The United States’ economy started heading south when economist Milton Friedman began to win the argument in the 1970s that truly free markets were the only way to run a healthy economy. In the years since the Friedman revolution in economic policy, we have adopted a stance that maintains states and markets as at odds with each other… [Since 1980] shareholder capitalism and trickle-down economic theory have run wild in the United States, and that run has largely benefited the wealthy and hurt the middle- and working-classes of American society.
“There is a reason that, from 1970 to 2020, the middle class share of aggregate income fell from 62% to 43% while the aggregate income of upper income households grew from 29% to 48% over the same period, according to Pew. This is also the reason that the top 1% of U.S. families control an astounding 38.5% of America’s wealth, the highest ratio of anywhere in the world.”
And, today, we also have the lowest corporate tax rate since 1939. To be very clear, it is our view that we have been favoring corporate interest in the United States since Friedman’s reign began in 1980. Our view is that Trump and Vice President-elect J.D. Vance don’t really care that much about the plight of the working class. They are part of the trickle-down-economic-theory movement that has moved wealth into the hands of the economic elite, including themselves.
During the campaign, Trump and Vance did need to create arguments that would mobilize voters to elect them. These arguments centered around: (1) lies about China “stealing” jobs and the ways in which tariffs would solve the problem; (2) racist tropes about individuals from Latin America stealing jobs and eating cats; and (3) many other anti-LBGTQ tropes about how the “Left” was hijacking our moral landscape. It is a sad time for America. We have elected bullies who do not tell the truth about economic policies or moral, social mores.
First, some of us on the OGL team are a little bit concerned about what this election means for American culture and politics. In an earlier post, we argued that “Trump Still Doesn’t Get How Tariffs Work.” While this sounds dismissive, we also understand that Trump is intelligent, maybe narcissistic, and radically self-interested, but not dumb. For the most part, he is surrounded by able advisors. The likelihood that he does not fully “understand” how tariffs work is small. He probably understands that tariffs arenota tax on China, but he is willing to lie to the American people, as he knows he can get away with it as he builds his narrative. (He also knows a key component of that narrative is popular with voters: “You are hurting economically, and it’s China’s fault!”
What is going to happen to U.S.-China relations under a second Trump presidency? Our OGL Team is of two minds on this one.
Few Tariffs.One view is that Trump and Vance are intelligent, self-interested businesspeople. They will not want to be responsible for the swamping of the U.S. economy. And they probably know very well that our interests are deeply tied to China’s interests. As we have written previously, the reason? Apple is the second most profitable company in the world because of its embeddedness in China’s industrial supply chain. The company is married to China. There is no Plan B. So, the 60% tariffs? We believe it’s mostly bluster, empty words, and it’s not happening. A deal is going to get done that allows the president-elect to not lose face but also not upset the global economy. The Taiwan question? This one is a little more complicated, and we will address it in a future post.
Full Tariffs.We don’t all agree on this view. Our team in China believes that Trump will boost tariffs, maybe not as high as 60-100%, as promised during the campaign, but the increase will come. He has staked too much of his political capital on bringing China to heel with tariffs. They will come, but it is still unclear at what level and for how long. This position is reflected in China’s public opinion.
Public Opinion in China
While the U.S. election has received much attention in China, it has not been discussed as much on social media. The reason is very simple: China netizens believe that no matter who is in the White House, there will be no essential difference in policies regarding China trade and relations. Even so, it is still very important to know the viewpoints of netizens because the U.S.-China relationship today is no longer something that Washington or Beijing can define alone.
The public is remarkably sanguine about Trump’s re-election. This article extracts and translates some representative viewpoints published before and after the election by some key opinion leaders (KOL) on Weibo, China’s X-like service. It must be noted that on platforms such as Weibo, WeChat, Xiaohongshu, etc., more people predicted that Trump would win, including many KOLs who are perceived as nationalist. We have included a sampling here:
A. Uncle Ming’s tittle-tattle – Trump will win
On November 2, Uncle Ming posted: “My ultimate prediction of the U.S. election is that Trump will win.” Below is his methodology:
Answers to two basic questions
1. Answers to two basic questions
Question 1: Is Harris in 2024 weaker or stronger than Biden in 2020? Answer: Undoubtedly weaker.Question 2: Is Trump in 2024 weaker or stronger than Trump in 2020? Answer: Not sure.
• Question 1: Is Harris in 2024 weaker or stronger than Biden in 2020? Answer: Undoubtedly weaker.
• Question 2: Is Trump in 2024 weaker or stronger than Trump in 2020? Answer: Not sure.
2.  Based on the fact that polls tend to underestimate Trump, referring to the 2020 results, Harris’ lead in the Pennsylvania polls suggests that Trump is more likely to take Pennsylvania, a key swing state.
B. Guyan Muchan -Why has China’s domestic public opinion lost interest in the U.S. election?The vast majority of our Chinese people have realized that no matter whether Harris takes office or Trump is re-elected, the U.S. policy of suppressing and containing China will not change strategically, and the difference between the Republican and Democratic parties in their China policy is only at the tactical level... Harris or Trump, it really doesn't matter to China.
C. Xiang Ligang of cctime.com -Trump's election will promote China's high-tech development.For a long time, China did not have a chip (industry) strategy... Thanks to Trump, he wanted to fight a trade war, a technology war, and wanted to strangle our neck, which suddenly gave U.S. a sense of crisis and let U.S. see this strategic problem that had been existed...After 2018, the atmosphere of Chinese society has changed greatly, and it has become a consensus to use China's own products to support China's high-tech development. In the past few years, we have made breakthroughs in many fields such as chips, operating systems, semiconductor equipments and materials, development tools and databases, etc.
D. Jinlun/BAOPUCAIJING -Finale: Trump wins, and times of uncertainty have arrived.Trump's key move after returning to the White House is to cut taxes, and he hopes to reduce the corporate tax rate to 15 percent, which is a good thing for businesses. But continuing to lower tax rates will inevitably further increase the pressure on the U.S. government's fiscal deficit.
Trump faces another dilemma: raising tariffs, that is, keeping out products from certain countries, and trying to control inflation. What to do?
How to reshape the industrial chain and supply chain of the U.S.? With current labor and material cost, it is almost impossible to move most of the low-end industries back to the U.S.... But I'm afraid some high-tech industries (in China) will be hit hard.
E. Flying-Beta - A New Trump, What Does it Mean?!
U.S.-China relations in Trump’s second term:Because of Trump’s policy of fierce confrontation with China, the next four years will foresee the strongest and most troublesome external challenges for China.
Major reason for Trump’s stunning win:Is there a backlash of the U.S.-led globalization after encountering China in the past two decades...The U.S. economy is highly capitalized and hollowed out, without real economy, the middle and lower classes can't afford to live... This is a continuation of the global political and economic changes since the 2008 U.S. financial crisis.
The U.S.-China contradictions:The U.S.-China contradictions are structural and irreconcilable. While Trump represents the transformation of the U.S. from a leader in economic and political globalization to its opponent and a champion of decoupling, China has taken over the banner of globalization.
Elon Musk:I doubt how long the honeymoon period between Trump, a businessman with absolute power, and Elon Musk, a businessman, can be.
The risk of the U.S.-China military collision in future: the risk comes from... miscalculation of both sides on the opponent's willpower. We (China) are almost prepared in terms of science and technology, food, military, diplomacy, strategic materials, etc.
The interesting thing here is China’s pivot away from focus and reliance on the United States and G7 nations. The reformulation of the BRICS Group this year and China’s recent negotiation of the border dispute with India indicate that China’s focus is elsewhere.
As for the official attitude of Beijing, we translated and analyzed congratulatory messages to the President-elect sent by China's top leader in 2016 and 2024.
U.S.-China relations in the next four years will be full of challenges and crises, and if Washington and American people do not understand the true thoughts of the Chinese people and Beijing, a full-scale conflict between the two countries is by no means alarmist.

Beijing Responds
After Harris conceded, Chinese President Xi extended congratulations to Donald Trump on his election as president (1). Here is the translation of Xi’s message:
History teaches that China and the United States gain from cooperation and lose from confrontation. A stable, sound and sustainable China-U.S. relationship serves the two countries' shared interests and meets the aspiration of the international community. Hope that the two sides will uphold the principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation, strengthen dialogue and communication, properly manage differences and expand mutually beneficial cooperation, and find the right way to get along in the new era, so as to benefit both countries and the wider world(Figure 3).
Comparing the congratulatory messages sent in 2024 and 2016(2), we can see some textual changes in the recent one:
The subject of the message starts with two outcomes of U.S.-China relations "gain from cooperation or lose from confrontation"；The expression of future China-U.S. relation development has been changed from "long-term, healthy, and stable" to "stable, sound, and sustainable"；Replace "non-conflict, non-confrontation" with "peaceful coexistence" in the principle of developing bilateral relations, and after "mutual respect" sequentially.
• The subject of the message starts with two outcomes of U.S.-China relations "gain from cooperation or lose from confrontation"；
• The expression of future China-U.S. relation development has been changed from "long-term, healthy, and stable" to "stable, sound, and sustainable"；
• Replace "non-conflict, non-confrontation" with "peaceful coexistence" in the principle of developing bilateral relations, and after "mutual respect" sequentially.
It is reasonable to be pessimistic about China-U.S. relations over the next four years or even longer. Beijing is clearly under no illusion about Trump and has lowered its expectations for the future of U.S.-China relations, and the world turning right is helping China’s conservatives to gain more influence as well. Under the current situation, it is obviously unrealistic for Beijing to talk about the long-term nature of Sino-U.S. relations and avoid conflict and confrontation.
But China still must deal with the negative impact of the upcoming Trump tariffs, maintain bilateral exchanges, and avoid a hot war. If Trump continues to exert maximum pressure as he did in his first term, we are pretty sure Beijing will fight back forcefully. As for when the two sides may reach some kind of deal, it won’t happen without some fierce confrontation.
However, we shall not give up. It is our belief that sound and productive U.S.-China relations serve the interests of the world. In a new era of uncertainty and friction, forthright dialogue, mutual understanding, and constructive cooperation is still essential to make a better America, a better China, and a better world. We can and should make improvements, even in small quarters.

Developing long-term, healthy, and stable China-US relations conforms to the fundamental interests of the two peoples and is also the universal expectation of the international community. I attach great importance to China-US relations and look forward to working with you to expand cooperation in bilateral, regional and global fields based on the principles of non-conflict, non-confrontation, mutual respect and win-win cooperation, manage differences in a constructive manner, and make greater progress in China-US relations at a new starting point, so as to better benefit the two peoples and other countries.
