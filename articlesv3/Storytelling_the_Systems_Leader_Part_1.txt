### Storytelling & the Systems Leader -- Part 1

16 May 2023|Leadership, Leadership Development, Systems Leadership
This is the eighth piece in a multi-partOn Global Leadershipseries on Systems Leadership. Previous posts have developedSensemaking,Solutionmaking, andSelfmakingas “dynamic capabilities” of teams and organizations driven and shaped by systems thinking. Here, we begin to explore the central and complex role of stories and storytelling in the first two of these activities. In a subsequent piece, we will turn to the third, Selfmaking, and the matter of how stories from across all three processes also drive and shape leaders themselves. -- The OGL Editors

When the multinational food and beverage companyMondelez International announced in November that it was evolving its global marketing strategy to “humaning,”Stanford business professor Bob Sutton labeled it“corporate jargon monoxide”and brand consultant Mark Ritson added it to his list of the“greatest marketing BS of all time”. What else is on Ritson’s list? Seth Godin’s assertion that “Marketing is no longer about the stuff that you make, but about the stories you tell.”We open this post on storytelling with this caveat: storytelling has become in many ways a cliché of leadership -- and branding and creativity -- in danger of being labeled “corporate jargon monoxide.” But, we aim to show, narrative and storytelling are integral elements of leadership when seriously understood and used. In this post, we unpack the importance of stories in sensemaking and solutionmaking and in the next post we connect storytelling to selfmaking as well.
To begin, we might ask a fundamental question: what is it that binds people together in projects, teams, organizations, or communities? In other words, when people gather, what is it that shapes their activities and goals together? One answer, of course, is legal and refers to the existence of an entity, like a corporation, recognized by society for its standing in law. A further step in this legal approach might point to the multiple contracts, both within a corporation and with external partners and clients, that define its activities. Another perspective would cite the financial resources and priorities of a group as setting boundaries for what it does in the world and how. A third explanation could be mounted in terms of the technologies or other structural resources that facilitate new types of interactions in a group. MIT Professor JoAnne Yates, for example, memorably argued how the development ofearly information and communication systems, enabled by the typewriter and ‘genres’ like the memo, the proposal, and the meeting, standardized office routines and activitiesin the late nineteenth century, long before email, instant messaging, and video conferencing similarly and more recently have shaped our own.
Arguably, however, while legalese, contracts, financial and structural resources and evolving technologies all play a role in forming the boundaries of organizations and communities, there are other elements at play as well. Creating and evolving shared language, for example, is essential to achieving both efficiency and growth in an organization. Creating new language is a responsibility of leadership. Leadership ensures space in an organization for efficiency, discovery, and invention, and each may be required in different phases of change. Leadership requires that we ask unnatural questions (itself a source of new language) (Esmonde, Gheoghagen, Pangaro & Dubberly 2002). Closely related, an understanding ofwhypeople do things must be “immersed in culture, it must be organized around those meaning-making and meaning-using processes that connect man to culture” (Bruner 1990: 12). Narrative development and storytelling, we posit, involve articulating the meaning associated with an existing culture and exploring and explicating new meanings that drive change and adaptation of cultures over time.
Part of the meaning-making work of leaders (and authors and historians and politicians) involves reframing events of the past in different stories. Just as cognitive scientists have increasingly understood, the brain continually re-makes memories, typically taking some narrative form, thus re-writing stories of the past. For leaders, framing the past and establishing the core elements of the present are aspects of making meaning that allow teams and organizations to come together with some coherent sense of values and views of the world, themselves, markets, and more; in short, engaging in sensemaking. As important, leaders need to envision what may come next by producing stories of the future that, again, others not only acknowledge as possible but attach theirbeliefto as a basis of commitment and action. While necessarily incomplete, these scenarios become the basis for diverse individuals to approach in their own ways -- engineers and marketing teams, for instance, might understand and embrace a strategic plan to launch a new product for very different reasons. This latter work is what we’ve called solutionmaking.
As mechanisms for articulating meaning, for evolving shared language, for propagating culture and for exploring alternative futures, narratives or stories are powerful. That power exists in part because ofthe complexity of storytelling in organizations. Consider the range of types and functions of narratives and stories adduced by University of Bath sociologist Yiannis Gabriel:
Vital parts of an individual’s and organization’s sensemaking apparatusFeatures of organizational politics representing attempts at control and resistanceElements of individual and group identitiesSymbolic artifacts expressing deep mythological archetypesMeans of sharing, disseminating, and contesting knowledge and learning (Gabriel 2000)
• Vital parts of an individual’s and organization’s sensemaking apparatus
• Features of organizational politics representing attempts at control and resistance
• Elements of individual and group identities
• Symbolic artifacts expressing deep mythological archetypes
• Means of sharing, disseminating, and contesting knowledge and learning (Gabriel 2000)
Threading through these diverse functions are the bases of identifying and contesting group values and priorities about who they are and what they choose to do together.
In anarticle on teaching storytelling as leadership practice, consultant Shannon Cleverley-Thompson describes empirical research on leadership and storytelling identifying multiple modes in which leaders use stories. Stories serve as mental maps that indicate what is important and how things are done in organizations (Kouzes and Posner 2012).“...leaders use stories to motivate, inspire, reduce conflict, build trust, influence superiors, and establish a clear direction”(Auvinen, Aaltio, and Bomqvist 2013: 133). Storytelling helps leaders be more strategic and maintain employee loyalty when guiding an organization through difficult changes (Boal and Scultz 2007;Gill 2011) by changing how people think, creating shared vision and granting comfort and hope (Bolman and Deal 2013).
With that backdrop, we turn to an exploration of narrative and storytelling in two of the three major activities that this series has developed as central to the work of the Systems Leader:SensemakingandSolutionmaking. These essential “dynamic capabilities'' of organizations, in simple terms, entail capturing the stories of the present through activities such as environmental and market scans and creating new stories that the organization aims to develop in the future. As we will explore in the next post, these capabilities become intertwined with the ongoingSelfmakingof the individuals (and groups) involved. These interdependent processes occur not only because stories sketch out desired paths forward and outcomes. At the same time, those involved -- both tellers and listeners -- have committed themselves, based on their beliefs, to believe and accept that the stories have relevance and possibility for individuals and groups alike. It is the opportunity of leadership to envision the coordination of these processes to understand the present and then generate alternative futures while motivating individuals to embrace group stories and to grow themselves and their shared undertakings.
In a previous post, we clarified how framing and reframing sit at the heart of sensemaking. The act of framing, communication scholar Gail Fairhurst argues, is “both as a cognitive device and a communicative activity defined by selection, emphasis, interpretation, and exclusion” (2005: 167). Ultimately, framing is “the ability to shape the meaning of a subject, to judge its character and significance. To hold the frame of a subject is to choose one meaning (or set of meanings) over another. When we share our frames with others (the process of framing), we manage meaning because we assert that our interpretations should be taken as real over other possible interpretations” (Fairhurst 2005: 166). To enact these various activities of framing, reframing, and making meaning -- that is, of sensemaking -- we rely on stories and storytelling.
This reliance has deep roots. In his pioneering research, psychologist Jerome Bruner examined “two modes of thought” or cognitive functioning.The first of these “distinctive ways of ordering experience, of constructing reality” is “a good story,” what Bruner calls “the narrative mode”(1986: 11), which “leads to conclusions not about certainties...but about the varying perspectives that can be constructed to make experience comprehensible” (37).  The second mode, of the “well-formed argument,” is what he calls “the paradigmatic or logico-scientific” (12). This latter mode “yields accounts of experience that are replicable, interpersonally amenable to calibration and easy correction” (110). Bruner’s modes can be construed in terms  of the age-old tensions between arts and sciences or creativity and analysis. However, for our purposes, Bruner’s ambitious work underscores how the story-making that occurs in framing and re-framing experience is fundamental to our making sense of specific events or contexts -- say, of the behavioral norms in a given culture.
Recently, in the United States and elsewhere, the political realm has provided conspicuous examples of how the framing and re-framing of reality shape different stories. The Election Integrity Consortium, a group of American misinformation researchers, pointed in a recent report to the centrality ofre-framingto 2020 election misinformation activities on Twitter: “By adding misleading or false statements to what was originally a true story, these accounts were often able to craft their own narratives, using media stories and factual accounts of incidents as the raw material for these misleading messages''(2020: 5). For example, the report describes howmore than 400 military and overseas ballots downloaded in September omitted Mike Pence's name and, instead, listed the Libertarian Party candidate for VP (Jeremy Cohen) as Donald Trump's Republican running mate. This mistake was re-cast by social media influencers as intentional and evidence of more widespread and systematic effort by the Michigan government to engage in fraud. This active rewriting of stories had a far-reaching impact on citizens’ belief in the legitimacy of certain political issues and even the integrity of elections themselves.
While central to the designerly thinking and media studies literatures, storytelling as a means of framing and reframing figures as important in organizational management research. Anticipating Gabriel’s work, organizational theorist Karl Weick recognized many of the fundamental functions of storytelling: suggest a causal order for otherwise discrete events, enable people to talk about absent things, serve as mnemonics, guide action, and convey shared values and meanings (Weick 1995). Put more simply, narrative for Weick is “a sensemaking response to complexity” that enables one to re-make meanings, re-shape activities, and re-draw contextual boundaries amidst uncertainty (Weick 1995, 2008). Focusing some similar insights about narrative, management theorist David Boje argues that the organization itself can be been conceived of as “a collective storytelling system in which the performance of stories is a key part of members’ sense making and a means to allow them to supplement individual memories with institutional memory” (1991: 106). A great and persistent challenge for leadership is to reconcile the many, often discrepant narratives that emerge from individual sensemaking (and identity construction) within teams and other groups.
Meaning-making, while long recognized as a priority for leaders and a function of stories, cannot occur without some consent -- that is, belief -- on the part of individuals and groups. In his trenchant analysis of storytelling,Into the Woods(2014), British television producerJohn Yorke parallels the movementwithin stories-- the hero bravely ventures into the woods, the firm boldly enters the new market -- with the commitment and openness of reader or viewer or team membersto the experience of stories. Like the fictional protagonist or the actual firm, individuals gather around a coherent set of meanings that they track externally while processing internally. The protagonist’s journey, for Yorke, is also ours as a reader, and both of us grow as meanings and understanding evolve. An important parallel exists within teams or organizations for individuals who continually coordinate their own sensemaking and stories -- their identities -- with the belonging that comes from sharing sensemaking and stories with a group, be it a project team, an organization, or a wider culture.
In the design process, stories tend to perform two major functions: they inform or inspire. As one of us (Sara) wrote previously, with Michael Barry, “Stories that inform are the input to the design process; they provide material for the insights that are generated in framing” and re-framing (2009: 310). Those insights, or new frames, in turn are communicated through narratives. As discussed earlier, making meaning with stories is both a fundamental mode of thought and a basic means for individuals and organizations to order events and prioritize information. These“stories in” are the work ofsensemaking. In contrast, “stories out” are created bysolutionmaking(310).“The stories developed to express [insights or] imperatives and drive the development of solutions inspire designers to help their users by “express[ing] meaning-based needs or creat[ing] emotional connection” (311). As to be expected with solutionmaking, these stories use different plots to imagine solutions to problems or suggest the existence of new creative opportunities.
It is helpful, in turn, for business leaders to consider two broad and overlapping dimensions of new or alternative “stories out” created by solutionmaking. The first dimension isexternal. These are stories of corporate origins, entrepreneurial reinvention, community service, and good citizenship -- that is, the stories of businesses that circulate in the marketplace and society that help to shape the wider understanding of those organizations (regardless of their accuracy). Marketers rely on these narratives to construct and differentiate the prospects of a company, its products, and brand. As media and entertainment mogul Peter Guber makes clear in his bestselling bookTell to Win,the value of stories is the “emotional transportation” they offer to customers or clients. That “transportation” may lead to very different ends, of escape or transformation or even-self discovery, but it is ultimately borne on the wings of compelling stories that touch the hearts of customers, partners, collaborators, or investors.
A second dimension of “story out” created through solutionmaking in businesses isinternal. Here, narratives follow what management researchers call an “organizational script,” which management researchers Dennis Gioia and Peter Poole originally conceived as “a framework for understanding the cognitive dynamics underlying many organizational behaviors and actions” (1984: 449). Many of these stories give shape to the cultures of organizations by espousing the values and principles guiding the organization. As such, they capture the defining ways that businesses manage change, solve problems, or otherwise collectively behave. Some are also origin stories or summaries of emblematic figures and experiences that illustrate standards of organizational success and future aspiration. Critically, these internal stories can provide the basis for personal connection, shared purpose, passing on legacy beliefs and local knowledge, and the “emotional transportation” offered to employees.
Whether primarily external or internal (or, often, both), team and organizational stories reflect a defining characteristic of solutionmaking: stories are “living” (to use Yiannis Gabriel’s term) and evolve through repeated iteration and experimentation. In the conclusion to “The Leader’s Guide to Storytelling” (2011), management writer and adviser Stephen Denning develops this point. Rather than being self-contained and complete, in other words,stories should convey essential truths about the business they describe while still having rough edges and opening out to continuing interaction. In this sense, stories become one means conducting the kind of experimentation described in ourprior post on solutionmaking.They allow an organization to try on multiple versions of a narrative in pursuit of the one it will ultimately adopt. The most successful stories, moreover, develop to provide both external and internal functions, serving as the basis of emotional and expressive connectionandfact-based communication with customers, investors, employees, and partners alike.
Orchestrating and sustaining openness and adaptability in organizational and business storytelling are among the paramount responsibilities – and most powerful opportunities – of everyday leadership. Traditionally, corporate or organizational stories were top-down creations, communicated by the C-suite for investors or employees or crafted by the marketing division or external agencies to improve the perception and positioning of the firm and its brand. For Systems Leaders today, the acknowledgment and encouragement of many stakeholder voices contributing to the co-evolution of stories can be a valuable source of differentiation and advantage. In a 2020 position paper, the BCG Henderson Institute argued for sucha shift in the ways leaders can better enable shared understanding, connection, and action. “Effective collective action is not simply project management writ large”; instead, by “creating and propagating the will to act, leaders can more effectively bring about change across a diverse set of stakeholders.”
The wide-scale embrace of shared narratives, and of the iterative and collaborative processes that produce them, captures how solutionmaking both produces new products or servicesandcreates the stories with which leaders and organizations can thrive. Yet co-evolving impactful collective stories is not straightforward. Corporate and brand stories regularly fail to engage customers and succeed in the marketplace. Organizationally, and internally, stories bear heavy burdens: they offer illustrations and the bases of connections for building relationships, defining interactions around team and organizational priorities, and shaping cultures. Stories can fail when they “do not meet the needs of the audience, do not create a clear context or purpose, or the story is inconsistent with what people know to be true (Randall & Harms 2012)”. Good stories can also,as Julian Stodd puts it, fail to scale. Explaining thefailureof some narratives, particularly across large organizations, returns us to the central meaning-making function of stories for both individuals and groups. Viewed in that way, the potential diffusion of and constraints around stories contribute to their ongoing evolution. In some instances, that diffusion and evolution leads to failure or to changes away from meanings that foster cohesive culture and collective actions in teams or firms or even to not seeing when a story needs to change differently in order to contribute to organizational success.
Living stories evolve and meaning-making occurs because of the multiple iterations of different individuals and groups. Besides their potential to fail as well as succeed, a closer look at solutionmaking also reveals how organizational stories take shape through conflict and consensus -- and, as a result, can privilege irrational perspectives and decision-making, occlude facts and evidence, and support bias and exclusion. Consider the performance of “visionary” business leaders (think: Elon Musk) whose communications can manipulate otherwise rational markets and investors. This isthe storytelling myth of the Great Man Leader we previously explored (and sought to bust) in this series. Yet as the analysis of the Systems Leader makes clear, customers and audiences alike respond to leaders’ stories, which may be dominated by mythology, espoused values, and even fantastical claims. As a former business school colleague, a Finance professor, used to say: business is about two things, numbers and dreams -- and, armed with the right stories, leaders and firms can lose the balance and end up designing solutions mostly around aspirational and emotional stories.
To return to the contemporary political realm, considerThe New York Timescolumnist Ross Douthat’s idea ofdreampolitikas a fantastical and posturing way of political storytelling:
This post-election division of the Republican Party extends and deepens an important trend in American politics: The cultivation of a kind of ‘dreampolitik’ (to steal a word from Joan Didion), a politics of partisan fantasy that so far manages to coexist with normal politics, feeding gridlock and stalemate and sometimes protest but not yet the kind of crisis anticipated by references to Weimar Germany and our Civil War.
This is political storytelling no longer leavened by facts or research or even shaped by fully formed alternative historical or ideological narratives. Instead, Douthat goes on, the solutionmaking occurs on a different register: “The Republicans behaving radically are doing so in the knowledge — or at least the strong assumption — that their behavior is performative, an act of storytelling rather than lawmaking, a posture rather than a political act.”
Narratives are tightly interwoven in both sensemaking and solutionmaking activities. Stories heard about and from customers and other external stakeholders provide a cornerstone for framing and reframing. Frames are themselves communicated through stories, critically into the solutionmaking process, the creativity of which depends on internalizing alternative narratives. And the nascent stories generated in solutionmaking are iteratively developed in interactions within and outside an organization. New narratives are then brought to life through their shared development and telling. In short, as Cleverley-Thompson aptly states,“Effective leaders don’t order people to “get motivated,” “get results,” or “be creative,” but they can lead followers to these outcomes through purposeful storytelling. A leader that knows which stories to tell to get their leadership message across in a meaningful way can be more effective at achieving their strategic goals”(2015: 134).
The storytelling of Systems Leaders, as argued above, drives and shapes the sensemaking and solutionmaking of teams and organizations. Yet amidst these ongoing activities, leaders can remain bound by fears about their own storytelling skills and credibility, by unease with telling personal stories, and by uncertainty with the relevance they posit between their stories and the needs of the organization and its people. To understand how stories also drive and shape leaders themselves and enable them to communicate more authentically and effectively with others, we will turn in Part 2 to explore storytelling and selfmaking.
