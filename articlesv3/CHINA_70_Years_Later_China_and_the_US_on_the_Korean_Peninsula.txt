### CHINA. 70 Years Later: China and the US on the Korean Peninsula

21 July 2020|China, China history, China politics, US-China Relations
AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy and, in particular, life in China. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. Among other things, We have sought to advance a conversation about what leadership in these times of crisis might look like. In this post, our team takes an historical look at US-China relations through the lens of the Korean War to help guide the conversation of where tensions might be headed today. – The Editorial Team

Seventy years ago, in June 1950, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) invaded the Republic of Korea to its south and unleashed one of the most brutal wars in world history. Begun as a regional dispute, it quickly exploded into a proxy war with the United States and China wading into the conflict over the spread of communism and the sanctity of borders, respectively.

For the US, the war has largely been lost to history, a three-year conflict on the opposite side of the world supporting an ally that few knew or understood. For China, the war was a battle against US aggression in its neighborhood, a principled fight against overwhelming odds to protect its border from what it perceived to be imperialistic forces.
Since that time, the longer-term significance of the war has gradually surfaced in the fates of its primary combatants. South Korea was able to deter North Korean advances into its territory with the help of the US and the United Nations, and the democracy has since flourished into a global economic power. Meanwhile, North Korea has become a diplomatic outcast and a financial dependent of both China and the former Soviet Union.
But other than honoring the 70th anniversary, what’s to be gained by looking more deeply at this moment in history? We believe much can be gleaned from how China and the US responded so long ago, and to see those decisions in the light of their ongoing conflicts today. China remains a fierce protector of its border, and its fortunes have improved so much since 1950, that it can block any perceived aggression in its region. And while America’s interest in fighting global communism has waned over time, it remains particularly protective of its position as the superpower willing to advance its own interests.
China before the Korean War
In 1949, the newly founded People’s Republic of China (PRC) was impoverished and facing a bleak future. After 30 years of continuous wars, the country was scarred and battered. The population of China in 1949 was 550 million, and 490 million of them were farmers,mostly living in poverty. China’s GDP was USD$28.7 billion, according to the National Bureau of Statistics of China. Crude steel output of the entire country at the time was a mere 0.16 million tons. In comparison, the US was a superpower with highly developed industrial resources. In 1949, US GDP topped USD$270 billion, and its crude steel output was 70 million tons.
The main tasks of the new Chinese regime were to realize China’s unification by liberating Chinese territory, including the island of Taiwan where the former Nationalist government had escaped to with the rise of Mao Zedong, and to rebuild its economy. China’s leaders were even planning to discharge 1.5 million People’s Liberation Army (PLA) soldiers by the end of 1950, but those plans came to an abrupt end.
On June 25, 1950, the DPRK army crossed the border to attack the South, and the Korean War officially began. At the beginning of the war, the North Korean army won one battle after another. It seized the South Korean capital Seoul on June 28; in mid-August, the DPRK army drove the South’s army to Busan, and it occupied 90 percent of South Korea.
On June 26, President Truman ordered the US Air Force in Japan to assist South Korea. A day later, Truman ordered the US 7th Fleet to patrol the Taiwan Strait to prevent the PLA from attacking Taiwan, then called Formosa. On July 7, the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 84, which opened the door for General Douglas MacArthur to lead a force, comprised of troops from various nations, to support South Korea in full. By September 15, UN forces had landed at Inchon, beginning a large-scale counterattack.
Within months, the North Korean troops were pushed out of South Korean territory, and by October, the forces advanced beyond the 38th parallel into North Korea. On October 19, the US-led troops occupied Pyongyang, the capital of the DPRK. Given the progressively bad news for North Korea, China swiftly pushed back on the US. It sent a strong warning signal as the US approached the 38th parallel, letting international forces know it would not accept any incursions beyond that point.
China pushes back
On June 28, as US forces intervened, Chinese leaders had decided to postpone their plan to attack Taiwan, and refocus their efforts on the North Korean border. China soon established a line of Northeast Border Guards, numbering some 250,000 elite soldiers at the China-North Korea border.
In August, as the American troops moved north on the Korean Peninsula, Chinese leaders decided that if they were to intervene, the troops would take the form of Chinese People's Volunteer Army (CPVA). By the time of the collapse of DPRK army in October, China had received telegrams from then Soviet Union Premier Joseph Stalin and a message from North Korea’s Kim Il Sung, both asking China to send troops to support North Korea. By October 25, the CPVA and the US military were exchanging fire for the first time.

Sending troops into Korea was an extremely difficult decision for China's leaders. The fact is US forces were much more powerful, so China consulted with its own allies for support, most importantly the Soviet Union. The nature of the China-Soviet alliance was complicated, and both felt obligated to support their weaker satellite. And although Mao's prestige was in full force in 1950, he still had to face the opinions of other Chinese leaders. Research shows that most top leaders opposed intervention, fearing that China didn’t have the financial resources to commit to the undertaking. It needed to heal from decades of war, if only to give communism a chance to set its roots.
However, China would also pay a heavy price if it chose not to act. US intercession so close to its border gave the US an outsize voice in the region’s future, and could prove a threat to China and its borders for years to come. Plus, if China made concessions, the US would likely ask for more. The loss of morality and national dignity would impact China's international prestige, which Mao valued highly. Additionally, the Sino-Soviet relationship would be changed if the North Korean government decamped to China, and likely more interference from the Soviets would be in the offing. Ultimately, the decision to intervene in the Korean War was made on October 5. The slogan for the movement of troops: “Resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, protect our homes and defend our country”(抗美援朝，保家卫国).
Over the next three years, China would advance far enough south to take Seoul again, and then be pushed back to the 38th parallel by UN forces and a painful stalemate. The Korean Armistice Agreement was eventually signed on July 27, 1953.
China’s decision-making process
China’s resolve in Korea reflected some of the characteristics of high-level decision-making at the time. First, major decisions were made among top leaders in a manner of "democratic centralism" (民主集中). Different opinions were encouraged as long as intentions were sincere. High-level officials conducted their discussions through meetings, such as Politburo meetings or expanded Politburo meetings, and individual conversations sought consensus. After the consensus was reached, the highest leader made the final decision. With the Korean War, that final decider was Mao.
Second, the decision-making process does not affect preparation. Because Chinese leaders had anticipated the developments of the Korean War, military preparations had started way ahead of the final decision. They were not disturbed by the twists and turns of the decision-making process. Once the decision was finally made, troops were available to be dispatched immediately.
Third, the setting of goals was based on objective conditions. In a speech by Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai in October 1950, he described sending troops as a way to, “make the US retreat from difficulties, localize the war and force it to accept peace,” according to Volume 4 of Zhou'sMilitary Selected Works. Despite the US's global role, this was a fairly realistic goal for China at the time.
As this process is unfolding in China, the US failed to accurately read the signs. It mistakenly believed that as long as the war was not extended into Chinese territory, a direct confrontation between China and the United States could be avoided. Circumstance and the arrogance of US officials such as US Army General Douglas MacArthur ensured that US leaders turned a blind eye to repeated warnings from China and other intelligence that pointed to China intervening in strength.
China-US conflict in the new era
Seven decades later, Chinese leaders have not abandoned their resolve in the face of the Trump Administration's diplomatic, military and economic assaults. Despite China's GDP having reached the second largest in the world, its responses have been a strange combination of passivity and duplicitous. Today, the US makes one move and China makes a countermove, and then vice versa. As disconcerting as these moves are, there is a blustery quality to them, as many are propaganda designed solely to respond to internal politics in both countries.
China normally does not confront the US directly when conflicts arise, but they will never act from weakness. Instead, China  follows the decision-making design it established in Korea. China will: 1) Offer a preliminary diplomatic response to emergencies or developments; 2) Further analyze the situation and determine the bottom line for military action; 3) Send warning signals to adversaries and be prepared to take action; 4) Take action if adversaries ignore warnings, following established policy. Already, the world and China have gone as far as stage 3 in its reaction to US activities in the South China Sea and with India along their shared border. We should hope that things will not escalate to stage 4.
Many Chinese people compare the geopolitics of 2020 with those of 1950. China must stick to its bottom line, they say, and prepare for theworst-case scenarioin response to US aggression. As a strategy to cope with the situation, President Xi Jinping proposed in May 2020 that China make full use of its huge market and potential domestic demand to build a new economic model. While keeping open to the external world in terms of trade, China should be prepared to decouple from the US economically, and instead build domestic industrial clusters to ensure economic self-reliance. A game plan like this one prepares China if relations sour even further with the US.
Many believe that resolving the current China-US conflict will also depend on the mutual recognition of the interests of both parties and an open acknowledgement of their strengths. Chinese leaders are confident that China's development potential is bigger than the US in the future. To advance its priorities, China needs to maintain a peaceful international environment while also concentrating on doing its own things well.
Though it is obvious that the competition between the two countries is intense, and often a waste of resources and time, we believe the United States and China should work toward engagement and collaboration instead of a newfound rivalry. Maintaining ties between the US and China will be an arduous task in the coming decades, one that is fraught with financial and geopolitical implications. However, given the history of China and the US, the best way forward is a better understanding of what drives and restrains both nations. History should be our guide.
