### CHINA’S SPECIALIZED INDUSTRIAL CLUSTERS: EYEGLASSES IN DANYANG

27 September 2024|China, Chinese Culture, Economic Development, Supply Chain
AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy and, in particular, life in China. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. We have written about economic development in China and China’s economic reforms, US-China relations, China’s changing role in the global political economy, and the history and current state of Chinese politics. In this post, we continue our work on the hidden strengths of China’s capitalist economy. Common views often depict China as a weakening economy, hobbled by the issues of weaknesses in the real estate sector or an overly controlling central government in Beijing. As we have discussed in other pieces, in our view, China has struck a remarkable balance between building sophisticated industrial clusters but also gradually building the domestic consumption markets across a number of different sectors and products. This post looks at one specific industrial cluster, eyeglasses in Jiangsu Province’s Danyang City.
The Story of Danyang – “The City of Glasses”
“See the beautiful landscape of China clearer with Danyang glasses.” (1)
Danyang (丹阳) is a county-level city under the administration of Zhenjiang City, Jiangsu Province of China. Today, the city is the world’s largest production hub for eyeglass lenses, which accounts for its name, “the City of Glasses.”
Being the hub of the eyewear industrial chain and distribution, Danyang has attracted more than 1.2 million tourists targeting eyewear purchases every year. The first building that passengers see when they walk out of Danyang Railway Station is the Danyang Optical Center [DOC] (2). During the holidays, its parking lot for thousands of vehicles is full almost every day. The eyewear industry is a calling card for the city.
Based on the demand of a huge population, the eye care and eyewear market represents the largest consumer segment in China. Danyang’s eyewear industry and eyewear market provide a vivid angel to observe and understand the dynamics of consumer market in China today. Through the story of glasses, we will explore how Danyang builds its eyewear industry and the making of DOC.
Seeing Through Our Theory
To better understand Danyang's strategy for economic growth, we refer back to our previous analyses about lower-tier cities: Through the lens of Andrew Walder’s (1995) concept of local governments as industrial firms, we can explain that economic development in China is fundamentally shaped by government guidance and centralized control. This has been true since the beginning of the economic reforms (and during the Communist Era as well).
While we often think of the Chinese government as the authoritarian, protectionist, centralized party in Beijing, that is only one side of the government. In reality, local governments are the engines driving China’s growth. Indeed, the Chinese government is an extremely decentralized and entrepreneurial system of district and township governments. The mayors of China’s districts, townships, and villages behave like corporate CEOs, focusing on KPIs, pursuing foreign investment, and advancing their own careers through the financial and economic achievements in their districts and townships. But they don’t do it alone – they do it through close coordination with China’s private sector and with foreign investors from abroad.
Companies like Tencent, Alibaba, and Huawei, but also Apple, GM, Boeing, and Microsoft have worked closely with these local governments to drive a phenomenon of local state competition. What the Chinese have discovered is that private property is not the cornerstone of capitalism, as economists have long thought – local competition is. Thus, while rapid privatization programs were unleashed on the former Soviet Bloc, China carefully set in place a balance between state control and local state incentives. It then mixed this balance with enough autonomy for local governments to go out and recruit partners from the private sector and abroad. It has allowed China to build the most dynamic manufacturing supply chain in the world. And it has allowed China to quietly become one of the most innovative economies in the world. Through our analyses of cases that range from Tier 1 cities like Shanghai, Hangzhou, and Shenzhen to Tier 2, 3, and 4 cities like Changzhou, Zhenjiang, Nantong, Guiyang, and many others, we analyze how local governments are creating the framework for a new economic landscape in China.
“Economic development in China is fundamentally shaped by government guidance and centralized control. There is a lot of strategic planning going on in five-year plans, 10-year plans, and 20-year plans. This has been true since the start of economic reforms and during the Mao Era as well. While we often think of the Chinese government as an authoritarian, protectionist, and centralized party in Beijing, that is only one side of the government. In practice, local governments are the true engines driving China’s growth. Indeed, the Chinese government is an extremely decentralized and entrepreneurial system of district and township governments. The mayors of China’s districts, townships, and villages behave like corporate CEOs, focusing on Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), pursuing foreign investment, and advancing their own careers through the financial and economic achievements in their districts and townships.”
This case study fits easily into our current book project examining economic development in China over the last four decades. First, it is a case where the “local governments as industrial firms” theory plays out beautifully. As we have stated in previous articles and case studies, we tend to focus on the bright, shiny objects that are easiest to notice and see – the fancy economic transformations of Shanghai, Shenzhen, Guangzhou. However, as our team has argued, these bright lights are only a small part of the story. The truly dazzling cases are the smaller 2nd and 3rd tier cities, which have also become entrepreneurial industrial firms and have built industrial clusters that most of the world has never heard about.
But this case is of even deeper interest, because it merges industrial production with consumption. So, the little city of Danyang has become both a hub for industrial production of eyeglasses but also a central destination for the best eyeglass consumer markets in the world.
The Making of “The City of Glasses”
Danyang’s glasses industry began in the late 1960s. Local farmers, though not starving, were keenly aware that to further improve their lives, they had to set up some sort of industries. At that time, a group of opticians from Shanghai and Suzhou returned to their hometowns in Danyang and helped to set up about 20 village eyeglass factories. Although the so-called factories were actually small workshops with limited production capacity and capability, they are indeed the seeds of Danyang’s eyewear industry.
The production of eyeglass lenses required little investment and was easy to get started. In the 1970s, especially after China’s reform and opening up in 1978, many lense workshops emerged in Danyang. Wanxin Optical Group (3), one of the largest lens manufacturers in China, was then known as Danyang Situ Lens Factory, a township enterprise founded in 1973.
The early 1980s saw the arrival of merchants from Wenzhou, and they carried Danyang glasses and sold all over the country. Kangle Inn (the Inn of Healthy and Happy) in Chezhan (Station) Village became the nest for glasses merchants. The inn was in a good location, near Danyang railway station and alongside the road connecting Shanghai and Nanjing. The sidewalk in front of the inn became an open-air market selling glasses. This is the beginning of DOC – a spontaneously formed free market.
In a few years, the 50-meter-long roadside market could no longer accommodate more and more spectacles merchants. Rumors that “the roadside market has seriously affected traffic and the government wants to ban it” spread out far and wide. In an effort to retain this opportunity to make the people in the village rich, Hu Xiaosuo, the party secretary of the Chezhan Village, decided to use the idle fields nearby to build a new indoor market. In October 1986, the new market which cost 55,000 yuan, opened for business, its name Huayang (华阳) was given by then executive deputy county chief of Danyang. One year later, Shuangmiao Village in the north opened the Yunyang (云阳) Glasses Market. The two markets formed the prototype of the DOC, and gained a firm foothold for Danyang’s eyewear industry
In the early 1990s, when imported eyewear entered China, and the eyeglass industry in Shenzhen, Xiamen and Wenzhou emerged and grew rapidly, the competition in China’s domestic eyewear market became increasingly fierce. The lenses produced in Danyang could neither compete with the high-quality and low-cost imported products, especially plastic lenses, nor those more fashionable items from Shenzhen and Xiamen. Under the attack from both domestic and foreign competitors, Danyang’s glasses industry was hit hard.
From the 1990s to early 2000s, the local government of Danyang implemented a series of measures to help the local eyewear industry. The first move was to strengthen the regulation of two markets (5). In a time, glasses were in short supply and demand exploded, the result was immediate: when the quality of glasses in the market was more guaranteed, the transaction volume kept rising. The manufacturing side had also gradually regained vitality with the support of preferential policies. Many glasses factories invested equipment for plastic lenses and launched many new products. Local government spun off large state-owned enterprises with troubled operations, such as the Zhenjiang Optical General Factory. Smaller units after restructuring were more flexible and competitive in the marketplace.
By the end of 1990s, after four rounds of expansion, Huayang and Yunyang markets became connected, having a total construction area of 12,000 square meters. It hosted more than 500 eyewear dealers, offered thousands of varieties in frames, lenses, finished glasses and spare parts. The two markets combined were the largest eyewear wholesale market in China at that time.
Marked by the construction (2003) and the opening (2006) of Danyang Optical Center, the city’s eyewear industry entered a new stage. While maintaining cost competitiveness, the made-in-Danyang products have narrowed quality gap with international brands and design gap with domestic peers, local supply chain was more robust and complete, local brands like Wanxin and Mingyue became China national brands.
In March 2011, the Huayang Market and Yunyang Market were demolished, the new 140,000-square-meter International Eyewear Exchange Building was built on the original site and put into operation in 2014. According to unofficial data, in recent years, DOC has attracted more than 1.2 million tourists annually, and the annual transaction volume has exceeded 6 billion yuan. The establishment of the National Inspection & Testing Center for Ophthalmic Optics Products (2006) and National Intellectual Property (IP) Rapid Rights Protection Center (2017) in Danyang has further enhanced the position of Danyang in eyewear industry.
The evolution of Danyang’s eyewear industry can be divided into the following phases:
Phase 1 (late 1960s - 1986): The start of the industry was almost accidental, with the success of “pioneer enterprises,” a large number of followers emerged, as the industry entry threshold was not high. In a time of short supply, Danyang’s production capacity attracted Wenzhou merchants and thus spontaneously formed a trading market. In this stage, small market entities kept growing without too much involvement from local governments.Phase 2 (1986 - 2003): The industrial cluster was basically formed with an eco-system of production, supply and market. While the industry kept expanding, the homogenization competition became more and more serious. Due to the stagnation of the production technology, most of the products were of low grade and cheap. As the competition from home and abroad intensified, Danyang glasses makers lost market share. To deal with these issues, it was difficult to rely solely on small and medium-sized players, who formed the majority of the industry. As a result, the intervention from local governments at different levels appeared to be natural, e.g. the establishment of Huayang Market and Yunyang Market, providing subsidies to support manufacturers to upgrade production process, organizing local companies to participate in national exhibitions to increase visibility, and so on. Timely, direct and effective government intervention is the key factor to break through the development bottleneck.Phase 3 (2003-2024): Through decades of growth, DOC has established a stable reputation, local manufacturers like Wanxin, Mingyue have grown into the national industry leaders, and international brands like Essilor Luxottica have acquired several Danyang companies. Local governments guide the industry mainly through industrial policies, such as unifying environmental protection standards, building industrial parks, and setting up industrial service institutions like inspection and testing body and IP protection centers, etc.

With the mutual empowerment of the industrial cluster and DOC, Danyang has now become the world’s largest lens production hub and the largest eyewear products distribution center in Asia. The city has more than 1,600 eyewear-related companies, which have created more than 50,000 jobs. Every year, hundreds of millions of lenses are sent to all over the world, and one out of every two new lenses purchased in the world comes from Danyang. It is a remarkable economic development story; a key piece in the puzzle of how China has become the most powerful capitalist economy in the world.
