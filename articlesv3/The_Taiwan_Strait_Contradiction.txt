### The Taiwan Strait Contradiction

18 January 2023|China, China politics, Taiwan, US-China Relations
AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy and, in particular, life in China. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. We have written about economic development in China and China’s economic reforms, US-China relations, China’s changing role in the global political economy, and the history and current state of Chinese politics. In this post, we focus on the China-Taiwan relationship and what the growing tensions might mean for US-China relations and for China’s relations with the rest of the world. (We have written previously about this topichere,here,here, andhere.) In this post, we lay out the fundamental contradiction in the United States’ stance on Taiwan, a contradiction that goes back at least four decades and the signing of the Shanghai Communique in 1979.
When it comes to the sovereignty of Taiwan, the United States has long embraced a level of ambiguity that gives U.S. political leaders the room to support Taiwan’s independence while also publicly recognizing the “One China” policy that was first established during diplomatic negotiations 51 years ago and memorialized in the celebrated Shanghai Communiqué.
Most international treaties focus on agreements, but the Shanghai Communiqué gave both nations a chance to focus on their differences when it came to the question of Taiwan. In the communique, China noted that, “the Government of the People’s Republic of China is the sole legal government of China.” The U.S. section declared, “The United States acknowledges that all Chinese on either side of the Taiwan Strait maintain there is but one China and that Taiwan is a part of China. The United States Government does not challenge that position.”
Since this “constructive ambiguity” was devised, the United States has avoided officially indicating that Taiwan is a part of China, creating a silence instead that has allowed independence sentiments to foment in Taiwan. Recent high-level official visits to Taiwan to meet with President Tsai Ying-wen – including then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. – along with U.S. military aid earmarked for Taiwan have sent an even bolder message. The United States supports sovereignty for Taiwan.
Yet, U.S. officials still claim to have "no position" on Taiwan's sovereignty, basically saying it must be resolved by the mutual agreement of Taiwan and China. We believe that the continuation of this constructive ambiguity is not only confusing to many, but it is also dangerous in the region and globally.
Taiwan’s ties to China
Taiwan has been considered a part of China for more than a thousand years. During European colonization of Asia, Taiwan was colonized by the Dutch. (It was at this point that Taiwan came to be known as Formosa, or “beautiful island.”) Later, as a result of Japan’s defeat of China in the First Sino-Japanese War, Taiwan would be occupied by Japan for over 50 years until Japan’s defeat in World War II, though Japan would not fully abdicate control over the island until 1952.
Starting in 1949, Taiwan’s fate changed significantly. When the Kuomintang (KMT) was defeated by Mao and the Communist Party (CPC), about two million KMT leaders and soldiers retreated to Taiwan from mainland China. Although they had lost the war to the CPC, the KMT, also known as the Republic of China (ROC), claimed it was China’s rightful government in exile. Much of the world accepted this notion, and Taiwan claimed China’s seat on the United Nations Security Council until 1971.
Here again, for China -- a proud, once-dominant global nation -- the threats of colonization at the hands of the West and Japan came shape China’s worldview for years to come.
The breaking of estrangement between China and the United States 50 years ago was no simple negotiation. It was actually one marked by any number of diplomatic twists and turns, overshadowed by a painful past, bruised egos, and ignorance.
After the founding of the People’s Republic of China (PRC) in 1949, China and the United States clashed for 20 years, including two military conflicts, the Korean War and the Vietnam War. During this time, China regarded America as its No. 1 enemy, and the U.S. blockaded China regularly. What eventually cracked the ice between the two countries was their shared opposition to Soviet hegemony. (An irony of sorts today.)
Taiwan’s sovereignty became a factor in U.S.-China negotiations in the 1970s, as Mao and President Nixon looked to open the door to the normalization of formal diplomatic relations. With the re-signing of the Joint Communique by the United States and China during the Carter administration, the United States affirmed the One China Policy, conceding that Taiwan is a part of China.
To be clear, the basic policy of the United States toward Taiwan includes three central points: first, recognizing "one China"; second, not supporting Taiwan independence; and third, maintaining peace in the Taiwan Strait and opposing unilaterally changing the status quo there.
The language of the Shanghai Communiqué and the Taiwan Relations Act complicated this dynamic. The former confused the issue with some constructively ambiguous language, as we mentioned earlier, and the notion it was possible for both sides to agree to Taiwan's future. Currently, they do not. Further, with respect to the Taiwan Relations Act, China believes that this act is a clear violation of the Shanghai Communiqué. In sum, this history is complicated and tensions are clearly rising on both sides of the Taiwan Strait.
International Law
In international law, the fact that a place or location belongs to a country does not necessarily mean that the sovereignty of the place belongs to the country. The relationship can be a "trust territory," "dependency," "territory," or "confederation." The sovereignty of these places is usually not determined. On this issue, China has already stated in the Shanghai Communiqué that it opposes the "inconclusive sovereignty" of Taiwan, but the U.S. statement in the Communiqué did not respond to this.
After the Second World War, the international community had differing views on Taiwan's sovereignty. "Taiwan's sovereignty has not been finalized" was originally a view in some American political and academic circles, and President Truman was one of those believers.
The recognition of the "one China" doctrine is aimed at the "two countries theory" and should also include the "one China and one Taiwan" approach. For China, the focus is recognizing that “Taiwan is a part of China” and that “Taiwan's sovereignty belongs to China.” The United States verbally accepted the "one China" approach, but did not detail its position or even raise objections to these two core elements. China’s criticism of the United States for hollowing out the definition of the "one China" is not unreasonable.
Second, the U.S. has claimed that it "does not support Taiwan independence." And in reality, in its actual behavior, the U.S. does not support Taiwan's independence from a "legal" perspective, though the U.S. position has been ambiguous at best. The United States has never expressed opposition to Taiwan's internal policies and actions to promote or pursue independence. Despite the confusion introduced by the Taiwan Relations Act, the United States has taken steps to prevent Taiwan's Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) from promoting a "legalistic" notion of Taiwan independence. The likely motivation here is to prevent Beijing from having an excuse to attack Taiwan by force. Under this circumstance, China believes it could reasonably use force. From this perspective, the United States' "non support" for Taiwan's (legal) independence is serious.
Third, the position and policy focus is to maintain Taiwan's current status of separation, partition, and actual independence from the mainland, oppose military reunification, and also tacitly oppose peaceful reunification, which is the core element of the current United States policy on Taiwan. The essence of maintaining peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait and opposing unilateral changes in the status quo is, on the one hand, to oppose China’s reunification of Taiwan by force, and on the other hand, to stop Taiwan from moving toward peace talks and capitulation.
The United States wants Taiwan to maintain the "three nos" condition of non-unification, non-independence, and no war in the Taiwan Strait, which was also the long-standing position of the KMT. The only difference with the DPP's Taiwan independence view is Taiwan's "legal" independence. On this issue, many believe the United States has the absolute control over the DPP’s behavior.
The difficulty faced by the United States on the Taiwan issue is how to prevent and stop Taiwan from "falling without war" in the face of China's military development over the past 20 years. That has been further complicated because of the economic and social interaction between the mainland and Taiwan in the past two decades, and Taiwan's increasing dependence on the mainland's economy. The greatest concern of the United States on Taiwan is for China to apply Sun Tzu's Art of War: "subduing the enemy without fighting".
If China decided to unify Taiwan by force, it would inevitably make a full calculation and preparation for the intervention from external forces. After more than 20 years of substantial improvement and development of its warfare capabilities, China could easily deploy a force against Taiwan. Some observers estimated that if the mainland used force, Taiwan might surrender in just a few weeks.
Speaker Pelosi's visit to Taiwan provided an opportunity for China to demonstrate its power blockade, and that China's patience for "peaceful reunification" has been exhausted. Whether the United States supports the defense of Taiwan or if it has abandoned the so-called "strategic ambiguity" policy towards the Taiwan Strait, it may have no practical significance now. The fact is that the United States has already been highly involved in Taiwan's defense, selling more advanced weapons and assisting in the training of Taiwan's military. In fact, the United States is deeply involved in Taiwan's military staff work and intelligence exchanges. The United States regularly expresses its support for Taiwan in order to strengthen and reassure the confidence of Taiwan's society against the mainland.
The Russia-Ukrainian war is being used as a telling precedent by the United States and it has emphasized the deterrent potential of sanctions. If applied to the Taiwan situation, it seems  the main purpose of this series of actions of the United States is less of "using Taiwan to control China", nor to create a "legally" independent Taiwan, but more to show a tough stance of supporting Taiwan. It seems that the United States is really focused on maintaining the status quo of separation and partition between China and Taiwan in the strait.
Judging from the current overall social situation in Taiwan, demand for negotiations with the mainland is very weak, and the support of reunification is even weaker. Although Beijing has made efforts to encourage cross-strait dialogue, there is little chance in the foreseeable future. Further, over some years, Taiwan has been internally delinked China and Taiwan in  society and especially in Taiwan's education system, so the younger generation has little cultural and historical conscientious tied to the mainland besides their shared language.
In order to maintain its hegemony and geo-strategic interests in East Asia, the United States has a contradiction and conflict with China’s efforts to achieve national unity and territorial integrity. The Taiwan issue has become the most dangerous interface point in U.S.-China relations. China strives for national reunification, and the United States wants to maintain the status quo, both for its friends in Taiwan and its own geopolitical interests in East Asia and its global influence.
A unified China with Taiwan firmly in the fold could greatly enhance China’s national strength and fundamentally improve its security environment. For the United States, this would represent a failed policy in the four-decade stare down between the U.S. and China.
The recent National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), signed into law by Biden on Dec 23, 2022, appropriated $10 billion in arms sales for Taiwan, and continues to normalize U.S. military support for Taiwan’s defense. China, of course, responded with 71 jets circling the island and entering Taiwan air space to demonstrate China's willingness to defend its territorial integrity. It is confrontations and maneuvers such as these that, in our view, could lead to confrontation between the United States and China on the Taiwan issue. It is time to set aside the contradictory and ambiguous rhetoric. It is time for clarity in policies and actions.
