### A TRIBUTE TO OUR DEAR PARTNER AND FRIEND DIANE E. LONG

19 September 2024|China, OGL
AtOn Global Leadership, we strive to make the world a little bit better, one step at a time, a few words at a time. We have been fortunate to have a team of people who respect and admire each other as we have built our presence in the world of China and creative leadership. This week we lost our dear friend, colleague, and partner Diane E. Long. The world will miss her generous presence and voice--and we will deeply miss her friendship and partnership.

Some posts are joyous to write – an idea comes into your mind, one you want to share with the world, and you sit down to write, and the words just flow. This post is different. Five days ago, we lost our dear friend and colleague Diane E. Long. Diane was a core member of our On Global Leadership team. It is with deep sadness that we mourn Diane’s passing. Diane was an amazing person, a great source of business vision but also a person who was committed to serving the world.
Diane was also a force of nature. She was a visionary leader who committed her entire life to helping the world understand China. She did so much for the advancement of China’s economic opening, China’s business environment, and U.S.-China relations. She devoted her life to these causes, and her impact will be felt and remembered long into the future.
Diane was also an incredibly generous soul. For many of us, we knew her first through her strong business sense and her commitment to opening China up, but her charity work was every bit as important to her as her work in the business world. Her work as a co-founder and leader ofMingxin Caritas, Shanghai, an organization devoted to caring for Chinese orphans, was inspiring. Over the years, Mingxing Caritas expanded its services beyond orphaned children to also include migrant children, elderly care leprosy, and special projects for impoverished families. I remember many conversations with Diane about her Catholic faith, her desire to give back to the world, her empathy and caring for orphaned Chinese children. Two of these children became a part of her family, and I always remember admiring Diane and her husband Dashiell’s empathy and caring for those who have been abandoned and forgotten by the world.
After graduating from Stanford University in 1980, she worked at a Korean trading/import-export firm in San Francisco until she went to teach English in China with Stanford'sVolunteers in Asia (VIA)in 1985. At the time, there were not many Americans going to live in one of China’s poorest provinces. Diane was that person. She gave her life to helping the world understand China. We cannot underestimate what that commitment and bravery meant. Teaching English in Anhui province in the 1980s was uncommon, and it makes us wonder how many people were changed by Diane's vision, passion, and joy?
I first met Diane in 1994. I was following a lineage of China scholars who had helped change the world’s understanding of China after the Economic Opening in 1979. As I embarked on my dissertation research trip to China in 1994, Thomas Gold, Professor of Sociology at Berkeley, who was my mentor, introduced me to Diane. At that point, she was the in-country representative for Julie Reinganum’s Pacific Rim Resources, a respected consulting firm.
In the 1990s, the expatriate community in Shanghai was still tiny – about 700 people – so we all pretty much knew everybody. I remember feeling a little afraid of and intimidated to meet with Diane. Among the young expats trying to make our way in China, Diane was known as the “Queen of Shanghai.” She was so impressive and so well connected that if you wanted to advance your career or get something important done, you needed to figure out how to get on Diane’s radar screen. Later, she would become the President of Shanghai’s American Chamber of Commerce (Shanghai’s first female AmCham President) and then the China lead for such global brands as Liz Claiborne and Adidas.
Diane’s impact on my career was significant. Thirty years ago, when I was a young, aspiring, China scholar, I wanted to gather data from Chinese factory directors -- data no one had ever been able to access before. I didn't want data from the State Statistical Bureau; I wanted behind-the-scenes data from the accounting books of companies that were state-owned enterprises. I wanted to sit down with these factory directors and hear how they were doing. I was a little naïve, and Diane, rockstar that she was, was kind enough to take a meeting with me.
During the meeting, Diane sat passively, listening to what I wanted to do. After explaining my plan, there was a long moment of silence; I sat waiting for the advice, judgement, dismissal. Then Diane said, “Why don’t you come work for me?” I stammered, “No, no, I am not trying to get a job, I have to do my dissertation research.” Diane gently cut me off: “I know. I hear you Doug. I know what you are trying to do. But you need to learn how to do it. You should come here and work with my team. Listen to the ways in which Leslie and William do their cold calls. Shadow them on some interviews. You’re a smart guy, and your Chinese is good. After a few months of working with my team, you will learn how to do what you need to do.” She was so confident, so sure. I just listened to her and put my faith in her. And she was right.
After a few months of working with her team, I was ready for my dissertation research. And off I went. (And that dissertation would win a national award largely because of the research methods I learned from Diane and her team.) That moment with Diane, and her interesting mix of intellectual ambition, business acumen, and generosity had a huge impact on my life.
We remained friends over the years. I went off and had an academic career and then went to work in the corporate sector for a while. All the while, we stayed in contact. We rekindled our friendship when I moved to Shanghai to work for Apple, and I had a chance to get to know even more about the trailblazing woman she was. I also got to know what a kind and loving wife and mother she was.
When I left China in 2019, having spent the years 2014-19 there, I returned to academia, and started a new venture, On Global Leadership (OGL). Then COVID hit and I suddenly felt the fear of not being able to be back in China, the place I loved to study. I immediately called my dear friend Diane, and she, her husband, and their business partner Chris Gao, became the co-founders of OGL-China, our boots-on-the-ground team in China. Thirty years after she took me under her wing and taught me how to conduct deep research in China, we were back in partnership, learning from each other once again.

For the last five years, through our work with OGL, we have continued to learn from each other and continued to try to help the world understand China a little better. Every week, our OGL team talked on a Zoom call, and Diane shared her insights and guidance. She was wise, knowledgeable, and undeterred in her commitment to helping the world understand her adopted home. It has been such a gift to know Diane for decades now, and such a gift to have worked closely with her these last five years.
Devastating as this news has been, I wanted to celebrate Diane, a brilliant, creative, thoughtful force in the world. Thank you, Diane. Thank you.
