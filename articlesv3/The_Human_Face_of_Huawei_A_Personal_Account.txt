### The Human Face of Huawei: A Personal Account

13 January 2020|China
Several years have passed since I spent time in the regular company of executives from Huawei, China’s largest private technology company. At that time, Huawei was under the gun for its sharp-elbowed capitalism and its audacity for trying to better the West at technological innovation.
When I was first introduced to Huawei, I was a New York University professor who consulted with global companies about entry into China. Later as Dean of the George Washington University School of Business, I worked with Chinese companies to help them fight negative perceptions and gain entry into the American market. My goal was to learn as much as I could to help reveal the truth about the company.
As a long-time China scholar, who had worked with many U.S. and Chinese companies, I was confident of my perceptions and analyses of who these companies were. Over time, I became convinced of the good faith of Huawei and its executives, despite persistent attacks from members of the U.S. Congress and the American business community.
Nearly a decade later, I was at the tail end of my time as an executive living in China working for a U.S. technology company, and Huawei was in the headlines again. I felt like I was reliving a dream, or a nightmare, where Huawei was being strategically smeared, as a multinational the west couldn't trust, in general, and as a strategic threat with its 5G dominance, in particular.
In the spring of 2018, I flew to Shenzhen to spend some time with Ken Hu, the vice chairman of the Board of Directors at Huawei. I then went on to have lunch with the charismatic Chen Lifang, Huawei’s senior vice president, board member and the head of the company’s government affairs office. Everyone inside Huawei refers to her as Madame Chen, a sign of deep respect for her nearly 25 years with the company. In person, she is a youthful 48 and seemingly without pretense. Between Ken Hu and Madame Chen, I knew I was looking at Huawei’s future.
I was there to take the temperature of Huawei’s standing globally and to ask how the company could best fight off attacks from protectionists in the west. I playfully reminded Madame Chen that when I used to visit with Huawei executives years before, all of the leaders used iPhones over their own brand; today, I observed, they all use the P30, Huawei’s top-level smartphone. Madame Chen pointedly noted, “iPhones were better than our models back then, we all knew that. But not anymore. We are right there with [Apple].” She smiled as she delivered the blow. She then went on to opine about Huawei’s aggressive investment in R&D, its world-leading position in the development of 5G technology, and its work in Artificial Intelligence.
The current tensions with Huawei are not new, of course. Its attempts at U.S. engagement have long been overshadowed by congressional concerns about the threat of cyber espionage. As I talked with Madame Chen on the Huawei campus, she showed me the enormous and beautiful tapestries her husband, a respected Chinese artist, had crafted that hung on the walls of the Huawei headquarters. He had captured images that were big and bold and took up entire walls in the executive quarters. Somehow the paintings reminded me of Huawei’s own ambitions.
What has stayed with me since our lunch is the overwhelming sense of resignation I felt. Madame Chen understands what few in the west are willing to acknowledge. China is surging ahead of the west in innovation, even without its old tricks and dodges around intellectual property. Instead it is succeeding with a muscular, homegrown invention and innovation. Companies like Huawei are catching up, and the only answer to their achievement is that western companies must work harder. And engagement and partnership would serve all of us better than isolation and competition.
I had also come to Shenzhen that day to see old friends like Ken. I don’t use the term “old friends” lightly. In the summer of 2011, Huawei executives saved my life (or at least saved me from an operation that would have amputated my arm). This very personal story reflects how an unexpected and intimate week – both frightening and comforting at turns – spent with Huawei executives still shapes my thinking about the company today.
An Opportune Break
In July of 2011, I arranged a trip to China to visit the leadership of Huawei. As dean of a major US business school, the company had sought my help in thinking about its public relations in the United States, and I felt that it was important to take a closer look at Huawei and its efforts to expand into the United States.
My interest in the company had increased because I felt congressional hawks were out of step with the company I observed and knew. I decided to spend more time with Huawei’s senior brass. Meeting executives in global corporations – and getting to know them and gain their trust – can be a long process, but it is essential to developing a deeper rapport.
On this day, I was in the middle of a fascinating conversation with Charles Ding, president of Huawei North America, and we were headed off to meet Ken, who then (and still) served as the company’s deputy Chairman, Chairman of the Board of Huawei North America and Chairman of the company’s Global Cybersecurity Initiative. I had been waiting to meet Ken for some time.
Walking out of the logistics department of Huawei’s massive headquarter campus in Shenzhen, I had good reason to be distracted. As a researcher of Chinese organizations and the Chinese economy, I had long found this company to be impressive and wanted to meet with the senior people to find out what made Huawei tick. Suddenly our lunch plans veered off path. I missed the last step on a short flight of stairs, tumbled forward and my shoulder slammed into the bumper of a parked car.
My right upper arm bore the brunt of the impact, leaving my humorous shattered in 17 pieces, with bone fragments jutting out of the skin of my upper arm. Needless to say, our lunch plans were off, but the personal risk for me was greater than just missing a meal. I am not a medical expert, but, as I understood it later, there are dangers that accompany a shattered bone like this, and the break was bad enough that there was no hope the bones would knit themselves back together in a cast. In a four-hour reconstructive surgery, a team of Chinese doctors inserted two titanium struts and 15 pins that would hold the bone together while it healed. I was told I would not be able to leave the hospital for two weeks.
It was not the best way to end what had been a productive week in China. Yet, as the week unfolded, I realized that my time in the Chinese hospital under the watchful eye and solicitous care of the Huawei leadership would prove to be a deeper and different kind of access than any I had ever had as a researcher. It was a rare, uninterrupted opportunity to delve deeply into the culture of one of China’s most innovative companies, and to gain a better understanding of the opportunities available to the United States if it opens its minds and doors.
Huawei and the U.S.
The search for knowledge about China, its economy and its companies, is more essential today than ever before, mostly because there is so much misinformation about China in the United States. We cannot continue to pretend, over and over again, that direct investment from China and every Chinese company that seeks to invest and expand in the U.S. pose fundamental risks to us as a nation. But this is what we are doing, and, for this reason, I have focused my attention on learning as much as I can about the U.S.-China trade relationship and the organizations that represent the greatest challenges to that relationship.
When we think about corporations, we often think of massive, powerful entities making inhumane decisions to turn a profit. We think of steel companies crushing labor at the turn of the 20th Century; we think of mining companies working with authoritarian governments extracting rare earths in the service of global electronics; we think of child labor in Asia sewing running shoes. More recently, we think of social media companies selling their users’ data in a business model that views that private data as the most valuable commodity they have; we think of Chinese technology companies that are in an unholy alliance with the Chinese government.
In China, Huawei has long been considered the model “home-grown multinational,” a star among the many companies that have risen in the last two decades. Its product lines include wireless networks, fixed-line networks, optical networks, data communications networks, value-added services, handsets and terminals. It has become a true powerhouse in the telecommunications industry.
Some corporations do better than others in conveying who they are – conveying their good intentions at sticking to their stated values. And some leaders are very good at articulating their corporations’ journeys in walking this path. Apple CEO Tim Cook, for example, is very good at articulating those values and convincing the world that his organization works hard to adhere to them. Through audiences with leaders of the United States and China, Cook has done very well in convincing these governments and the rest of the world of Apple’s good intentions.
Ren Zhengfei, the founder and Chairman of Huawei, not so much. The reclusive leader of China’s largest privately held company is, at best, sparing in his public statements or public positions. However, the simple fact that a corporate leader is not great at public relations does not mean that the company is culpable of all the infractions and rumors that circulate around it.
For three decades, I have been a China researcher who built credibility and understanding about China’s economic reforms through access, on-the-ground relationship building and deep analysis of the country and firms I was seeking to understand. And Huawei has been a target of that observation for a significant amount of time now.
As responsible investors and consumers, it is incumbent upon all of us to learn and understand what we can about the companies we are judging – even if leaders like Ren are not particularly good at it themselves. In my years before joining Apple, I had a life as a professor of sociology and management before my deanship, and in those years, I made it my business to understand a variety of clients as deeply as I could. Huawei was one of those clients, and, due to some very strange circumstance, I came to know and trust the leaders of Huawei as intimately as I have known any corporate executives.
U.S. protectionism has long been a concern when it comes to Huawei – the world’s second largest telecommunications infrastructure company (2nd to Ericcson) and second largest smartphone maker (2nd to Samsung) that was thrice denied access to the U.S. marketplace – is a critical test case in this vital area of U.S. economic development. The U.S. Congress’ blocking of Huawei deals with Sprint-Nortel, 3Com, Qualcomm, and Broadcom, as well as the recent blacklisting of the company make clear how aggressively the U.S. government has targeted the Chinese technology giant for more than a decade.
Huawei has long been the target of two of these crusades. In 2010 as a result of heavy lobbying by the U.S. government, Sprint rejected Huawei’s bid to help the mobile provider modernize its network, despite the fact that the deal would have clearly benefited Sprint. Then in early 2011, the U.S. government scuttled Huawei’s bid to buy a significant stake in 3Leaf, an American server network firm. The reported reason for the U.S. intervention in both Huawei cases was that its ownership of a U.S. company could compromise American security.
At that time, I spoke with Bill Owens, the former CEO of the now-defunct Nortel (whose alliance with Sprint put them in the middle of the Huawei-Sprint deal). Owens has impeccable credentials in both the intelligence community (as a retired admiral) and in the telecommunications sector as former CEO of Nortel and director of various other telecommunications organizations. In that conversation, Owens’ sense of disgust and loss was obvious. As he put it, “The deal was done, and it would have added $1 billion to Sprint’s bottom line. But for political reasons, the administration stepped in…. So much capital in China is sitting on the sidelines, and we need it desperately, but they just couldn’t see it. The whole thing is killing the American telecommunications sector.”
That argument failed to win the day in the U.S. House of Representatives. In the fall of 2011, the U.S. House Committee on Intelligence launched an investigation reflecting the view that the expansion of telecommunications companies like Huawei into the United States represented a threat to national security, a persistent if unproven charge. At that time, U.S. Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Mich., the committee chairman said, “We are looking at the overall infrastructure threat, and Huawei happens to be the 800-pound gorilla in the room.… As the formal investigation begins, I stand by my caution to the American business community about engaging Huawei technology until we can fully determine their motives.”
Earlier in 2011, in order to calm fears, Huawei had hired John Suffolk, the former United Kingdom chief information officer, as its chief cybersecurity official. At the time, his job duties included, “monitoring and improving all aspects of information security across Huawei's global supply chain” and overseeing the “delivery of telecommunications networks based on the security requirements of...customers and the jurisdictions in which they operate.” If that doesn’t represent a concession to the West, I’m not sure what does.
When Huawei came under fire again in the past year, this time from the Trump administration –extending as far as Huawei being briefly blacklisted by the Department of Commerce – it reminded me of this disquieting past. I reached out to Ken to get his thoughts on the current affairs. It was a great conversation and re-connection. Ken reminded me that even before the current administration, the United States has had a complex relationship with China, and increasingly difficult relationships with Chinese companies such as Huawei – but Huawei seems to have been more of a target than most. Those relationships are becoming even more problematic now, at a time when we can ill afford it.
Even today, with Secretary Ross’ statement that there would be a 90-day reprieve for Huawei so that U.S. Internet service providers could have “a little more time to wean themselves off [of doing business with Huawei],” there seems to be a full-throated crusade against the company. Secretary Ross punctuated this announcement, saying, “We now have more than 100 subsidiaries on the [banned] Entity List… adding more entities makes it more difficult for Huawei to get around the sanctions.”
An Economics Lesson
If the United States is going to have a chance at winning the next century economically, foreign direct investment (FDI) in the United States will be an essential requirement, and our most important partner in this endeavor will be China. For that reason, we need China more than it needs us. Yet, instead of focusing on how to rebuild skilled labor, how to foster competitive business environments and how to attract FDI back to the United States, we obsess over issues like China’s currency manipulation or low-scale IP theft as the source of our problems.
Meanwhile, China sits on more than $1 trillion in U.S. currency – money it is looking to invest abroad – and we have become one of the more protectionist economies in the world, especially with respect to China. We do not create business-friendly environments for our own businesses, part of the reason they go abroad, and we do not create business-friendly environments for capital coming back, which we sorely need.
Among our top 10 trading partners, China bears by far the largest burden of our mistrust and protectionist measures. We have seen this approach in the Trump administration’s skepticism of China and Huawei, but this is a long-held view. By some estimates, over the last decade, China would have been willing and ready to invest $200 billion a year in the U.S. economy. But we are so skeptical and apprehensive about China’s motives that we would rather reject these overtures and risk the future of the U.S. economy than figure out how to work with our largest trading partner. At best the views of China derive from a shallow understanding of China and companies like Huawei; at worst they are politically driven protectionist positions that are not good for the U.S. economy in the long term. The ultimate irony is that the largest communist polity in the world is much more hospitable to business than the world’s largest capitalist economy.
For many in the United States, the common assumption is that greater protectionism is the easiest way to create American jobs. By making imports more expensive, there is less incentive to buy abroad and less incentive for American corporations to take their production facilities overseas. The net effect will be the creation of American jobs. Buy American and, more specifically, buy goods that are produced in America, and the U.S. economy will grow because the wages will stay in the U.S. consumer economy. There is an obvious logic to this view. If it were possible that greater protectionism would bring all of the jobs that have moved offshore back, this would be an appropriate policy to adopt.
Unfortunately, the logic of offshore manufacturing is so much more complicated today than it was when the practice was pioneered in the 1960s and 1970s. Today it is not just a matter of finding the cheapest labor; it is also a matter of balancing access to internal markets, access to skilled labor, balances of trade and internal politics.
Take, for example, the case of Wal-Mart, which is the single largest exporter from China to the United States. Protectionist policies such as tariffs (or a forced appreciation of the Chinese yuan) are not going to bring Wal-Mart’s manufacturing back to the United States. The company is far too committed to and embedded in the Chinese economy – as exampled by its access to China’s internal markets – to imagine that higher export prices or trade barriers would bring Wal-Mart’s manufacturing processes back to the United States. This part of protectionism is simply a nonstarter.
However, there is a second protectionist position the United States has taken over the last couple of years that is equally disturbing. In the wake of four decades of offshore manufacturing, the United States has sent a lot of cash overseas to pay for the goods produced in locations like Japan, Taiwan, the Philippines and China. It is through this process that Japan became the No. 1 controller of U.S. cash reserves in the 1980s, as China is the top holder today. Currently China sits on some $2 trillion in U.S. cash. The advantage for the U.S. economy would be reinvesting this money in America in real estate, developing projects or acquiring companies. But the U.S. government seems disinterested in the flow of such resources, at least with respect to China.
In 2005, when the Chinese National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC) attempted to buy Unocal, Congress stepped in and declared – in the name of U.S. national interest – that a Chinese state-owned enterprise (SOE) could not own a U.S. energy company. In August 2005, CNOOC, a publicly traded company, withdrew its bid to acquire the American company, though it had made a fair tender for the acquisition. A similar signal was sent when the household appliance giant, Haier, attempted to buy Maytag. In this case, Congress did not step in directly, but it was reported that Haier withdrew its bid out of fear of political repercussions.
There may be a legitimate case for not wanting China’s SOEs to buy U.S. oil or technology companies. National security should not be ignored when contemplating transactions of import; nor should we dismiss accusations that a Chinese company might have ties to the Chinese military. Thus, we might well understand the U.S. positions against CNOOC or ZTE (another major Chinese telecommunications company, which is state-owned and was also a suitor for Sprint). Haier, on the other hand, seems like an obvious case of congressional activism gone awry. In that case, a privately held Chinese company (Haier was a converted collective not an SOE) was bidding to buy a struggling U.S. company that makes washing machines. There can be no conceivable reason beyond American pride that a Chinese company be excluded from pursuing a legitimate market offer.
The situation with Huawei lies much closer to that of Haier than to the cases of CNOOC or ZTE. Huawei has argued convincingly, I think, that it is an employee-owned company like any other in China and denies any ties to the military. What I believe Huawei is being forced to do, quite unfairly, is live down its founder’s resume and China’s history whenever it seeks to invest overseas. (Chief executive Ren once served without rank in the People’s Liberation Army’s Engineering Corps.)
Ken Hu offered a credible defense when those charges surfaced again in early 2011. “It is a matter of fact that Ren is just one of the many CEOs around the world who have served in the military, and it is also a matter of fact that Huawei has only offered telecommunications equipment that is in line with civil standards,” Ken wrote in a letter in response to critics of the 3Leaf deal. “It is also factual to say that no one has ever offered any evidence that Huawei has been involved in any military technologies at any time.”
There is so much misinformation as well as a calculated misdirection about Huawei in the media and from certain policymakers. It was for this reason that I went to Huawei to meet with Charles and Ken that fateful week in 2011. I wanted to see if I could reconcile what I have read and learned about Huawei over the years with the realities of the company today.
Awash in Goodwill
A Chinese hospital is a bit like you would imagine it to be: very crowded; “underdeveloped” compared to “western” standards; many, many people clamoring for attention; and rooms clean enough but not what one would call comfortable. Given my condition, I was lucky to have been taken to the best Chinese hospital in Shenzhen, as this is where all the best doctors were located. I was also lucky to be with powerful people who helped me bypass the sea of people waiting for attention; and Ken and Charles flew in the best surgeon to work on my arm.
As soon as I fell, Charles and his staff sprang into action. I was first taken to a medical facility on the Huawei headquarter campus. An x-ray was taken and processed with remarkable efficiency. Then we went straight to Beijing University Hospital, Shenzhen. Any foreigner who has ever tried to navigate Chinese society can attest to how important power, connections and resources are in this society. Of course, this is true in any society to some extent, yet it is far truer in a shortage economy, which China was for many years under state socialism. But in China today, despite the fact that the market is fairly robust, there is still a strong residual of “guanxi” practice. (Guanxi means social connections or ties; guanxi practice means the leveraging of these connections to get things done.) As soon as we left Huawei’s campus, Charles was on the phone leveraging connections to get me the care I needed. Even in my state of delirium, I recognized what was happening, and I was glad for it. Huawei’s name carries great weight in southern China, and the fact that Charles and Ken were behind my case meant something.
As I muddled through the rest of that first day, I have this vague recollection of the seas of humanity and bureaucracy parting while powerful people guided me through the system. I felt mildly guilty for this, as there were many people who looked needy in the hospital that day. But in the end, I was happy for the guidance, navigation and care. By the time I was ready to go into surgery at 4 p.m. that day, seven Huawei people were on hand to see me through this ordeal. Suddenly I had Ken, Charles, Lily Zhang, Flora Chang and three Huawei doctors sitting by my side (all crowded into a very small Chinese hospital room).
For the next nine days, at least one Huawei person would be by my bedside for every hour of every day and night. I spent the week having daily conversations with various executives. I kept thinking to myself, “Don’t you guys run a huge global corporation? How do you have time to spend hours just hanging out with me?” These were fascinating conversations, as I learned many things about the company that you simply can’t get as an outside researcher or over a brief lunch. As someone who is passionate about getting the deepest, most accurate picture of what is really going on with China’s economic reforms, the pain and suffering of the week might just have been worth it.
When I finally convinced the hospital to let me leave after six days (the Chinese hospital beds were a little hard on my poor bourgeois back) and move to a hotel, Huawei rented a room right next to mine and, again, posted a person there around the clock, just in case I had any need.
Defending Huawei
Huawei’s track record merits legitimate interest. It is one of the few private companies onFortune’s Global 500. By the numbers, Huawei is an impressive company: It had $107 billion in revenues in 2018, has been awarded numerous awards for innovation and possesses tens of thousands of patents in 20 countries. With corporate headquarters in Shenzhen, the company does about 50 percent of its business in Asia (about 33 percent in China) with the rest spread throughout the rest of the world. Huawei began international expansion in emerging markets in the late 1990s and has a significant market presence in Europe and Africa and has been serious recently about expanding into the United States. In the early 2000s, the company was also renowned for its alleged patent violations with Cisco, which were settled out of court in 2004. In 2010, there was another lawsuit with Motorola, which had plaintiff suits running in both directions, and was settled very quickly, with neither side admitting wrongdoing.
Then there was the blacklisting by the Trump Administration, and further allegations by members of the legislative branch. In the summer of 2019, U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., issued his own pronouncement about the dangers of Huawei and 5G:
“[Huawei] has attributes of a private company, but it is without doubt a ‘national champion’ of the Chinese government that is seeking to dominate 5G [data networks] across the world… They both cheat when it comes to international commerce, and they are a tool of state espionage and state interests that run counter to our national interest… I don’t think Huawei is a company that should be allowed to operate in America, nor should our businesses be able to sell semiconductors or any of the other basic components that they need to continue to carry on the operations that they are doing.”
We’ll get to the allegations by the Florida Senator, but let’s start with Huawei’s ownership, which is both simple and complex. Despite reports to the contrary, Huawei is not and has never been a state-owned company. It has never been favored by the state apparatus and has never enjoyed special treatment from the Chinese banks (as is often reported). Ren founded Huawei in 1987 after his relatively short PLA service. He was not part of the Chinese security apparatus, as has often been reported. Privately held companies are under fewer requirements for reporting board structure, ownership share distribution, etc., so there has always been less transparency with the organization than is the case with publicly traded companies that are dealing with public requirements.
Today we know exactly who the board members are (as reported annually since 2011 by Huawei at the request of the U.S. government), and we know that the largest shareholder is Ren, with 1.4 percent of the shares in a company of 97,000 people – fairly low as far as ownership concentration goes for a large privately held company.
The concerns over Huawei doing business in the United States are these: (1) As a privately held company, Huawei is not nearly as transparent as a publicly listed company is, especially in reporting board structure. (2) Whatever its ownership, Huawei is an agent of the Chinese state, particularly the military and the state security apparatus. (3) Huawei’s role in manufacturing telecommunications infrastructure could open U.S. networks up to cybersecurity threats. My analysis of these frequent critiques of the company is wholly my own and formed based on a review of the company’s internal documents and from pointed questions directed at Ken, Charles, Madame Chen, and others in the company over the course of the week I spent with these individuals.
First, the transparency issue could easily be assuaged, many journalists and critics have asserted, if Huawei would only undertake an Initial Public Offering (IPO). However, the nuances of an IPO in China are considerably complex. Huawei actually did attempt an IPO in 1998, but several issues got in the way at that time. For one thing, an international IPO was out of the question at this time, as the Chinese government was working very carefully to prepare the way for PetroChina to be the first international IPO to come out of mainland China in the reform era (2000, NYSE). In addition, even if Huawei was to attempt an IPO on the domestic exchanges (Shanghai or Shenzhen), the central government made it clear it was going to limit the amount of capital Huawei could raise, so that it would not overwhelm the state’s favored telecommunication firms, such as ZTE (whichisa state-owned enterprise). Given these constraints, Ren thought it meaningless to embark on an IPO if the company’s ability to raise capital was going to be constrained.
But the current IPO problem is tied to the ownership structure of the firm – and to peculiarities of Chinese securities regulation. As a private company, Huawei has worked to incentivize as many employees as possible through ownership. Sounds like smart capitalism, right? The only problem is that under China’s Company Law and Securities Law, the rule in China is that if a firm is to be publicly listed, no more than 200 employees can own shares. Currently, more than 61,000 of Huawei’s 97,000 employees own shares in the company. In order for Huawei to undertake an IPO, it would have to trample on the employee-ownership options of about 60,800 current employees. This is quite a dilemma, and it is not surprising that the company’s leadership has resisted this road.
Second, with respect to Huawei being an agent of the Chinese state, this argument perhaps dates back to a 2005 Rand Corporation report, which argued, in classic neo-realist logic, that the Chinese government and military would make telecommunications a cornerstone of its next global push toward geopolitical control. The report went on to name Huawei and ZTE as the two key players that would likely be helping the Chinese government in this endeavor.
When I asked Ken about this report, he actually spoke quite eloquently about it, saying, “I actually think this report was extremely intelligent…. There may be some real merit to what they are predicting. The only problem is that we are not coordinated with the Chinese government or the Chinese military the way they say we are. We are just not in those circles. We do very little business with the Chinese government at this point, and we are not a state-owned firm. But once it was out there, it seemed like everyone took it for granted that it was true.” If anything, according to Ken, the Chinese government has a somewhat cool relationship with Huawei because of Huawei’s competitive position vis-à-vis ZTE and because it has been so openly critical of China’s company and securities laws.
With respect to working with the Chinese government, Huawei bids for this work just like any other company does, and Chinese government contracts (including government grants and PLA contracts) constitute less than 1 percent of Huawei’s business at this point. Cisco does a much higher volume of business with the Chinese government than Huawei does. When Huawei is simply lumped in with the likes of ZTE, whichisan SOE (despite its publicly traded status, which officially makes it a “joint stock” company), it is simply a sloppy characterization of what this firm is about.
The third issue, whether doing business with Huawei opens the U.S. government up to cybersecurity threats, builds on the former two propositions. If Huawei has not been transparent enough in terms of ownership structure or in terms of its relationship to the Chinese government or military, the company is working hard to make those issues clear now. But the larger problem with conversations over Huawei’s cybersecurity agenda on behalf of the Chinese government is that these allegations often emerge from behind closed doors on the U.S. side.
For one thing, Huawei at least deserves to be considered in a different category than ZTE. But, more importantly, no one ever seems to mention that Huawei was the first Chinese vendor to use third-party verification through the well-respected Virginia-based Electronic Warfare Associates (EWA); that it is the only Chinese company to have established a Global Cybersecurity Task Force to work directly with international governments (with great success in Canada and the United Kingdom) to develop ways to mollify the fears of international governments; and that it is the only Chinese vendor to have set up a North American Cybersecurity office, according to Andy Purdy, Huawei’s Chief Security Officer since 2012.
Beyond the misinformation or gaps in the reported facts, even more shocking to me is how little accountability there is for these reports on the U.S. side. I have never seen it detailed, for example, where members of Congress, like Senator Marco Rubio, are getting their information or who is supporting their lobbying on this issue.
As Ken reflected on the issue, “We know that China’s reputation in the area of cybersecurity is very bad, but we are not China. We can’t change where we were born, just like you can’t change who your parents are, but wecanwork very hard with governments around the world to help them understand that we are not part of the problem. In fact, we want to be part of the solution. We want to have the best standards in the world in terms of how we deal with cybersecurity issues.”
A Complicated Surgery
Unaware of the complexity of the operation I was undergoing, I walked into the operating room that Thursday afternoon with a certain level of confidence. After all, I was healthy; they were giving me local anesthesia; and I was going to be awake the entire time. What was there to be afraid of? But as I lay on the operating table, I was actually more frightened than I imagined I would be.
It is a funny thing about language. If you have been studying a language for a long time and are quite comfortable in navigating daily affairs, you can easily lull yourself into thinking you are fluent in another language. (For me, it’s Mandarin.) When you are in an important contract negotiation or you find yourself lying on an operating table straining to catch everything that is going on, you start to realize how much of the language you don’t know. And when someone starts poking around your jugular vein with a sharp needle (for the local anesthesia) asking you questions in between jabs, it focuses your attention.
Throughout the operation, every time my anxiety climbed, I calmed myself by thinking about Charles and Ken, who were standing right outside the operating wing, waiting for me to emerge from this ordeal. Nothing can replace family and close friends in times like these, but powerful people who so obviously care for your well-being has to be the next best thing.
Given their stations in life, they could have easily justified sending someone to wait for me. They did not have to come visit me every single day (usually twice a day). They did not have to provide round-the-clock Huawei staff to cater to my every need, including sending chef-prepared meals to the hospital twice a day. They did not have to hire a separate nurse who stayed by my side the entire moment. And when it came time for me to fly home, Charles did not have to fly across the Pacific with me, just to be sure that I made it home.
A cynical party (especially one from a litigious society like our own) might argue that this is all to be expected. The company might have been terrified of a lawsuit and wanted to go out of its way since I was, in fact, injured on its property. But take it from someone who experienced this outpouring of goodwill and sentiment that is not what was going on there. The fact is these individuals simply cared about what happened to me.
I believe that all good quantitative analysis must be supplemented with face-to-face interaction with decision makers. In all the research I have done on Chinese ownership patterns over the years, the occasions I have spent a significant amount of time with a company’s senior leadership have yielded the most critical intelligence – information that provides a greater understanding of China or the business I seek to analyze.
My unexpected stay in China, under Huawei’s watchful care, proved significant for me both in my own personal life and my assessment of this corporate powerhouse. Does my experience tell us indisputably what Huawei’s intentions are? Obviously not. Does my treatment from Huawei guarantee that they aren’t agents of the Chinese government? Of course not. But I do have a greater sense of trust that these individuals and this company are who they say they are.
In my decade of interactions with Huawei executives, I find them to be passionate capitalists working within an elaborate system, which includes both the complexities of the global economy and the complications of dealing with their own government. They are evangelists for their company, evangelists for innovation, and they are working to shed the stigma that comes with Huawei’s origins. My sense of them is that they are honest businesspeople who feel a sense of responsibility to those they work with. That’s something to be emulated not spurned. Corporate America would benefit from having more not fewer companies like Huawei in its ranks, a company that respects differences, keeps its commitments and behaves honorably. But, if nothing else, politicians and pundits owe this company an honest and balanced assessment – not one that is driven by the interests of those trying to score political points that should be addressed elsewhere. Given what is happening in China right now, it is right to be nervous about the future of the with respect to cybersecurity and AI, but it is also right from a capitalist and democratic mindset to treat global companies like Huawei fairly.
