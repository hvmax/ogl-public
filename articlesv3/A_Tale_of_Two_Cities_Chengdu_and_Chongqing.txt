### A Tale of Two Cities: Chengdu and Chongqing

5 July 2021|China, Economic Development
AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy and, in particular, life in China. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. We have sought to advance a conversation about the U.S.-China relationship, and a deep understanding of local economic development in China. We have been writing about the U.S.-China Trade War as it relates toChinese Innovation;entrepreneurship in China today;anda series aboutChina’s Belt and Road Initiative. More recently, we have focused on thestrategic strength oflocal economic development in China’s 2nd and 3rd tier citiesand a broader analysis of China’s leading cities and clusters of economic development. This post adds to that conversation. – The Editorial Team

Many of the OGL articles on economic development in general and the transformation of China’s cities in the reform era specifically focus on development strategies and economic transformation. However, China has a deep rich culture with thousands of years of history as the foundation for that culture. As with our recent article on theLoess Plateau, in this article we focus on the historical and cultural evolution of two important Chinese cities.
Chengdu (成都) and Chongqing (重庆) are both mega cities in China, and their love-hate relationship has lasted for over two thousand years. Chengdu and Chongqing are located in the west and east of the Sichuan Basin, respectively, and both cities were established more than 2,300 years ago. Chengdu was the capital of ancient state of Shu and is now the capital city of Sichuan Province. Chongqing was the capital of the ancient state of Ba (1). After the Yuan Dynasty (元朝) formally established Sichuan (四川) Province in 1286 AD, Chongqing belonged to Sichuan. By June 1997, Chongqing Municipality was established and is directly under the central government.
In 2020, the Chinese leaders in Beijing predicted that “profound and complex changes continue to take place in the current domestic and international environment for China” (2). The development of the Chengdu-Chongqing region has become another major initiative for China in response to these challenges. In 2021, the status of the Chengdu-Chongqing city cluster was elevated to the same level as the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, Yangtze River Delta, and Pearl River Delta city clusters in China's 14th Five-Year Plan, which aims to build the region into a growth engine for the West.
Chengdu Dujiangyan - The Patron Saint of the Land of Abundance
Dujiangyan (都江堰) is an ancient waterworks about 60 kilometers (km) northwest of Chengdu, it is the oldest and only surviving no-dam irrigation system in the world. Dujiangyan is a sustainable water conservancy project. Making full use of local geographical conditions, it diverts water without dams and irrigates by gravity. On May 12, 2008, the 8.0-magnitude earthquake severely damaged Dujiangyan City, but Dujiangyan itself suffered only minor damage. For more than 2,200 years, Dujiangyan has served the role of flood control and irrigation. In 2021, its irrigated area exceeds 670,000 hectares. Dujiangyan was approved by UNESCO in 2000 as a World Heritage Site. The world heritage convention describes Dujiangyan: “The Dujiangyan Irrigation System, begun in the 2nd century BCE, is a major landmark in the development of water management and technology, and is still discharging its functions perfectly.”
The Chengdu Plain became a place of prosperity after Dujiangyan was built. Since then, the Chengdu Plain has been called “the Land of Abundance” (天府之国), and Sichuan has become “The Great Rear Area” of China. Some 2,200 years ago, one important factor for the state of Qin to unify China was the continuous grain supply from Shu region. At the end of the Southern Song Dynasty, the taxation and resistance to Mongolian invaders in Shu and Ba area allowed the Southern Song Dynasty to survive for another several decades. During the Second Sino-Japanese War in the 20th century, Sichuan once again became China's rear area for its rich products and plentiful people. For 8.5 years, Chongqing in eastern Sichuan became the temporary capital of China and the command center of the anti-fascist war in the Far East.
For more than two thousand years, Dujiangyan was a witness of history and the Patron Saint of the Sichuan Basin.
Chongqing Diaoyu Castle - the Fortress that Changed the History of the World
Diaoyu Castle (钓鱼城), located in Hechuan District and northwest of Chongqing, is a legendary military fortress that changed world history. Diaoyu Castle is 91 to 186 meters above sea level, covers an area of 2.94 square kilometers, and is surrounded by water on three sides. In the 13th century, the invincible Mongolian cavalry swept across the Eurasian continent. In 1259 AD, the Mongol Empire’s fourth khan, Möngke, led a 200,000-person army to conquer the Southern Song Dynasty. The 20,000 defenders inside Diaoyu Castle fought against the Mongolian army for six months. The Mongolian army had to withdraw and Möngke died on the way back (3). The siege of Diaoyu Castle detoured the history of Mongols and had great significance in the history of China and the world. The Mongol troops immediately withdrew from Syria and East Asia, followed by a four-year Toluid Civil War between Mongol’s two younger brothers, Kublai and Ariq Böke, and eventually the division of the Mongol Empire. The battle of Diaoyu Castle fully demonstrated the bravery and skillfulness of the people in the Ba area. From 1243 AD to 1279 AD, this unbreakable fortress resisted the Mongol army for 36 years.
In history, Ba or Chongqing is known for periods of chaos and turmoil. Today, while the majority of tourists to Chengdu visit Dujiangyan, most visitors to Chongqing have not even heard of Diaoyu Castle. If Möngke Khan underestimated the resistance of the Diaoyu Castle, now Chongqing seems to overestimate the attraction of Diaoyu Castle to tourists. For most of the time, the quiet 700-year-old fortress sits lonely at the intersection of three rivers.
The Character of Two Cities – “Generals Born in Ba, Ministers Born in Shu”
Chengdu and Chongqing are like Athens and Sparta. The centers of the two cities is about 320 kilometers apart, less than a 4- hour - drive. The two cities have many things in common: they speak Sichuan dialect, eat spicy food, and enjoy Sichuan opera. The culture of the two regions is called "Bashu culture" by people outside the Sichuan basin. However, the Chengdu and Chongqing actually have different temperaments and personalities. The most vivid description of such difference is “Generals are born in Ba, Ministers are born in Shu”(巴出将，蜀出相). The Ba people have developed a hot temper, hard-working character and the spirit of adventurousness, as a result have made more generals. The people in Shu are content with the status quo, they like reading and playing Mahjong, therefore there are more civil official and elegant people in Shu area. The reasons contribute to the distinctive culture characteristics between Shu and Ba are:
The difference in geographical environment.Chengdu is on the plains of the western Sichuan Basin, the construction of the Dujiangyan has irrigated thousands of hectares of fertile fields. The fertile land, the mild and drizzle climate have cultivated people in Chengdu with peaceful and relaxed attitude, elegant and reserved style. In Chongqing, the mountains are high, the water is deep, and the land is barren. Its climate is hot in summer and foggy in winter. The harsh natural conditions have forged Chongqing's perseverance and courageous character, as well as rebellious spirit.

Economic differences. In the period of agricultural civilization, the economy of Shu has always been ahead of Ba. As the core of the Shu area, Chengdu is the most developed commercial city in southwest China. During the Northern Song Dynasty, Chengdu's commerce was highly developed and issued the world's earliest paper currency "Jiaozi". In such environment, people in Chengdu have a meticulous lifestyle, they like fine food and exquisite silk.The difference in the humanistic environment.The stable economy and political environments of Shu have created its unique and long-standing culture. Some of the most prominent writers and poets in Chinese history like Li Bai and Su Shi are from Shu area.

The situation “Rich Chengdu” and “Poor Chongqing” had not changed until the late 19th century. For foreign business people who wished to develop trade in the Sichuan, the Yangtze River controlled by Chongqing was the best way to enter this commercial virgin land. On March 31, 1890, Chongqing was opened as a commercial port. The business atmosphere made Chongqing unique among the isolated southwestern cities, including Chengdu. After the opening of the port, Chongqing quickly narrowed the gap with Chengdu. During the Anti-Japanese War, many factories moved to Chongqing, made Chongqing's industry surpass Chengdu. Since becoming a province-level municipality in 1997, Chongqing has gained a higher political status than Chengdu and an equal economic status.
To the surprise of many people, Honor of Kings (王者荣耀or Arena of Valor)，Tencent’s most successful mobile game with 100 million daily active users worldwide is developed in Chengdu. But this shouldn't be a surprise. Compared to enthusiastic Chongqing, Chengdu is calm and confident, and that culture gene has turned into the soil of innovation.
A city’s image comes from its character. As “a city that you don't want to leave to when you come” (4), Chengdu successfully interprets the connotation as “the Capital of Leisure.” Labels like “Mountain City,” “Fog City,” “Bridge City,” and “Hotpot City” are the best public descriptions of external impressions of Chongqing.
The Future of the Two Cities: From Competition to “Coopetition”
In 1997, Chongqing was separated from Sichuan Province and became a province-level municipality. For Sichuan Province, what have gone with Chongqing are its largest port, almost all automobile industry, more than 30% of GDP. The largest industrial city in the province has now become a major competitor. To cope with the challenge, Sichuan has devoted almost the whole province to develop Chengdu in an effort to check and balance Chongqing. In the race to be the leading city in the western region, the two cities have been competing for projects, investments, talents, and preferential policies. After Chongqing brought in Ford and General Motors, Chengdu shook hands with Volkswagen and Toyota. Both cities have identified electronic information industry as an important economic growth engine. When Intel went to Chengdu, Chongqing set up a microelectronics industrial park and attracted companies like SK hynix. HP is in Chongqing and Dell is in Chengdu. Foxconn hopes to please both cities by producing tablet computers in Chengdu and mobile phones in Chongqing.
Becoming a financial center and comprehensive international transportation hub has been included in the 14th Five-Year Plan of the two cities. The results of competition on the one hand are the prevalence of local protectionism, repeated construction, and industry homogenization; on the other hand, both cities have risen significantly in the economic rankings among cities across China.
Although the central government approved Chongqing and Chengdu as national central city respectively, the dual-center-concept has not reduced the competition. In January 2020, the Central Finance and Economics Committee meeting attended by China’s top leader proposed “Promoting the Construction of the Chengdu-Chongqing Economic Rim.” Since then, people have seen the hope to turn competition to coopetition. Some changes have been observed: two municipalities have more coordinated and joint decision-making, more mutual recognition at operation level. On social media, the public opinion atmosphere has become harmonious, with fewer accusations and provocations between netizens and more calls to learn from each other. Although these changes have not yet involved deep-level benefit distribution and many people still have doubts on whether the two cities can achieve integrated development,
Chengdu and Chongqing have taken the first step in cooperation after all. It is foreseeable that preferential arbitrage between Chengdu and Chongqing for investment projects will be very difficult, overlapping projects will decrease, more joint efforts to win support from Beijing are expected. The key to the development of Chongqing and Chengdu in the future is whether they can break the wall of administrative regions to create and gain a bigger market.
Most tourists who have been to Chengdu or Chongqing have probably tried their local specialty - the hot pot. The Chongqing-style red soup hot pot is thoroughly spicy. In Chengdu, the double- flavored hot pot is more common. The hot pot is like a shrunken Sichuan Basin, it accepts all kinds of ingredients and turns them into delicious food. Both Chengdu and Chongqing are cities with unique history and culture. Can they move together out of the Sichuan Basin and into the future?
