### Notes from Horseback: Nothing Replaces Boots on the Ground

A long-term China resident shares reflections on the impact of change through her personal observation. As we gallop across the China landscape “watching the flowers from horseback,” we can only take some notes.  Will we go back some day for a closer look?
January 23 2020.  That’s the day China’s world changed. The day the mysterious virus in far off Wuhan went viral, globally. As we were collectively winding down business across Shanghai for the Chinese New Year (CNY), family gatherings and the cost of pork were the topics of the day.  Suddenly, in a moment, the China world pivoted into crisis mode. We were self-quarantined, deputized and masked.
The shrill voices of the western press mirrored the cries coming via WeChat and phone calls with friends based in Hubei Province. For those on the ground in Wuhan, it must have felt like Armageddon with long queues of people waiting to be tested, unclear protocols for confirming infections, health care staff lacking proper protective gear and collapsing supply chains. The world watched as China went on to build two hospitals in 10 days, organized medical teams from across the nation, blocked provincial borders, and convinced a nation of 1.4 billion people to stay home. Talk about project management.
Here in Shanghai we settled in for a long winter’s nap. Or did we? Those of us with boots on the ground can observe and signal future game changers, highlighting a different reality from the one described in foreign news media reports:

Home delivery. Packages and bags of various sizes piled up at the entrances of residential compounds and signaled shopping had not stopped. Residential compounds were closed off to outside delivery services, but the results of online shopping were obvious at the entrances. (As a good corporate citizen, Alibaba warned investors of a potential drop in sales, though it has canceled the seller’s fee for 2020.)  The question is what’s trending now and for the near future?
Grocery stores. The system still seemed to be working at the major supermarket chains where fully stocked market shelves of fruits and vegetables spread confidence. During the annual CNY holiday, it’s not unusual for some items like fresh milk and meat to not be replaced so quickly. Shoppers were more strategic than normal, stocking up on disinfectants and dry goods to reduce the frequency of trips to the store. That stockpiling was not so much the result of fears of shortages but rather an overabundance of caution to avoid infection. And food never goes out of fashion.
Silence on the streets.Let’s face it, fewer cars resulting in improved air quality was something we’ve been craving for years. Why not enjoy it with a brisk walk along the Bund, Shanghai’s famed riverfront.  We just might get used to this reframing of our expectations, becoming a game changer for the enforcement of environmental laws.
Online schools.The launch of online learning with fully hatched software solutions that were developed for the Chinese market over a holiday. Someone was busy. We just downloaded the software for our kindergartner, created by the education company that owns his school. Our ninth grader started spring semester, according to the original schedule, via an online app with the textbooks couriered to our door. This opens a whole new chapter for online learning and meeting spaces. Maybe we don’t need to spend so much on real estate for offices and schools after all.

Health care centers. Hospitals moved swiftly to reinforce online appointment systems, publicizing WeChat-based platforms as well as third-party appointment management firms. Suddenly, the patient experience at a large public hospital like Shanghai’s Fudan Zhongshan Hospital became comfortable with payment lines shorter and wait times for appointments briefer. The entire process, from temperature takers to appointment confirmation to obtaining one’s prescription, including diagnostics and blood work with reports, was completed in a couple of hours rather than days. It was breathtaking. Do we see higher prices for doctors seeing fewer patients spread across more hospitals?
With the Western press focused on empty streets, closed shops and muted subways to the casual observer life had stopped. Actually, daily Shanghai life continued to chug along, evolving with the situation, offering insights for future analysis.
