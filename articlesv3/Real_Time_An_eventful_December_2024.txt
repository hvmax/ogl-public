On Global Leadership’s regular feature OGL Real Time presents our up-to-the-minute insights on current news and events. We hope these breaking news insights from our OGL team members will help illuminate the events of the day and provide the depth needed to understand global political, economic, and cultural transitions and transformations. In this post, we focus on the events and activities regarding the U.S.-China relations in the final days of December 2024.
On December 12, 2024, news came out from CBS News that President-elect Donald Trump had invited Chinese President Xi Jinping and other world leaders to his inauguration in January. The invitation comes despite Trump’s repeated plan to impose massive tariffs on goods from China. What are you seeing on social media in China regarding this unorthodox move and what’s OGL’s reading?
As of December 18, with the exception of a vague mention of the matter byGlobal Times, there was no news of Trump’s invitation to President Xi in mainstream Chinese media or government websites. A blogger on Chinese social media said that at the regular press conference of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOF), spokesperson Mao Ning responded to a question about the invitation saying that she has no information to share. We have checked the text of Ms. Mao’s speech at the press conference on MOF website and can’t find what the blogger said. There are also unconfirmed sources quoting Mr. Qiu Wenxing, China’s embassy minister: “It shows that the President-elect’s transition team attaches great performance to the working relations between the Presidents, and between the Chinese government and the transition team,” when he attended the Institute for China-America Studies (ICAS) 2024 Annual Conference on December 12, 2024, in Washington, D.C.
Lacking official exposure, the news has received low attention on Chinese social media. Most of the commentators do not expect Xi to fly to the United States for the inauguration, as Donald Trump is expecting. There are doubts on Trump’s motives, such as, “What kind of kindness is this? It’s clearly another “Trump-style” diplomatic trap,” or “This does not mean that Trump wants to repair the relation with China, very likely he just wants to add international influence through his inauguration.” Some other bloggers paraphrase the comment of Taiwan’s United Daily News “the United States has psychologically accepted China’s superpower status.”
Is it possible that Xi would even consider attending the presidential inaugural on January 20?
Inviting China’s top leader to the inauguration seems like a clever move, full of Trumpian tactical calculations. How Beijing will respond depends on one or all of the following:
Whether the U.S. side has sent out a formal invitation, not just a verbal one. After four years of dealing with each other, Beijing has a full understanding of Trump’s arbitrariness and backtracking. Without a formal invitation, the Chinese side will probably laugh it off as a Trump impromptu performance.Second, whether there are other activities besides attending the inauguration, such as a work visit. China’s top leader will not fly to Washington just to attend a “diplomatic show”.Third, Trump has claimed that he will raise import tariffs on Chinese products immediately after taking office. He’s going to do it for sure, but the secret lies in the scope and the magnitude. If there is some mercy on new tariffs, China may give Trump something in return.As the President-elect wants to make the inauguration a global party, other guests will also influence Beijing’s decision.

On December 16, 2024, at his first formal press conference since winning the election, Trump described Xi as a friend and “amazing guy,” suggesting the U.S. and China should work together to solve global problems. In the meantime, he vowed to make the U.S. rich with tariffs.
With less than one month to go, we don’t know if Trump will be able to make a deal with Xi. But if the president-elect is able to work out that many details in such a short period of time, he won’t need foreign leaders to add luster to his inauguration.

First signed by President Jimmy Carter and PRC leader Deng Xiaoping in 1979, the Agreement on Cooperation in Science and Technology (STA) is the oldest agreement between the United States and the People’s Republic of China (PRC). Why did Washington and Beijing renew the science pact now despite rising tensions?
The STA was last extended on June 27, 2018, during the first Trump administration, and it included amendments to address U.S. concerns about China’s approaches to technology and innovation practices. After the STA expired in August 2023, the U.S. and China extended the old pact two times and kept negotiating on science and technology (S&T) cooperation. Now the revised agreement is signed in the final days of Biden’s term, and it is believed the fact Trump is about to take office has accelerated the negotiation process.
On December 13, 2024, China and the U.S. signed a protocol to amend and extend the STA, and agreed to extend the Agreement for additional five years, effective from August 27, 2024.
This new pact is narrower in scope, covering only collaboration on basic science projects between departments and agencies of the two governments. Critical and emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence and semiconductors are off the table for collaboration. U.S. officials suggested permissible projects might include research on the weather, oceanography and geology, as well as collecting influenza and air-quality data. Unlike its predecessor, the pact covers only government-to-government collaboration. The extension added mechanisms to improve transparency, reciprocity in data sharing, intellectual property rights protection and creates a process for any violations of its terms.
Compared with 45 years ago, the U.S. has recognized that its relationship with China is now more symmetrical. “Cutting off ties with China would directly and negatively impact our own research, the work of our immediate colleagues, and the educational mission of our universities,” wrote Stanford University physicists Steven Kivelson and Peter Michelson in a letter to Biden and signed by more than 1,000 scholars in 2023.
Although we have not seen the full text of the new pact, it appears from what has been revealed that Beijing has made concession to have the new pact signed. While we can only see “Extension” in the headlines in China’s domestic news, “Amendment and Extension” is in the headlines of other media and the U.S. government announcement. The concessions were made because of Beijing’s deep suspicions about the next American administration. It is apparent that Beijing does not think it will get a better deal with the new Trump administration. Sure enough, some Republican lawmakers began to question the new pact as soon as the agreement was signed. Now the question becomes whether the next president will tear up the signed agreement.
The new pact provides a basis for collaboration on basic science projects, but the restrictions on core technologies and transparency clauses suggest that the two countries have not abated in the slightest degree of vigilance in their technological competition.
In short, the amendment and extension of STA is not only a manifestation of the willingness of the U.S. and China to cooperate, but also highlights their competition and vigilance in the field of S&T. Both countries are aware of the importance of S&T cooperation and the possibilities of cooperation under rising tensions. We hope that similar consensus and cooperation can be reached in more areas. After mutual deterrence and sanctions, the two sides still maintain rationality and space of negotiation.
