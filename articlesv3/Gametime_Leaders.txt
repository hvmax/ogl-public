### Gametime Leaders

25 May 2020|Coronavirus, Leadership, Leadership Development
Ben Horowitz, co-founder of venture capital firm, Andreesen Horowitz, wrote a blog post in 2011 about the “Peacetime CEO/Wartime CEO.” The post opens with two quotations, one from rapper Bushwick Bill and the other, arguably more familiar to students of leadership, fromThe Godfather. In the latter, Michael Corleone describes why he’s removing the crime family’s longtimeconsigliere, Tom Hagen, from that role: “You’re not a wartime consigliere. Things may get tough with the move we’re trying.”
Horowitz goes on to cite examples of both types of business leaders. At Google, Eric Schmidt was an effective peacetime leader, compared to then incumbent CEO Larry Page, “who seems to have determined that Google is moving into war.” Still in Silicon Valley, he points to Andy Grove at Intel (and his masterfulOnly the Paranoid Survive) and Steve Jobs at Apple (at least in particular historical moments) as wartime CEOs, and John Chambers at Cisco as a peacetime CEO. Horowitz then fleshes out the two types in a list of various contrasting attitudes, behaviors and personal, organizational, and market priorities.
Nearly a decade later, amidst the coronavirus crisis, columnist Andrew Hill wrote in theFinancial Timesarguing that, “Wartime CEOs are not the ideal leaders in this crisis.” Picking up on Horowitz’s distinction, Hill was partly addressing the contemporary penchant of political leaders to frame the pandemic through the language and metaphors of war. His substantive claim, though, was that “experienced and adaptable bosses are more effective than rigid commanders.” Collaboration, steadiness, and humility in acknowledging what they don’t know are among the “peacetime” traits that serve leaders (business and political alike) well when facing an unrelenting and uncertain circumstances that go beyond commercial competition.
Yet the pandemic also highlights an important change to the elegantly clear contrast Horowitz initially offered: after fewer than 10 years, amidst conditions that transcend markets, an important shift has occurred in the attitude and approach of many wartime leaders. While the traditional battler fending off existential crises still exists (and during pandemic moments may be particularly apposite), another type of wartime leader has also emerged. Re-cast in response to contemporary shape-shifting and network-based enemies, thistwenty-first century wartime leaderis agile and adaptive across multiple time-horizons and when coping with complex and varied threats simultaneously. General Stanley McChrystal describes this leader most fully, notably inTeam of Teams, drawing on his own experiences with US forces facing insurgents and terrorists in Afghanistan.
At the same time, another compelling leader is perhaps more common in everyday experience than the prominent CEOs who tend to be spotlighted in business cases and best-practice discussions. I refer to this figure as thegametime leader. They play, with targeted creativity and reactive objectives, to reinforce their positions in what they see as bounded markets or political realms (the “playing fields”). They seek near-term wins without a broad future vision beyond maintaining course through a general disruption. Oftentimes, the corrections they make or innovations they support emulate those of industry trailblazers. While allowing for incremental internal improvements, they exercise empathy and leverage conflict and others' competition tactically.
To speak ofgametimeleaders brings to mind coaching or managing of sports, like football or basketball, and other competitive games, like chess or poker. These are what author and speakerSimon Sinekrecently called “finite games.” They tend to be marked by fixed rules, set competitors and playing fields, boundaries of time or other endpoints, agreed-upon objectives, and a clear difference between winning and losing. While many different leadership styles exist in these games (autocratic, democratic, facilitative, etc.), most leaders nevertheless abide by the same general parameters. Those constraints on decision-making, effort and performance also apply to many gametime leaders in business and politics, who might be seen as slow, steady and, finally, average. (Sinek’s “infinite games,” in which competitors and rules can be changed, without a set endpoint or clear winner and losers, relate more directly to the conditions of twenty-first century wartime or possibly visionary peacetime leaders – as well as those rare few leaders, coaches or players, who transform how sports are played.)
Another word often associated with gametime also deserves some unpacking. Sinceplayrefers to a wide range of sensory, fantasy, construction and challenge behaviors, it could variously apply to nearly all leaders. Even a more targeted use of the word for business leadership and strategy can be associated with all four types here. For example, inPlaying to Win, P&G CEO A.G. Lafley and consultant Roger Martin emphasize the critical need for leaders to make a set of critical choices “that uniquely positions the firm in its industry so as to create sustainable advantage and superior value relative to the competition.” This decision-making begins with “an aspiration to win and a definition of what winning looks like” and then proceed to determining what business they are in and where they will play.
“Playing” also raises a further issue relevant to all four types of leadership: namelyrole playing.
Role playing is arguably an underappreciated aspect of leadership, which requires adopting different roles or personas both to succeed with multiple current responsibilities and stakeholders as well as to grow into managing new ones. In its very title, sociologist Erving Goffman’s classicThe Presentation of Self in Everyday Lifemade a crucial distinction. Despite replying on analogies between social interactions in life (or leadership) and in the theatre, Goffman insisted on using the word “presentation” rather than “performance.” Stanford’s Deborah Gruenfeld’s recent book,Acting with Power, is more explicit about the theatrical analogy and how leaders exercise power through “the roles they play in someone else’s story.” All to say that gametime leaders are not the only ones who play different roles, though theirs may be more reactive to circumstances and less consistent with their values over time.
Finally, it’s important to recognize that individuals in each of the four types can be more or less successful. While Horowitz holds up renowned tech giants to help illustrate the types, we can imagine other CEOs who embraced many of the same attitudes and behaviors he outlines but failed to win their own war or peace. The same contingency holds for the additional types I’m proposing. Gametime leaders may appear wedded to routine, to preserving their own position and maintaining their company’s mid-level status. Yet in some conditions, that relative slowness and conservatism may be fitting and prudent. Likewise, twenty-first century wartime leaders may seem to embody the aspirational qualities of many organizations today, but their very speed and agility may mean they over correct or lack the patience that is better-suited to certain organizations or markets. In more extreme terms, besides the respective successful examples, each type can also be marked by mediocrity and incompetence.
The following table summarizes many attributes of the four leadership types. It builds on the original contrasts sketched out by Horowitz. In fact, thewartimeandpeacetimecolumns quote his original words extensively (if in modified format).
