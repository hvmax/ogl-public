### China Restructuring State Council Departments

AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy and, in particular, life in China. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. In this post, we focus on the institutional restructuring of China's State Council, or cabinet. Under this reform, the State Council will consist of 26 commissions and ministries along with the General Office of the State Council.   Our view is that this restructuring strengthens China's ability to respond to country-wide events and global financial and geopolitical trends.

President Xi Jinping's restructuring of State Council commissions and agencies affects dozens of entities, and seeks to address current challenges facing not only China but other countries. Chief among the challenges is taking aim at breaking free of the technology blockage imposed by the United States, and also avoiding systemic financial catastrophes that are threatening the global banking system.
Observers might come away with the impression that the restructuring, the eighth since 1982, is "problem-focused" with a clear-cut target to accelerate scientific research and technological innovation, and ensure a more proactive and muscular management of financial services, natural resources, and foreign aid.
Ministry of Science
Chief among the changes was to the Ministry of Science and Technology, which has been reshuffled to work on the tasks of the "new whole-nation system" (新举国体制). In short, it will work to achieve innovation breakthroughs and rev up the macro-management functions relating to high-tech research and development. The “new” refers to the open platform and the market focus, compared to the "old" era with closed door hatchings.
The ministry, which will be managed by the newly created CPC body, the Central Science and Technology Commission, aims to "accelerate the realization of high-level scientific and technological self-reliance" in response to "the severe situation of international scientific and technological competition as well as external containment and suppression", according to a Cabinet document.
This structure allows the CPC to centralize its leadership role in setting the road map for China's comprehensive technology advances. With a "laser focus" on technology innovation, China could replicate what the country has achieved in the high-flying aerospace sector by pooling human and material resources and establishing the nation's advantage in near-Earth and deep-space exploration.
National Data Bureau
Also, a new National Data Bureau will be established to coordinate integrated sharing, development and use of China's massive data resources, while the China National Intellectual Property Administration will be elevated to a top-level agency directly under the State Council to ramp up the IPR protection.
"In today's society, digital resources and the digital economy play a fundamental role in economic and social development, and are of great significance for building a new development pattern, building a modern economic system, and building new advantages in the competition between nations," according to the plan establishing the new bureau.
National Financial Regulatory Administration
In another major area of the organizational reform plan, a National Financial Regulatory Administration will be set up to oversee the country's entire financial sector (except for the security market, which is overseen by the National Securities Regulatory Commission). The People's Bank, China's central bank, will be relieved from financial management issues and only concentrate on monetary policies, money supply, and inflation issues.
The new entity will shoulder the responsibility for overseeing all commercial banks, insurance companies, and other financial institutions. It is also tasked with detecting and preventing financial risks endangering the whole system – similar to those happening in the United States and Switzerland today.
The new financial regulatory body consolidates oversight, which analysts said was aimed at closing loopholes with multiple agencies monitoring different aspects of trillions of dollars' worth of its financial services industry, as well as clarifying unclear responsibilities and an absence of supervision at some points.
Additional Cabinet Changes
Along with creating the new financial regulatory agency, China will form a State Market Regulatory Administration to replace three agencies with overlapping oversight of food, drugs, consumer, and industrial products.
China will create the new Ministry of Natural Resources that will manage and develop natural resources, while the Ministry of Ecological Environment will enforce environmental protection policies. Climate change monitoring and response will shift from the National Development and Reform Commission to this new ministry.
Finally, China is creating an International Development Cooperation Agency, which will be responsible for some of the duties currently shared by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Commerce. The agency will focus on the strategic planning and coordination of foreign aid, including the Belt and Road Initiative.
