### Shanghai Art: From Ophelia to Impression Sunrise

23 August 2021|China, China history
AtOn Global Leadership, we value the insights of our colleagues in China and the personal reflections they have shared with us and you over the last two years. As China has reopened in the wake of the pandemic and the Delta variant, one of our colleagues took to the streets to join others in exalting art. This column reflects one of our boots-on-the-ground perspectives that illuminate the heart of China and its culture.
During a weekend when the typhoon "fireworks" were about to hit Shanghai— heavy rainfall that caused water, power, and Internet outages—I went to see the paintingOphelia(1851-1852, John Everett Millais), my second viewing at the new Museum of Art Pudong (MAP).
Due to COVID-19, international travel has been blocked for two years and visiting museums in Europe has long become a luxury. In the summer of 2021, a new round of COVID-19 outbreaks hit China and my planned vacation to Beijing had to be canceled. In such turbulent times, it's nice to enjoy the original work ofOpheliain my home city of Shanghai.
Ophelia is a character inHamletby William Shakespeare. When her father is murdered by her lover Hamlet, Ophelia is driven out of her mind and drowns after falling into a stream. The calm, drowning young lady is surrounded by lush, blooming nature. Millais has used his paintbrush to make Ophelia one of the most well-known images of Western art. Although it is my second time standing in front ofOphelia, I am still struck by its incredible beauty and delicate details, the flowers, the tree, and the rich and beaded dress.
MAP officially opened to the public on July 8, 2021.Opheliais the treasure of Tate Britain in London and the most noticeable painting in MAP’s first exhibit,Light: Works from Tate's Collection. It’s one of three inaugural exhibitions at MAP that will feature some of history’s most well-known artists.
Set in the waterfront area opposite Shanghai's Bund, the MAP is designed by French architect Jean Nouvel, whose portfolio includes the Louvre Abu Dhabi (2017), the Arab World Institute, Paris (1987), the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis (2006), and 100 11th Avenue, New York City (2010). Since its opening, the 13,000-square-meter museum has become a new landmark in Shanghai and has received much praise. Some netizens suggested that MAP has changed the landscape of art museums in Shanghai.
No matter who you are, you can always enjoy your time in MAP. Art lovers can study each artwork carefully, communicating with the artist through time and space. Like taking photos? MAP is the right place with its white interior, ubiquitous light, and epic location. The coffee shop downstairs and the observation deck overlooking the Huangpu River are ideal places for a date or meeting friends. The MAP is an invitation letter, giving everyone who is interested in art one more reason to come to Shanghai.
In September 2020, Claude Monet'sImpression Sunriseleft its home at the Musée Marmottan Monet in Paris for Shanghai. This was the first time this iconic Impressionist masterpiece had been exhibited in China since its appearance 148 years ago. Impression Sunrisewas able to come to Shanghai for two reasons: Musée Marmottan Monet was closed due to the pandemic, allowing a window in time to allow the masterpiece to travel; and Shanghai has the market, capital, and exhibition conditions for the world's top artworks.
Chinese art enthusiasts were able to observe the brushstrokes and colors in Monet's original works, and capture its beauty in the details. People were wishing Monet's "red sun" would bring hope to the world that is suffering the chaos of the pandemic. There are another 46 works on display withImpression Sunrise, including nine of Monet's oil paintings from the collection at the Musée Marmottan Monet. One can easily feel the heat ofImpression Sunrisefrom numerous images on social media.
In 2016, I went to the Musée Marmottan Monet in Paris to experience the sunrise up close. Marmottan is located in a quiet corner of Paris, with large woodlands nearby. We had to ask for directions two times before we finally found its location. The museum was quiet, and there were not many visitors. We were not allowed to take photos inside the museum. In Shanghai, people waited in lines to see the originalImpression Sunrisefor a higher ticket price (2).
Opheliareminds me of other Western art exhibitions held in Shanghai after the outbreak of COVID-19, such asImpression Sunriseat the Bund One Art Museum,The Shape of Time - Highlights of the Centre Pompidou Collectionat the West Bund Museum,Tadao Ando: Endeavorsat the Fosun Foundation (Shanghai), andVALENTINO RE-SIGNIFYat the Shanghai Power Station of Art. Although Chinese tourists cannot go abroad due to the pandemic, Western artworks have not stopped coming to China.
Although current US-China relations have encountered serious difficulties, the interest in Western culture in China has not declined. The Chinese people firmly believe that opening up to the outside world is the right path forward for China's further development. While we are still in a tough battle against COVID-19, the message conveyed in Monet'sImpression Sunriseexhibition seems to be more symbolic and relevant to our real world: humankind needs to break its isolation and resume international exchange. Sunrise brings light and hope, "let us lay aside the deeds of darkness and put on the armor of light." (3)
