### Sea Change: A Closer Look into What Happened to Alibaba

21 January 2021|China, China politics
AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy and, in particular, life in China. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. We have sought to advance a conversation about the U.S.-China relationship, and a deep understanding of local economic development in China. We have written series about the strategic strength oflocal economic development in China’s 2nd and 3rd tier cities,entrepreneurship in China today, andChina’s Belt and Road Initiative. More recently, we have focused onChina’s big tech economyand the companies that are changing Chinese society and the world. This post adds to that conversation. – The Editorial Team

On many fronts, 2020 was a harrowing year for individuals, organizations, and countries. The world was wracked by pandemic, economic collapse, social disruption, and geopolitical aftershocks. For the Chinese tech giant, Alibaba, the last two months of 2020 turned from harrowing to disastrous. The disaster dates to the abrupt suspension of the ANT Group IPO by the Chinese government on November 3. 2020.
In December, The Alibaba Group, the parent company of ANT Group, and its affiliates were subjected to a series of regulatory measures, which included an antitrust investigation and several administrative fines. Within two months, the company’s stock price fell 20%. Alibaba and ANT executives cried uncle in December, working with Chinese officials to “rectify” its many regulatory issues.
What happened to Alibaba suggests that Chinese Internet enterprises – represented at the forefront by Alibaba and Tencent – have entered a new stage of scrutiny by the Chinese government. They will no longer be able to stay under the protective umbrella of Internet or technology, outside of supervision from the Chinese government. The regulatory measure below tells a different story.
Looking back, the rapid development of China’s Internet platform and e-commerce economies has been largely driven by fierce competition in a relatively loose regulatory environment. Intense competition presses companies to use all means possible to suppress and eliminate opponents. “One out of two” (“二选一”) is one of the key methods used by e-commerce platforms to suppress opponents – the common parlance here is the proposition of a duopoly-based system (i.e., Alibaba and Tencent). However, even in China, this is an illegal act that abuses market dominance and restricts competition. For example, if a brand wants to enter Alibaba’s Tmall ecosystem, Tmall prohibits the brand from opening stores on its rivals JD (京东) or Pinduoduo (拼多多). Although “one out of two” is expressly prohibited by the Anti-Monopoly Law, the E-Commerce Law, and other regulations, few companies have been punished due to lax enforcement. Wang Shuai, Chairman of the Public Relations Committee of Alibaba, publicly stated in October 2019 that “one out of two” is normal market behavior, sort of good money drives out bad.
There is a long list of “one out of two” victims of Tmall including companies like Uniqlo and Pinduoduo, and many small and medium-sized brands. Other e-commerce platforms keep complaining about Alibaba’s monopoly, but they do not lose to Alibaba in launching “one out of two” in their dominant product categories such as JD in 3C or appliances. However, Alibaba is the only company that has publicly endorsed “one out of two” at the executive level.
Generally speaking, e-commerce companies have complicated business models. When they are subject to regulation of a particular industry, they often use the nature of Internet technology as an excuse to evade that regulation. E-commerce in China has been developing too rapidly for regulatory measures to keep abreast. What's more, to encourage the vitality of the e-commerce industry, regulatory enforcement did not reflect the law on paper. Therefore, Internet companies have had an easy time compared companies in other industries. For example, Huabei (花呗) launched by Ant in 2015 has some of the functions of a credit card, such as overdraft limit, interest-free period, repayment date, etc. Unlike bank credit cards, Huabei has not been approved by relevant authorities. China Zheshang Bank, which was also established in 2004 in Hangzhou as Alipay, had to wait 11 years to get approval for its credit card business.
One may ask why other companies have been reluctant to conduct regulatory arbitrage? One obvious answer is e-commerce has more radical risk takers. “Getting on the bus before buying tickets,” is how Internet platforms often grab business opportunities. Alibaba’s Jack Ma has said he was prepared to go to jail when launching Alipay. The deeper reason, however, has less to do with gutsy entrepreneurs but rather whether the government wants to support a particular industry or not.
In the eyes of the public, Alibaba has become more and more arrogant – at times it is seen as disrespecting regulators, at times disrespecting consumers. Before confronting China’s top financial regulators at the Shanghai Bund Summit in October 2020, Alibaba also publicly challenged State Administration for Industry and Commerce (SAIC) in 2015, the predecessor of the State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR). On January 23, 2015, the results of an online survey released by SAIC showed that Alibaba's retail platform Taobao had the lowest authenticity rate. On January 27, Taobao fiercely attacked the SAIC and named Liu Hongliang, the director of the Network Supervision Department of SAIC. Twenty-four hours later, SAIC counterattacked by publishing a “White Paper on Administrative Guidance to Alibaba Group,” which contained information Alibaba didn’t reveal in its IPO prospectus. Later that day, Taobao made a public complaint against SAIC, claiming that the supervision process had procedural improperness, poor investigation methods, and its conclusions were not objective.
The final outcome of this clash was a truce. SAIC stated that the white paper does not have legal effect, and Alibaba would cooperate with SAIC to vigorously fight against counterfeiting. The interpretation of the public was that SAIC had let Alibaba go. Once again, the supervision thunder rumbled loudly, but little rain fell. (Alibaba did pay a US$ 250 million to resolve the lawsuit of improper information disclosure due to the strict regulatory environment in the United States.) From 2015 to 2020, China's mega Internet platforms continued to advance, gaining greater economic influence and more control over social resources. COVID-19 in 2020 has further intensified this trend. By the end of 2020, Alibaba had become China’s most valuable company, a juggernaut crossing retail, financial services, media, entertainment, and cloud computing sectors.
Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC) in 2012, the direction of China’s national development has shifted from efficiency first (pro-business) to fairness first (ordinary people enjoying more economic development results). When the Internet giants are grabbing the business of vegetable stalls and threatened the livelihood of low-income people, a government that has turned to fairness first will naturally “strengthen anti-monopoly and prevent the disorderly expansion of capital,” a key task identified for 2021 in the CPC politburo meeting and the Central Economic Work Conference held in December 2020. The shift of the direction has turned from slogans to implementation.
Outside China, international medias seem to be even more pessimistic about Alibaba’s future, predicting a crackdown that will lead to its demise. Do Chinese authorities really want to bring down Alibaba? Of course not. There is no reason to “kill” the most successful and competitive company in China. China needs loyalty, control, and results and performance. Who can the Chinese government count on to compete with Amazon or Google? So, this is the logic of theandinstead of theor. If people don’t recognize theandlogic, they will not understand China today. If a company doesn't recognize theandlogic, it won't be able to understand its opportunities and boundaries. During the entire process of making Alibaba, Jack Ma has actually been surfing on the edge of regulation limits, riding theandrather than theor.
E-commerce in China has passed the period where it needs special care. The industry needs to be more coordinated with China's public interests rather than their own interests. The United States is encountering similar challenges with its Internet companies, which have benefited from their special regulatory status for more than two decades. Most Chinese Internet entrepreneurs believe, the essence of the Internet is monopoly and not competition. Though they also know that once a monopoly is formed, it will hinder competition, harm the rights of consumer, and harm fairness and innovation.
For foreign companies that want to advance in China, the regulation of Alibaba and other e-commerce giants is not necessarily a bad thing. At the end of 2020, China and the European Union signed the Comprehensive Agreement on Investment (CAI), which has at its core rules that ensure a clear, fair, and transparent investment environment with regulatory procedures and improved labor standards. In the e-commerce arena, companies such as Amazon, E-bay, Wal-Mart, and Uber have failed in China. One prominent complaint from these foreign companies is that China favored Chinese companies in terms of regulation and competition. How can foreign-invested Internet companies, which are required to comply with Chinese laws, compete with a Chinese company that is able to skate through employing a savvy regulatory arbitrage?
In the coming decades, while the US and China will maintain economic ties, there likely will be further decoupling in the fields of science and technology. Today, the favorites of the Chinese government are hardcore Chinese technology companies like Huawei and foreign companies like Apple and Tesla that are compliant and help bind China and the US together. In the context of US-China competition, while we need to understand the risks faced by the Chinese economy and Chinese companies, it is also prudent to not be too bearish. In the long run, the regulation of Alibaba at the end of 2020 may be remembered as a slap on the wrist and nothing more. If the past is instructive, consider that the conflict between Alibaba and SAIC in 2015 caused its stock to fall by almost 50% in eight months, but in the five years that followed Alibaba’s stock rose by 550%.
For many observers, one lingering question remains: Where is Jack Ma? He disappeared more than two months ago after speaking dismissively about China’s banking sector, which triggered the CPC’s ongoing battles with Ant and Alibaba. Many suspect Ma, who has the long view, might be practicing Tai Chi in a secluded temple somewhere. But we are sure to hear from him again.
