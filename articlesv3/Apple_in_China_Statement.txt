Statement Regarding the Upcoming Publication of
Apple in China: The Capture of the World's Greatest Company
I am aware of the publication of the forthcoming book,Apple in China: The Capture of the World's Greatest Company,authored byFinancial Timesjournalist Patrick McGee that discusses Apple and its various operations and activities in China over the last 25 years. I participated in interviews with the author, all of which are accurately quoted in the book, and I want to clarify the nature and scope of those conversations. I consider Mr. McGee to be a talented and hard-working journalist who has told a fascinating story about what I consider to be the world's most successful corporation.
In speaking with Mr. McGee, I provided my personal insights and context about my own experience as a China scholar, a corporate consultant helping firms understand China, and my personal experience as a senior director in China for Apple. I was Â clear from the outset that I would not disclose any proprietary information. I was not a source for any specific internal information that appears in the book, and I did not authorize or endorse any conclusions drawn therein that go beyond the scope of my personal experience.
Any content in the book that could be construed as critical or controversial regarding Apple should be understood as the independent work and interpretation of the author. I was not involved in the editorial decisions or fact-checking processes that shaped the final publication. Moreover, I did not have control over how my input was presented or combined with other sources.
I remain respectful of the work being done at Apple and the extraordinary colleagues I worked with while I was there. I take confidentiality seriously and have always strived to honor any legal and ethical obligations regarding sensitive information.
I hope this clarifies my role and dispels any misconceptions about the extent of my involvement.
