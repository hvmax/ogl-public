### China: Shenzhen’s Poisonous Fruit

11 May 2021|China, Economic Development
AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy and, in particular, life in China. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. We have sought to advance a conversation about the U.S.-China relationship, and a deep understanding of local economic development in China. We have been writing about the U.S.-China Trade War as it relates toChinese Innovation;entrepreneurship in China today;anda series aboutChina’s Belt and Road Initiative. More recently, we have focused on thestrategic strength oflocal economic development in China’s 2nd and 3rd tier citiesand a broader analysis of China’s leading cities and clusters of economic development. This post adds to that conversation. – The Editorial Team

AtOn Global Leadership, we have written extensively about the balance between the Central Government’s direction and the entrepreneurial autonomy given to localmunicipalitiesandregions. The City of Shenzhen is one of the amazing economic development stories of China’s Reform Era.
The most recent Beijing politburo meeting on April 30, 2021, raised a couple of interesting points with regarding the country’s hot issues. One is to reiterate curbs on the housing real estate hike, especially school district housing speculation. The other is a proposal to develop a local response to prevent and resolve economic and financial risks, and to establish a fiscal and financial risk disposal mechanism that would be led by area party and government leaders. Both issues fed into a recent political affair in Shenzhen.
Mayor Chen Rugui (Aug 2017-Apr 2021) resigned his position – without any obvious reasons – along with other key positions such as the chief of the education and health committee, the bureau chief of industrial and information, head of the People’s Court, head of the People’s Procuratorate, and the chief of the supervision committee. At 59, there is no requirement to retire from any of the posts—and no replacement was named.
The Chinese Communist Party norm is to always give a rationale for such resignations – a hint of demotion, announcing a future post, or just positioning individuals for other roles. If this is indeed some kind of “step down,” it sets a new precedent here for the party cadres to “take responsibility,” which is a positive change.
It has been speculated that Beijing lost confidence on the city’s handling on housing price hike. Or even worse, the city or the individuals were in cahoots with the developers to manipulate the market.
Shenzhen was a fishing village 40 years ago, before it was designated for a special reform and opening-up zone. It started as a duty-free processing zone, humbly eyeing on the other side of the border to be integrated into Hong Kong’s trade with the world.
In 2018, Shenzhen’s GDP surpassed that of Hong Kong, which has missed some windows in hi-tech and Internet era. Its weakness with its real estate-driven model neglected common prosperity, and the political turmoil there did not help. Therefore, according to many leaders in China, it is now up to Shenzhen to aim beyond.
In 2019, Beijing unveiled a blueprint to turn Shenzhen to a “pilot demonstration area for socialism with Chinese characteristics” (中国特色社会主义先行示范区), which would see this Chinese hi-tech hub becoming a world leader in economy, livelihood, technology and innovation, public services, and sustainability by 2025. The plan outlined wide-ranging reforms to be implemented in Shenzhen, including in the legal, financial, technological, institutional and social sectors.
Home to some of China’s biggest tech firms including telecommunications giant Huawei, drone maker DJI, the Internet conglomerate Tencent, and iPhone manufacturer Foxconn, the city is facing a double whammy from trade sanctions from the US and the economic impact of COVID-19. Theever-rising property pricesare quickly eroding its competitiveness. But Shenzhen is a showcase for the CPC to the world. Unlike Shanghai, which has too much historical burden, CPC built and made Shenzhen in 40 years practically from a blank sheet of paper.
The former mayor didn’t take it seriously, at least not seriously enough. The priority was to tame the city’s soaring house prices, which have seriously harmed its ability to attract domestic and global talent.

Home prices in China’s megacities, including Shenzhen, have surged significantly since last year due to rising demand and market speculation, prompting the central government to step up its efforts to drive speculators out of the market. Xi has said on different occasions that “housing is for living in, not for speculation” (房住不炒). But Shenzhen was not able to curb speculation in the property market.
Among China’s Tier-One and Tier-Two cities, most of them implemented housing purchase controls. One must be qualified to buy regardless of whether you have the resources or not, regardless of whether you have lined up financing or not. Typically one has to be employed in the city for more than a certain period of time, has been paying into the city’s social welfare requirements, and has no prior ownership of housing, etc. Under these circumstances, an individual will be allowed to purchase property.
Some have tried to game the system. Recently, there was a blogging celebrity, “Shen Fang li” (real name: Li Xuefeng), who created some pseudo REITs for speculating in the housing market. The followers and fans in the online groups taught each other to avoid regulations and supervision for private financing, funding through P2P, contracting entrustment, etc. to make it securitized for small-pooled investors. If the trend continues, the city will quickly hollow out.
The latest reshuffle in the Shenzhen government shows: either (1) the officials did not spot the potential, or (2) they weren’t strategically in line with the bigger plan for which Beijing had expected of them.
Knowing how much Hong Kong has been hurt by its property prices and imbalance, and the stagnation in economic development it caused, it seems to be the view of the Beijing government that Shenzhen should be set up to benchmark against Singapore, where  affordable public housing is owned by 80% of residents.
With the important role it plays, Shenzhen stands a good chance to resolve its problems. We expect to see innovation in social systems and governance. More efforts will be made to improve work in land management, carrying out pilot programs in the capital market, the transformation of technological achievements and accelerating the development of the data market.
We have written previously about “local governments as industrial firms” (a framing we borrowed from the great China scholar, Stanford Professor Andrew Walder). We have argued that local leaders are given a significant amount of autonomy to run their jurisdictions, but they are also held accountable for outcomes that align with the plans that come out of Beijing. Just like corporate executives, they have Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that link to Beijing’s vision. In the case of Shenzhen, the message might be: the leadership was not getting the job done, at least not in alignment with Beijing's vision of Shenzhen’s role in the region; and it is time to move on.
