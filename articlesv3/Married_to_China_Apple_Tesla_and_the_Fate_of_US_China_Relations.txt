### Married to China: Apple, Tesla and the Fate of US-China Relations

AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy and, in particular, life in China. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. We have written about economic development in China and China’s economic reforms, U.S.-China relations, China’s changing role in the global political economy, and the history and current state of Chinese politics. In this post, we weave together several strands that have converged to bring US-China relations to a state that we have not seen in many years. China’s emergence as a global deal broker and the growing tensions over Taiwan stand to have dramatic consequences for how the world’s two largest economies and the world’s two largest trading partners will interact for years to come with potentially dire consequences for the global economy as a whole. These issues are important and broad, as they stretch across the disciplines of manufacturing, global supply chains and global markets, and social media and technology. To keep our discussion focused, we look at two companies that have deep ties to both countries, Apple and Tesla. We have written and spoken about these issues previously (see, e.g.,hereandhere), and we continue that conversation here.

The New York Timescolumnist Thomas Friedman recently wrote about his first return to China since the pandemic began (here). In his eloquent article, he made many salient points. Among the points, he argued that, at a time when our economies are more intertwined and interdependent than ever, we have reached a state of distrust that is deeper than any we have seen in several decades. “The new, new thing has a lot to do with the increasingly important role that trust, and its absence, plays in international relations, now that so many goods and services that the United States and China sell to one another are digital, and therefore dual use — meaning they can be both a weapon and a tool. Just when trust has become more important than ever between the U.S. and China, it also has become scarcer than ever.”
But we are not just dealing with trust, the digital economy, and manufacturing alone. We are also dealing with U.S.-China relations in the shadow of U.S.-NATO relations and China’s growing role in the Middle East. The fact that China’s President Xi brokered the Saudi Arabia-Iran deal a few months ago and that French President Emmanuel Macron visited Xi in China last month has meant that China is rising as a global influencer.
These are trying times for the U.S. hegemony – and maybe that is a good thing. Just to be clear, there will be serious economic consequences if China and the United States continue down this contentious path. Our view is that the consequences are probably greater for the United States economy than for China. China is heavily dependent on foreign investment to create jobs but also for partnership in building industrial clusters in the manufacturing supply chain.
U.S. companies are heavily dependent on China for production of many products that are exported back to the United States and around the world. The profitability of U.S. companies is fundamentally tied to their Chinese production processes. Inasmuch as the strength of the U.S. economy is largely tied to the innovation and performance of technological powerhouses such as Apple and Tesla, those companies cannot produce their products at scale without the well-oiled manufacturing supply chain that exists in China. Thus, the United States faces serious risk of economic crisis if the frostiness between our nations continues.
So why is China so important for companies like Apple and Tesla? Most observers assume it is because China’s 1.4 billion consumers. For these companies, the Chinese market is indeed important (for each of these companies, China is their second largest market behind the United States for their products). But it is about much more than access to the Chinese market; it is about access to the Chinese manufacturing supply chain.
Other observers assume that China’s importance lies in the deep cheap labor pool that resides there. However, the situation is much more complex than the presence of a large low-cost labor force. It is about China’s superior manufacturing supply chain, a system that cannot be reproduced in other countries by Foxconn simply building a final assembly factory there (e.g., India).
Here is a favorite statistic: Apple controls about 30% of the smartphone market in the world (in other words, of all of the individuals in the world using smartphones, 1/3 are using iPhones); however, about 90% of the profits in this market flow to Apple. That is not a typo – one-third of smartphone owners in the world are texting with iPhones, and Apple takes 90% of the profits in this market segment. How can this be? While many observers believe the answer lies in superior products and premium pricing, this is not correct. The answer to the puzzle is China. China – and Apple’s organizational structure in China – is the reason Apple is the most profitable company in the world.
Apple entered China in 2001 under the guidance of then Chief Operating Officer, Tim Cook. Today, Apple works with over 1,500 suppliers in China, suppliers that build components, assemble modules, and conduct final assembly. The company is able to engage with each of these suppliers, force them to compete against each other for Apple business, which drives production prices down. The benefit to the Chinese suppliers is that they learn efficient supply chain management from Apple’s operations engineers, who work closely with them throughout the process. These suppliers then turn around and charge much higher prices to Apple’s competitors – Huawei, Samsung, Ericsson, Xiaomi, Oppo, Vivo, etc. Apple eschewed the standard business model of the time – the Joint Venture – and instead focused on building partnerships and teaching efficient operations and production to many different suppliers. Soon, many suppliers – producers of components, modules, final assembly – were all competing for Apple’s time and attention, all seeking the opportunity to learn for Apple’s brilliant operations engineers.
This process and value that Apple brings to the table – the knowledge of how to run an efficient supply line – is what management scholars and accountants call tacit knowledge. There is no explicit technology transfer tied to the relationships Apple has built with its Chinese suppliers, but the suppliers benefit tremendously through deep collaboration with Apple’s operations engineers. Whether the collaboration is with Foxconn for efficient final assembly or Lens for efficient production of touchscreen glass, Apple engineers work tirelessly in helping the line managers of these suppliers organize the world’s best production processes. And Chinese suppliers are willing to work with Apple for near-zero margins in the profit column, as they then carry that tacit knowledge to their work with the rest of the industry. It is a good deal for the Chinese suppliers, as they carry forward the building of the most sophisticated and efficient industrial clusters in the world around a given set of components and modules. And it is a GREAT deal for Apple, which has paid off, making Apple the most profitable and most valuable company in the world.
As it turns out, the genius behind Apple’s prowess as one of the world’s most powerful companies was not the creative product ingenuity of founder Steve Jobs; at least as much credit goes to the operations ingenuity of Jobs’ successor Tim Cook. But the key point is this: without China, Apple’s profitability becomes a lot more pedestrian. In a recentFinancial Timesarticle, Jay Newman wrote, “Apple will likely never be able to completely exit China. Even small shifts risk retaliation by Chinese overlords… Will China – which has contributed hugely to Apple’s success – allow it to slink away? Why would they? These are problems Apple made: for the foreseeable future, Apple has no choice but to do what China wants.” (This article alsoreferences expertisethat was brought to the table by OGL years ago.)
Tesla’s case is similar to Apple’s, though the risk for Tesla is perhaps even more extreme. China has been vigorously promoting the use of new energy vehicles in recent years. It is the general trend for vehicles to shift from ICE to NEV. In recent years, China has become the world's largest automobile market and NEV market in a high growth of 30% - 50% every year. Shanghai gave the most favorable land price. Tesla meanwhile was also struggling to find its own foothold.
Tesla entered China in 2019, with great fanfare and a giga-factory in Shanghai’s Lingang Free Trade Zone. The local government did its best to match Tesla's needs, and Tesla grasped this life-saving straw, a hedging for both to win on their part. Tesla needs production, and Shanghai wants an industry. Tesla got a low favorable interest rate, as low as 3.9%, which has made many domestic enterprises envious. China Merchants Bank provided Tesla with a large loan of 5 billion yuan. Note that it is an unsecured loan agreement, although we all know that the whole Shanghai government is behind it.
There was much buzz about this deal because Tesla was allowed to enter China as a Wholly Owned Foreign Enterprise (WOFE) in an industry where Chinese-Foreign Equity Joint Ventures are the standard model for operation. Tesla was allowed to proceed with its model, and we can be sure many promises were made about the company’s reliance upon and improvements to China’s manufacturing supply chain in this important market segment.
During the building of the facility, the Shanghai mayor and vice mayor had championed Tesla for problem solving and project progress, and the relationship has only deepened from there. Just last month, Tesla announced plans to build a new megapack battery factory – also in Lingang – deepening its partnership with and dependence on China. Asreportedby Yashwardhan Jain, “Tesla aims to take advantage of China’s world-leading battery supply chain to increase its output and reduce costs of its lithium-ion battery units of megapack.”
From the laying of the foundation in 2019 to when the first Model 3 rolled off the assembly line in Tesla Shanghai Giga Factory in January 2020, only a year had passed. The fact that it only took a year for this process to unfold is a remarkable achievement and testament to the efficiency of China’s manufacturing supply chain, and the desire from both parties to succeed.
In 2023, Tesla’s turnover is estimated to reach 100-billion-yuan level, which will drive a large industrial cluster or eco-system in Shanghai. In September 2019, the Lingang Industrial Park next to the Shanghai Tesla plant signed 24 key projects, ranging from smart networks to new energy vehicle parts, with an initial amount of nearly 8-billion-yuan investment, including manufacturing, applications, service and functional platforms.
At present, Shanghai Tesla has hundreds of suppliers in China. The supplied components include batteries and connectors, PCB and FPC (flexible circuits), various sensors, heat dissipation components, metallurgical process, wire harness, charging pile, rare earth materials, gearbox and so on.
While it builds a high-quality supply chain and greater capacity, China's benefits from the relationship will be many. More enterprises will have the opportunity to integrate with first-class global R&D and manufacturing, and there will be spillover to other domestic EV automakers. Finally, it will result in positive feedback for the whole NEV industry and form and reinforce a dynamic EV industry and market in China.
Since Tesla entered China’s new energy vehicle market, the whole pattern of China's auto market has been disrupted and reshaped. The parts localization effort has formed a strong supply chain and value chain around Tesla. It also benefitted the domestic NEV enterprises which were spoon fed little by little by government subsidies. So, the introduction of Tesla in Lingang is not only meaningful to Shanghai, but also good for the whole Chinese auto market. The recent EV export hype has testified to this.
The reason Tesla’s risk is even greater than Apple’s is that Tesla’s tie to China is literally built into the foundations of its two large factories. Even while the Tesla has maintained special status with the ownership structure of its China factories, the company is not going anywhere. Apple, on the other hand, can do a lot of handwaving – and it is just that, handwaving – about diversifying production across East and Southeast Asia, and if the company wanted to do that, it could. It would just no longer be the most profitable company in the world. In the end, both companies – alongside many others – are married to China.
So, whose side are the major economic players of the world on? Many influential voices wonder about this openly. As Michael Schuman recentlywroteinThe Atlantic, reporting on a factory visit by the Chinese Ambassador to the United States, Qin Gang, “The U.S. and China have become bare-knuckled economic competitors, especially in tech-rich industries such as electric vehicles, but here was Musk, one of America’s most innovative business leaders, fawning before a representative of the Chinese Communist Party. Whose side is Musk on, anyway… Musk may have founded the world’s most important electric-vehicle company in the fertile entrepreneurial soil of the United States, but its future relies as much on China as it does on its home country.” Others have been openly critical of Apple’s apparent hypocrisy, where Cook is lauded as a corporate hero and speaks glowingly about the company’s deep “symbiotic” relationship with China. This view on Apple is not new: see,for example, FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr, calling out Cook’s hypocrisy, as he waxes eloquent on the company’s stance on privacy and user’s rights, saying bluntly that Cook’s words and posturing “founder on the harsh reality of Apple’s conduct in China.”
Optics aside, the substantive issue here for both Apple and Tesla is that China’s manufacturing supply chain is far superior to any other in the world. This is especially true in technologically intensive sectors. China has spent the last four decades building sophisticated industrial clusters spread throughout the country (see, e.g., OGL analyseshere,here,here). The technological prowess of these industrial clusters has been derived from working with foreign partners such as Volkswagen, General Motors, Tesla, Samsung, Apple and many others. They have been seamlessly integrated by an infrastructure that was built to swiftly move components and modules around the country. And they are serviced by a well-educated force of technical engineers and a migrant labor force of some 350 million workers (the so-called “floating population”). There is no place in the world that can replicate this system, and there will not be for decades to come.
One of the frustrating questions we often get from reporters asking questions about foreign companies’ dependence on China goes something like this: “Why is Apple so dependent on China? Now that Foxconn has built a factory in India, can’t the company just move production to India?” This question (and others like it) show a very shallow understanding of how sophisticated manufacturing supply chains work. Yes, it is true that Foxconn is one of Apple’s supply chain partners. But Foxconn is only final assembly of products. As we’ve just detailed, the supply chain is more complex, and final assembly isn’t where the opportunity for innovation and profit are located. Quite simply, Apple and now Tesla are not leaving China any time soon.
When we think about U.S.-China relations, many issues come to the fore. We think about our relationship with the world’s second largest economy (and our largest trading partner). We think about China’s growing role in the South China Sea and its growing influence in Africa and the Middle East. But China’s real strength domestically is serving as the world’s most sophisticated manufacturing supply chain. And companies like Apple and Tesla are trapped there for the foreseeable future. After all, if you believe Jay Newman,Apple is a Chinese Company, according to his latest article. And maybe Tesla is on the way to that same designation.
Bottom line: we need to think carefully about the tensions dominating U.S.-China relations. There are many issues to think about from Taiwan to the South China Sea to the Middle East. But powerful U.S. companies and the U.S. economy itself are also at stake. There is still time to bring back the Era of Engagement, and we should.
