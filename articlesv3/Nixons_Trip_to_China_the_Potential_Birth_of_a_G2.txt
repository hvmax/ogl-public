### Nixon’s Trip to China & the Potential Birth of a G2

25 February 2022|China, China history, China politics, US-China Relations
AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy and, in particular, life in China. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. We have also written about thestrategy and logic of local economic development in China’s reform era. We have also written about thehistoryandcurrent stateof US-China relations. This post recognizes the 50th anniversary of  President Nixon's visit to China and how U.S.-China relations have evolved over that period.
By The On Global Leadership Team
Five decades ago, the United States was a global power and China’s economy was in deep crisis and its society was struggling under the weight of the Cultural Revolution. Today, China and the United States are the two largest economies in the world, economies that have become deeply intertwined since the diplomatic opening (经济开放) that began in 1979 under the leadership of Deng Xiaoping.
We have written extensively in past OGL posts about China’s decline from its position as the most powerful nation in the world (by far) in the 15th and 16th centuries to, ultimately, the Century of Humiliation at the hands of the West and Japan (see, e.g.,here).
As international pundits think about global and economic political influence today – as well as interdependent economies – there is a tendency to go too broad. The spheres of economic and political influence have been cast widely, if not always fairly. An example is the formation of the small click of powerful nations that get a “seat” at the G7 (or G8) table, but ignore emerging powerhouses like China and India - two massive economies and populations that cannot be ignored. Tossing them a bone, the G8 created the G20, a kids’ table of sorts, despite the fact that China was the third largest economy in the world at the time. It's no wonder President Xi aspires to finally returning to the summit of global power and restoring China to its “rightful” position as one of theif not themost powerful nation in the world (here).
Our view is that we should really be talking today not about a G7 (or G8 or G20) but rather about a G2: The United States and China. Full stop. The arguments for a binary option seem even more necessary today than in the past given economic and political trends. So, on this historic anniversary, let’s go back in time to see how we have gotten to this point in geopolitics and economic influence.
Laying the Groundwork for a G2
From February 21-28, 1972, U.S. President Richard Nixon visited China. It was “a week that changed the world.” At the end of Nixon’s visit, China and the United States issued a joint statement known as the Shanghai Communiqué, a historic success that opened the door to unprecedented peace and development to Asia and an elbowing out of the Soviet Union from a new club on the block.
Fifty years on, the world has been transformed from what it was in those early days:
The U.S. remains a superpower but its position has been eclipsed in recent years by political, trade and economic disputes;The Soviet Union, now Russia, is struggling to remain relevant beyond its cyber warfare and natural resources, or its military might as we're seeing in Ukraine;And China is an economic superpower that threatens the United States' position has the dominant global power, both economically and politically.
• The U.S. remains a superpower but its position has been eclipsed in recent years by political, trade and economic disputes;
• The Soviet Union, now Russia, is struggling to remain relevant beyond its cyber warfare and natural resources, or its military might as we're seeing in Ukraine;
• And China is an economic superpower that threatens the United States' position has the dominant global power, both economically and politically.
Today, the U.S.-China relationship is even more critical than it was half a century ago. Given their complex bilateral diplomacy, we firmly believe that the United States and China should seek coexistence and cooperation, because only in this way can we ensure peace and prosperity for these two ideological sides of the world.
Setting the Stage for Diplomatic Relations
The breaking of estrangement 50 years ago was no simple negotiation. It was actually one marked by any number of diplomatic twists and turns, overshadowed by a painful past and bruised egos and ignorance. After the founding of the People’s Republic of China (PRC) in 1949, China and the U.S. clashed for 20 years, including two military conflicts, the Korean War and the Vietnam War. During this time, China regarded America as its No. 1 enemy, and the U.S. blockaded China strictly and regularly. What eventually cracked the ice between the two countries was their shared opposition to Soviet hegemony. (An irony of sorts today.)
Behind the scenes of handshaking, banquets, and sightseeing that ordinary Americans saw on TV, Nixon’s visit to China was far from smooth. Mao Tse-tung barely met Nixon, as he had been seriously ill. Eventually, when Mao and Nixon were discussing “Philosophy” in Mao’s study, anxious doctors and nurses next door were preparing to rescue Mao at any time. The text of the joint communiqué, a result of days of negotiation and approved by Nixon and Mao, was subject to dozens of revisions, many proposed by the U.S. State Department, making it almost impossible for the two sides to publish on the last day of the visit. But somehow, the two parties reached a consensus during the visit, and opened the door to the normalization of formal diplomatic relations.
Since the mid-19th century, China has been striving for modernization, but the real breakthrough was achieved several years later after Nixon had been forced from office. It came with the ascension of Deng Xiaoping to power in 1978. For China, the establishment of diplomatic relations with the U.S. directly coincided with reforms and an opening up that were happening almost simultaneously.
Deng's rise built on the warming relations between the two countries, of course. But it was aided by traditional diplomacy. On December 16, 1978, China and the United States issued a joint communiqué to establish diplomatic relations. On January 1, 1979, the PRC and the U.S. formally established diplomatic relations with the Joint Communique of the United States of America and the People’s Republic of China (Normalization Communique).
With different geopolitical considerations than Mao Tse-tung and Chou En-lai, Deng saw relations with America as an essential part of China’s development roadmap. Deng understood that a stable and positive Sino-U.S. relationship as the primary external condition for China’s modernization. It is something Xi understands as well.
Based on GDP data from the World Bank, the U.S. has long been the largest economy in the world. Countries once ranked second, like the Soviet Union, Japan, and, Germany, which tops the European Union, have seen the gap widening year after year. Only China has been steadily closing the gap and, by our predictions, will likely overtake the United States as the largest economy in the world in 2028. With growing economic strength, China can spend much more on military and technology, and has gained more influence regionally and globally.
The Trump administration saw China as a threat, and the Biden administration defines China as the only competitor potentially to challenge to the U.S. in all domains. Now, Henry Kissinger’s power balance theory seems out of date and he himself is described as an “agent of Chinese influence” (1). Although Chinese leaders kept saying that the Pacific Ocean is big enough to accommodate both China and the U.S., for those who never forget the Cold War, the earth is too small for two superpowers.
Containment and Victimhood
There is a common understanding in China that the new containment began in 2011 – after China’s GDP surpassed Japan to become the second largest economy in the world. From 2011 to 2016, President Barack Obama vigorously pursued the policy of strategic rebalancing in Asia, with an underlying goal to prevent China from becoming the dominant power in the Asia–Pacific region.
The Chinese were shocked by Obama’s words in an interview on April 14, 2010, during which he said “if over a billion Chinese citizens have the same living patterns as Australians and Americans do right now then all of us are in for a very miserable time, the planet just can’t sustain it…” (2). These words are frequently quoted on Chinese social media as the underlining logic of the Western countries who don’t like China’s development, and, furthermore, are ignorant that the context of the talk was about a sustainable economic growth model.
Thomas Friedman, who has long heralded globalization, made it more straightforward: Americans could accept “shallow goods” like shirts, tennis shoes or solar panels from China, but not “deep goods” like software and computers because “shared values matter and they are not there.” (3) Ordinary Chinese people worry about these viewpoints.
Meanwhile, there are many books by American scholars predicting a conflict between China and the U.S. These include such widely-cited titles asDestined for War: Can America and China Escape Thucydides’s Trap?by Graham Allison,The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Orderby Samuel P. Huntington,The Tragedy of Great Power Politicsby John J. Mearsheimer. With five editions,The Tragedy of Great Power Politicsis now a classic in China.
All of these books (and may others) have been translated and published in China, and a wide swath of Chinese citizens are actually quite aware of the arguments laid out in these books. Mearsheimer believes that the rise of China will inevitably threaten America’s hegemony in Asia, because any rising country will be contained by the United States. According to Mearsheimer, China would not be an exception, and it has nothing to do with ideology. He further argues that traditional Confucian culture is not a guarantee for China’s peaceful rise.
Reinforced by the helplessness over the inevitable decline of Sino-U.S. relations, Mearsheimer’s fatalistic view is highly valued by Chinese scholars. One major concern of the outside world about China is "Why do Chinese people have such a strong victim mentality?" Here we try to answer this question from historical and cultural perspectives:
The Great Unity(大一统): The Chinese people have believed in the "Great Unity" from ancient times, China has unified its character, its calendar, and even its time. (China has only one time zone.) The opposite of unity is division. For ordinary people, a divided country means social unrest, wars, and poor livelihood. The most important legitimacy of the Chinese government comes from maintaining nation’s unity. Because of Taiwan, the country is still not united as the second largest economy of the world. The emphasis of the Chinese on territorial sovereignty far exceeds what Western countries can imagine.Know when to stop(适可而止): The Chinese have  maintained a theory that when the development of anything pushes to one extreme, a reversion to the other extreme takes place. This is the main thesis of Taoism and theBook of Changesalso adopted by Confucianism. So “Do not overdo something”, “Never too much” or “Know when to stop” have been the maxim of the Chinese. As the civilization experienced ups and downs in its 5,000-year history, the Chinese believe their rejuvenation is a natural cycle. The goal for national rejuvenation is set at its per capita GDP will reach half that of the U.S. by 2049, meaning while China is a wealthy country with the largest economy, America still remains the richest and most advanced country. Similarly, the Chinese expect the U.S. will find a way tonotover contain China.The century of humiliation is the term used in China to describe the period of interference and subjugation of China by Western powers and Japan from 1839 to 1949. Current policies and nationalism in China all have their roots in past encounters with the West, and it’s hard not to over-emphasize their impact on present day China. Perhaps only when China reaches national reunification and national rejuvenation, can their concerns be eased.

China and the U.S. in Competition
Entering 2022, the positive reviews on China by the U.S. government have come to an end. The Trump administration had characterized China as the top “strategic competitor” with the U.S., claiming that the policy of engagement with China over the past few decades had failed. The Biden administration has not changed the policies on China of the Trump administration, with Kurt Campbell boldly announcing the end of the engagement era. Mearsheimer is the wise man, as he perfectly predicted the policy shift of the U.S. government.
However, Mearsheimer did not predict the consequences of a U.S.-China conflict, especially military conflict. After 1949, China participated in more wars in its weak period than when it has become stronger. China has not been involved in any military conflict since the1990s. But this does not mean that China will not take military action when it believes its core interests are violated, especially on the Taiwan issue. The U.S. and China are both nuclear powers. If nuclear weapons prevented the U.S. and the Soviet Union from going into war directly, they will probably prevent direct military confrontation between China and America as well. ”Which leader who entered World War I so insouciantly in 1914 would not have recoiled had he been able to imagine the world at its end in 1918?" said Henry A. Kissinger in “China: Containment Won’t Work”. (4)
What will happen when the two countries engage in a fierce competition in trade and technology? The world’s two largest economies have been in a U.S.-orchestrated trade war since 2018, worsened by the sanctions on Chinese technology company Huawei and placing an additional 900 Chinese companies on the “entity list”. While Americans generally support a tough stance on China, few back severing economic ties between the two countries. As a response to the pressure, China has been seeking an even bolder approach by adopting its own form of decoupling, i.e., developing de-Americanized technologies and relying more on internal growth than exports alone. China is unwilling to slow its growth and the U.S. cannot stop obsessing over China’s growth. It has sparked a general unease among U.S. politicians who worry that China will soon eclipse the U.S.
To solve this dilemma, we can still learn from Nixon’s risky but successful trip to China. In the Shanghai Communiqué, there were fewer words to describe what the two sides had in common than their respective views. However, it was the commonalities that brought the two countries together. As a result, the U.S. won the Cold War and China developed into a modern industrial economy. The first two principles of international relations are something the two sides agreed upon：
Progress toward the normalization of relations between China and the United States is in the interest of all countries.Both sides wish to reduce the danger of international military conflict.
• Progress toward the normalization of relations between China and the United States is in the interest of all countries.
• Both sides wish to reduce the danger of international military conflict.
The most significant contribution made by the leaders of America and China five decades ago was “their willingness to raise their sight beyond the immediate issues of the day," said Kissinger. (5) It is because of their wisdom and courage that the two countries “have demonstrated that nations with very deep and fundamental differences can learn to discuss those differences calmly, rationally and frankly, without compromising their principles," according to Nixon. (6)
Half a century on, the Nixon-to-China moment is still remembered, studied, and admired because it was a new model that reflected the politics of a new era. The United States is a great nation; China is a great nation. To quote Kissinger, two great peoples “could merge their efforts not to shake the world, but to build it.” (7) We still have that hope. In today’s global landscape, the G7 is an antiquated notion, firmly rooted in the 1940s and not reflecting today's reality. We believe the first step in addressing everything from trade to climate change is to adopt the G2 approach. Once again, a new model for a new era.
