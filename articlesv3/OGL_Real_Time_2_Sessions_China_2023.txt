On Global Leadership's regular feature, OGL Real Time, presents our up-to-the-minute insights on current news and events. We hope these breaking news insights from our OGL team members will help illuminate the events of the day and provide the depth needed to understand global political, economic and cultural transitions and transformations. China holds two major meetings, the National People’s Congress (NPC) and the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) annually, and they are known as the "2 sessions."  This Real Time Q&A seeks to explain the 2 sessions. and what their activities and decisions could mean for China, its people and geopolitics.
Explain in layperson's terms what the 2 sessions are, and whether Chinese citizens pay close attention to what happens there?
To understand how ordinary people view the 2 sessions, it's important to clarify what the 2 sessions exist in China's overall governance structure. China is ruled by the Chinese Communist Party (CPC), which exercises leadership over all areas in China today. Xi Jinping holds the nation's paramount leadership position as the CCP general secretary.
Every five years, he National Congress of the CPC announces new promotions and appointments, including the party leader, assesses the party’s progress, and outlines the direction of the nation. The last congress was held in October 2022, and Xi was appointed for an unprecedented third term as leader.

China's national strategy and important personnel decisions are all made at the plenary session of the Party Central Committee, which is held before the 2 sessions. The Central Committee is comprised of China’s most recognized leaders representing provincial government, military, state-owned enterprises (SOEs), and party interests.
The 2 sessions reflect the work of two different bodies: the National People’s Congress (NPC) and the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), which hold their annual meetings at the same time but separately. The CPPCC is an advisory body, and the NPC is the CPC’s legislative body.
During the 2 sessions, the CPC's policy is implemented and the new leadership of the state and government are approved. Delegates also discuss issues that are important to ordinary people, such as employment, education, medical care, and science and technology.
The prime minister's press conference on NPC's closing day has been the hottest event during the congress because the premier answers questions raised by reporters on site and the event is broadcast live by CCTV. Issues of concern at this year's press conference include China's economic projections, how to expand domestic demand, the situation in the Taiwan Strait, China-U.S. relations, the war in Ukraine, and  the new prime minister's self-assessment. As an aside, it's also interesting to see which members of the foreign media get the opportunity to ask questions.
Is there a significant amount of chatter on social media in anticipation of the 2 sessions? If so, what is the nature of that chatter?
Every year during the 2 sessions, there are ideas and suggestions that become hot topics on social media. Often, they reflect people's everyday lives and concerns, catching the attention of and stirring up debates among netizens, but they don't necessarily pop up during conference discussions. Here are a few such topics for 2023:
Flat-rate payments for social insurance and the housing fund for enterprise employees, regardless of their income. Right now the statutory social welfare insurance and fund are based on one's payroll.Lift the requirement that parents have no criminal records, one of the restrictions on the civil servants entry examination.Change the compulsory foreign language test in the national college entrance examination to an optional selection, and abolish the English language as one of the main subjects in junior high school and high school.Entitle private cars a certain number of days travel on highways for free.Adjust and alter people's days off on the weekends to create more opportunity for long weekends.

This will be the first meeting since the Government ended its COVID-19 restrictions, which were in place for three years. It will also occur in the wake of China’s (somewhat) disappointing GDP results for 2022. What do you expect the major areas of focus will be at the 2 sessions?
Retiring Chinese Premier Li Keqiang.
Retiring Chinese Premier Li Keqiang.
On March 5, retiring Premier Li Keqiang delivered his last government work report, and the most notable point of the report set China's GDP growth rate at 5% for 2023. Due to relaxing COVID-19 control measures last year, a major obstacle to economic development has been removed. More than half of China's provinces have set their 2023 GDP growth targets at 6% or above, and analysts generally expected Chinese leaders to set a GDP target of 5% or higher. So why does Beijing set such a conservative goal：
First, the Beijing is not very optimistic about this year's development environment: ”Our country has entered a period of development in which strategic opportunities, risks, and challenges are concurrent and uncertainties and unforeseen factors are rising, and we have to be ready to withstand high winds, choppy waters, and even dangerous storms.”(1)The conservative approach reflects the pragmatic style of Xi  and CPC leaders. The pandemic has had a considerable impact on China's economy and people's lives. Just as it takes time to recover after a serious illness, people and the business community also need time to recover and regain confidence.Li Qiang is expected to become the next prime minister, and many outside China are not optimistic about him. Li has served as the party chief or governor of Zhejiang, Jiangsu and Shanghai, the three most economically developed provinces in China. During his tenure as governor of Zhejiang Province (2012-2016), Alibaba became a world-renowned company, Tesla's mega factory in Shanghai coincided with Li's Shanghai period (2017-2022). A five-percent-target would leave room and flexibility for the new administration to facilitate its work and secure better than expected results.Economic growth has become the key focus of governments across China. However, private entrepreneurs are still skeptical, and they doubt governments will implement their slogans and treat state-owned enterprises and private enterprises equally. Many are thinking that Li Qiang will be the solution to all problems because of his track record in Zhejiang, the province with the most developed private economy in China.

Beyond the economy, the 2 sessions also focus on trade and diplomacy. This meeting is occurring as tensions are high between the United States and China around a variety of issues — its relationship with Russia, trade policies, and Taiwan. Do you expect the meeting to lay out a roadmap about how China can address geopolitical tensions?
The 2 sessions may not spell out China’s international policies or global strategies, but a statement on Taiwan, the Taiwan Strait and the South China Sea will be there, for sure.
That statement will signal whether China will turn down or repeat its narration on the positions. In Li's report, he noted: In implementing the overall strategy for resolving the Taiwan question in the new era, it requires to resolutely launch major fights against separatism while promoting the peaceful development of cross-straits relations.
We expect China to be keen on promoting trade relations with its neighboring countries and creating Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) agreements to further trade. It will continue work on getting the Code of Conduct in the South China Sea signed.
As for Russia-Ukraine potential peace talk, China sees itself as the only nation that is in a position (maybe with the exception of France) to host these talks. All the traditional influential nations are involved in the conflict. India doesn’t have the will, and Turkey doesn’t have the influence. China has befriended both Ukraine and Russia, and has the resources to offer post-war rebuilding funding. This offer is already being met with skepticism and some derision in Europe and with the Ukrainians because of China's close ties to Russia. French President Macron’s visit to China in April might further reveal the peacemaking effort, but it's unlikely the U.S. will want to see this happen.
Do you expect or predict any surprises for the 2 sessions?
We expect to see three areas dominate this year's meetings to further consolidate China's power: ensure national public safety and security; stabilize monetary funds, insurance and stock markets; and promote science and technology investments.
Unlike procuratorate and courts, national security and judiciary are under the State Council, and Public Security dually reports  to the State Council and the Central Politics and Law Committee, which is directly under the politburo. Under current complex and harsh externalities, we may see the entire security area move under the party’s direct control rather than the State Council.
For the foreseeable future, the economy will remain a concern. We believe the banks, stock markets, and insurance markets, which have been separately supervised, will see a concentration of supervision of their operations. In this economic emergency mode, there may be some merit to direct control, if only to speed responses to ongoing crises.
The U.S. CHIPS and Science Act banned U.S. companies that take government aid to support chip manufacturing from engaging in significant transactions with China or "any other foreign country of concern." Banned transactions include helping other countries build up their own chip-building capabilities. The act made China realize its weaknesses in basic research and chip manufacturing. The new national system will pour resources into these “choke” areas. It makes sense for the party to centralize control and manage large projects such as chip making.
Former vice premier and Shanghai party chief Han Zheng (韩正), who likely will become China's vice president.

Lastly, we also believe  former vice premier and Shanghai party chief Han Zheng (韩正) will be chosen to serve as China's vice president, succeeding Wang Qi Shan. It's an interesting line-up, because Xi needs someone who knows how to manage colossal projects alongside him. In Han, Xi has someone who fits the bill. Currently China is halfway through two massive projects: the Hainan Pilot Free Trade Zone on Hainan Island in the South China Sea, and the Xiongan New Area, Xi's city of the future project, nearly 100 kilometers from Beijing.
