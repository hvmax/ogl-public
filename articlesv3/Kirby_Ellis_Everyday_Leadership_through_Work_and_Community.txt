### Kirby Ellis: Everyday Leadership through Work and Community

AtOn Global Leadershipwe have developed a new theory of leadership that steers away from the C-Suite, the charismatic leader approach to leading, and instead focuses on what people do as leaders in their lives on a daily basis – every day everyone a leader. We have written about this concept in several articles, profiling people likeDov Gelman,Jiyin Wang,Brayden Harrington, andmy mother(and for the humility emphasis in everyday leadership, seehereandhere).
I had an encounter recently that was both illuminating and humbling about the important qualities ofEveryday Leadership. It was illuminating because of the person I want to tell you about. It was humbling because of what the experience taught me about myself and my own implicit biases. Sidebar about implicit bias: I am writing about everyday leadership, but I think, in this case, there is a strain of bias that chastened me.
During the pandemic, while I was working from home, a knock at my door brought me into a conversation with Kirby Ellis. Kirby was looking for work. It was a very difficult time for everyone, and I agreed to hire him to mow my lawn weekly for the rest of the year.
Over the year, I found it difficult to deal with Kirby. He was demanding, wanted me to answer the door when I was on calls, and sometimes would have the temerity to mow my grass when my kids were still sleeping. As a result, I had decided to cut ties with Kirby.
I had recently moved into a rental home and now was finally in the process of moving my family into a new home. My father had come to help me move. I had warned my father about the dynamic with Kirby and told him that if Kirby showed up, just let me know. I would handle it.
Sure enough, one morning Kirby came by. He wanted to know what was going on. My father came in and told me that Kirby was outside and wanted to talk to me. I braced myself and went outside to deliver the news about parting ways. I had no idea of the leadership lesson I was in for.
Me: “Kirby, I want to thank you for all the work you have done. But I am moving right now, and I think we should probably part ways.”
Kirby: “What the hell are you doing?”
Me: “I’m not sure what you mean.”
Kirby: “What I mean is, you can stop doing grass cutting with me. I’ll go find other business. But are you really having your 80-year-old dad moving heavy stuff with you? Are you crazy? Somebody’s going to get hurt.”
Me: “I guess you are right. I should probably go call some movers.”
Kirby: “Screw that, man. I’m doing this for you. Get out of my way.”
Kirby then spent the rest of the afternoon moving all of the heavy items we had in my house. Every time I would try to help, he would say, “Get out of the way, young man, I got work to do.” By the end of the day, he was tired, but he had moved every heavy item by himself. But he needed help. As I left for the rental truck company, he told me he was going to find his nephew.
When I returned with the rental truck, Kirby was there with a young man, who I assumed was his nephew. As I approached the pair, I held out my hand and asked, “are you Kirby’s nephew.” Kirby quickly pulled me aside and said, “I need to talk to you.”
Kirby: “This is not my nephew. I needed help, to help you and your dad, but my nephew was not available. So, I went to the shelter. I know there are a lot of bad guys at the shelter, but I knew about Ben and he sits in the back of the shelter and reads his King James Bible all day every day. That is what he does. I asked him if he needed some work. I know you might be worried about vaxing and masking, but I promise you, he will wear a mask.”
In that moment, I realized that I had completely misjudged and misunderstood this man. I realized he was an Everyday Leader. Yes, he was difficult to deal with. Yes, he pushed hard for his business. But he was working hard to build a life through physical labor. And when he saw that I was putting my father at risk, he put himself in between us.
The whole experience was a reminder about the characteristics of humility and vision that are infused in Everyday Leadership. If we open our eyes, and our hearts, we find leaders every moment, every day. Everyday Leadership.
