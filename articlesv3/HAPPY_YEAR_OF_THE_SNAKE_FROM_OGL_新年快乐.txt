### HAPPY YEAR OF THE SNAKE FROM OGL… 新年快乐!

24 January 2025|China, Chinese Culture
At On Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy and, in particular, life in China. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. We have written about economic development in China and China’s economic reforms, U.S.-China relations, China’s changing role in the global political economy, and the history and the current state of Chinese politics. In this post, we offer a Happy Year of the Snake to our followers and celebrate the important partnerships we've developed over the past year.
The last five years for On Global Leadership have been a gift for me. I am so thankful for the work OGL has done with its many partners, friends, and followers. What has especially distinguished our first five years has been the unique and meaningful partnerships we have developed with organizations that share our goal of creating great dialogue and understanding between the United States and China.
One of those partnerships has been the work we’ve done in Phoenix with the Thunderbird School of Global Management’s Thunderbird Foreign Policy Initiative (TFPI). (This new initiative has been profiledhere,here,here,here, andhere).  Our journey with the TFPI began in 2024 with a series of public events, co-hosted by the TFPI and the Chinese Chamber of Commerce, Arizona. These gatherings explored the multifaceted nature of Chinese investments in the United States, with a particular focus on Arizona.
One of our ongoing partners and friends in our work and in this important area has been Global Ties, Arizona. So, this past week, the Thunderbird Foreign Policy Initiative hosted a table at the Global Ties, Arizona, Chinese New Year Celebration. At the dinner, we had a great Thunderbird-Table experience at the Global Ties Arizona Chinese New Year (CNY) Dinner celebration.
Deep thanks to Lena Booth, Deputy Dean of Thunderbird Academic Enterprise and Finance Professor, and Jonas Gamso, Deputy Dean of Thunderbird Knowledge Enterprise and Associate Professor, for being there. It meant so much to have some of Thunderbird’s distinguished leaders at the table.
Special thanks to Sean Fogerty for being there. As we continue to build our work on U.S.-China relations in the world and in Phoenix, Sean, Vice President for International Business Development at the Greater Phoenix Economic Council, will be an important partner with our work going forward with the Foreign Policy Initiative and with my work with the Chinese Chamber of Commerce. Thank you so much, Sean, for the collaborative energy you brought to the table.
Huge thanks to Jennifer Fondrevay and Dominic Frattura. Jennifer, you have been a leader of the Thunderbird alumni world for a long time (and you have been my good friend in the Executive Coaching world for the last five years). It meant a great deal to have you there, working your magic with the table. And, Dominic, you have been a true leader in helping us set up the TFPI. We could not have done this without you, and we are going to do great things together!
Huge thanks also to Aaron Eagles: thank you so much for being such a committed supporter of what we are doing at TFPI and the knowledge you bring of China to the table. It has meant a great deal to have you as such a constant and great participant.
Finally, the biggest thanks to Tate Mulligan, TFPI’s President, and Mitchel Halsema, VP of TFPI. You are doing such great work for Thunderbird. I am always so inspired by your leadership team. It is amazing work, and I am honored to be a part of it.
Looking forward to all of our work together in the CNY Year of the Snake and beyond.
