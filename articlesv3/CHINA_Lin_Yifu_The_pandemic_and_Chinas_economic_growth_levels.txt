Editorial Note: Here atOn Global Leadership, we seek to bring a political economic lens to issues of the day with a boots-on-the-ground perspective of how an issue is actually playing out in China. In this post, we present our own translation of a recent speech by economist Justin Yifu Lin (林毅夫), a Peking University (北京大学) professor and former World Bank Chief Economist and Senior Vice President, who assessed the state of China’s economy, how it will emerge from the pandemic period, and the importance of international cooperation at this time. Justin has had a storied career dating back to his defection to China from Taiwan in 1979 (a story told by great authors like Evan Osnos), his PhD in Economics from the University of Chicago, his ascension as a key economic advisor in China’s economic reforms, his rise to Chief Economist of the World Bank (the first Chinese national to occupy the position), and his return to China as a professor and founding director of the China Center for Economic Research at Peking University. Some Chinese economists are presenting arguments that are a little more conservative than Lin’s prediction of 3-4 percent GDP growth for China in 2020. However, it is our view that Professor Lin is close enough to the inner-circle conversations of the Central Government that his views can be trusted.

很荣幸能在这个特殊时期以这种新科技的方式和大家分享我的观点，我将介绍一下疫情对中国会造成什么影响，再讨论我们该怎么办。
I am honored to share my views with you in this new technology in this special period. I will introduce how the epidemic will affect China, and then discuss what we should do.
中国去年的GDP增长为6.1%，今年预期增长是5.6%或更高，只有这样才能保证在今年实现第一个百年目标。
2019年年底和今年年初，多数人都觉得今年完成这个增长目标是不难的，但疫情暴发让我们始料未及。
这次疫情从武汉开始暴发，1月23日武汉封城，很快全国都采取了类似防疫措施。春节以来，大部分中国人都在家中隔离。大部分经济活动在2月份停止或搬到线上，3月局势逐渐可控，政策重点转向了复工复产。
目前，复工复产的速度较慢。据调查，虽然90%的上市企业都已经复工，但由于担心第二波疫情，一些地方还是采取了偏严的防控措施。
同时，到了三月份欧美发达国家疫情暴发，许多出口产业订单骤减，除了和防疫有关的物资和设备生产以外，制造业的实际复工率可能只有30%，餐饮、娱乐，和人群聚集有关的行业复工会更慢
同时，城市地区失业率已快速上升，这会连带导致许多农村家庭和低收入人群遭受重创。
城市失业率已经从5.2%上升到6.2%，上升了100个基本点，而2008年金融危机失业率也从4.0%上升到4.3%，上升30个基本点。农村地区虽然没有正式的调查，但情况肯定更糟。
目前局势可能还要持续一段时间。根据国际金融协会的预测，全球的衰退马上就要到来。去年，他们预测全球经济增长率是2.6%，现在下调到了负的1.5%，美国的经济今年大概也会负增长2.8%，欧洲大概是负的4.7%。
Outbreak situation and its impact on economy
China’s GDP growth last year was 6.1 percent, and this year’s expected growth was 5.6 percent or higher. Only in this way can the first centenary target be guaranteed this year.
At the end of 2019 and the beginning of this year, most people felt that it was not difficult to complete this growth target this year, but the outbreak of the epidemic caught us unexpected.
The outbreak began in Wuhan, and the city was closed down on January 23. Soon, similar anti-epidemic measures were adopted throughout the country. Since the Spring Festival, most Chinese have been isolated at home. Most economic activities stopped or moved online in February. The situation in March was gradually controllable, and the policy focus shifted to resuming production.
At present, the speed of resuming operation and production is slow. According to the survey, although 90 percent of listed companies have resumed work, some places have taken strict prevention and control measures due to concerns of the second wave of the epidemic.
Meanwhile, because of the outbreaks in the developed countries in Europe and America in March, orders for many export industries plummeted. Beside the production of materials and equipment related to epidemic prevention, the actual recovery rate of manufacturing may be only 30 percent. Catering, entertainment, and crowd-gathering industries are even slower.
At the same time, the unemployment rate in urban areas has risen rapidly, which will a chain reaction to many rural families and low-income population.
The urban unemployment rate has risen from 5.2 percent to 6.2 percent, an increase of 100 basis points, while the 2008 financial crisis unemployment rate only rose from 4.0 percent to 4.3 percent, an increase of 30 basis points. Although there is no official investigation in rural areas, the situation is definitely worse.
The current situation may continue for some time. According to the forecast of the International Finance Association, a global recession is coming soon. Last year, they predicted that the global economic growth rate would be 2.6 percent, and now it has been reduced to -1.5 percent. The US economy will probably grow negatively by 2.8% percent this year, and Europe will probably grow by a negative 4.7 percent.
应对疫情，中国政府有哪些政策工具？
中国的增长必须依赖国内市场和需求。
过去政府应对经济危机主要靠投资拉动， 但这次，需要同时保护家庭、保障消费，帮企业渡过难关。
对于家庭来说，美国政府直接给每人发1200美元，但直接发钱并不是最好的方法。对支持消费更有效的方式是给城市贫困户、低收入家庭、失业人群和受影响的复工人员提供消费券。
在农村地区，必须加强社会保障网，提高低保水平，保障基本生活。
另外要支持企业，如免税或者减低税率、推迟社保医保缴费、提供流动性支持等。尤其要帮助中小企业，因为他们可以提供大量就业，是很多全球产业链的重要组成部分，他们的生存对中国渡过难关后保持全球制造业地位起着至关重要的作用。
这些建议已经在讨论或实施了。我们大概会有1万亿人民币（约1500亿美元）的刺激计划。政府也向银行下达了指令，为企业提供延缓利息支付，或者提供中小企业一些特殊的借贷便利等支持。
中国经济增长一个重要的推动力是投资。政府可以使用积极的财政政策和灵活的货币政策刺激投资。
在过去，出口市场是和私营投资紧密联系在一起的，而这次可能无法由私营部门来增加投资了，因为出口市场受到了重创。
所以政府需要发挥积极作用刺激投资。政府也已经提出新基建项目，包括5G，云计算，人工智能等。此外，也可以投资常规的基础设施，通过建设高铁，城市间轨道交通网，构建起更多更有效率的城市群。
我认为，政府可以使用积极的财政政策，也可以允许政府负债率上升。过去中国政府把每年的财政赤字控制在GDP的3%以内，而当前遭遇供给和需求双杀，今年应该允许政府财政赤字率上升到3%以上，甚至增加2-3个百分点。
其他可选择的政策工具还包括发行特别国债由央行购买、扩大开发银行贷款规模、增加地方专项债项目等。
What policy tools does the Chinese government have to deal with the epidemic?
China's growth must depend on the domestic market and demand.
In the past, the government mainly relied on investment to cope with the economic crisis. But this time, it is necessary to protect families and protect consumption at the same time, and help enterprises overcome difficulties.
For families, the US government directly pays $ 1,200 per person, but direct payment is not the best way. A more effective way to support consumption is to provide consumption vouchers to urban poor households, low-income families, the unemployed and the affected migrant workers.
In rural areas, it is necessary to strengthen the social security network, raise the level of subsistence allowances, and guarantee basic living.
In addition, it is necessary to support enterprises, such as tax exemption or tax rate reduction, postponement of social security medical insurance payment, and provision of liquidity support. In particular, it is necessary to help small and medium-sized enterprises, because they can provide a lot of employment and are an important part of many global industrial chains. Their survival plays a vital role in maintaining China's global manufacturing status after the difficulties.
These suggestions are already being discussed or implemented. We will probably have a 1 trillion yuan (about $150 billion US dollars) stimulus plan. The government has also issued instructions to banks to provide support for enterprises to postpone interest payments, or to provide some special loan facilities for SMEs.
An important driving force for China's economic growth is investment. The government can use active fiscal policies and flexible monetary policies to stimulate investment.
In the past, the export market was closely linked to private investment, but this time it may not be possible for the private sector to increase investment because the export market has been hit hard.
Therefore, the government needs to play an active role in stimulating investment. The government has also proposed new infrastructure projects, including 5G, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence. In addition, it is also possible to invest in conventional infrastructure and construct more high-efficiency urban agglomerations through the construction of high-speed rail and inter-city rail transit networks.
I think that the government can use a proactive fiscal policy, or it can allow the government debt ratio to rise. In the past, the Chinese government kept the annual fiscal deficit within 3 percent of GDP, but with the current encounter of double killing of supply and demand, this year we should allow the government's fiscal deficit rate to rise above 3 percent, or even increase by 2-3 percentage points.
Other optional policy tools include the issuance of special national bonds to be purchased by the central bank, expanding the size of development bank loans, and increasing local special debt projects.
一季度中国经济增长的预测在-6%到-10%之间，二季度也可能在1%上下，全年增长主要依靠第三和第四季度由投资拉动的反弹，如果能达到10%，那么，全年的增长率会在3%-4%之间。
从我国的财政和货币政策的空间以及政府的执行能力来说，要全年达到5%或更高的增长并非不可能，但那样第三、第四季度的同比增长需要达到15%左右。
考虑到疫情防控需要常态化和全球金融经济的不确定性，今年勉强去达到这样的目标也许不是最好的选择。
其实，在全球经济负增长的情况下，能达到3%-4%的增长已经是很了不起的成绩。
China Economic Growth Forecast
The forecast of China's economic growth in the first quarter is between -6 percent and -10 percent, and it may be around 1 percent in the second quarter. The annual growth mainly depends on the rebound in the third and fourth quarters, which can only be driven by investment. Then, the annual growth rate will be between 3 percent and 4 percent.
From the perspective of China's fiscal and monetary policy space and the government's ability to execute, it is not impossible to achieve 5 percent or higher growth throughout the year, but then the year-on-year growth in the third and fourth quarters needs to reach about 15 percent.
Considering the new norm of epidemic prevention and control and the uncertainty of the global financial and economy, force to achieve such a goal this year may not be the best choice.
In fact, in the case of negative global economic growth, it is already a remarkable achievement to realize growth of 3-4 percent.
问：中国能否像美国那样直接给民众发钱，并向中小企业提供财政支持？
林毅夫：这次中国应该更多的去支持家庭和中小企业。
支持家庭有两种方法，一是给现金，二是发消费券。我个人认为消费券更有效，因为人们拿到现金可能不会去消费，所以不会直接转化为需求。
根据地区和月份不同，消费券可以相应地变化，但是重点是要去扶持贫困、低收入家庭和失业人员，提供基本保障。
中国政府也需要帮助中小企业渡过难关，中国在全球产业链中保住自己的份额是非常重要的。中国政府已经采取了减税减费和还款方面的措施。同样我们也需要给他们财政方面的支持，比如到期债务的展期，和新的贷款机制等。
政府的刺激政策需要考虑投资效率。5G等新基建项目，比如华为可能会从中获得很大利好，同时还有围绕数据中心的政策，很多民企会从中获益。还有一些城镇化项目，比如建设城市群间的轨道交通网，有些可能会有高铁项目等。
投资项目的选择要以进一步提高我国的生产力水平为依据，虽然政府支持的项目一部分会给到国企，但我认为这次大多数的公司无论是国有还是私营企业都会受益。
Question: Can China directly send money to the people like the US and provide financial support to small and medium-sized enterprises?
Lin Yifu: This time China should give more support to families and SMEs.
There are two ways to support families, one is to give cash, and the other is to issue coupons. I personally think that consumption coupons are more effective, because people may not consume when they get cash, so it will not be directly converted into demand.
Depending on the region and month, consumption vouchers can change accordingly, but the focus is on supporting poor, low-income families and the unemployed to provide basic security.
The Chinese government also needs to help small and medium-sized enterprises to overcome difficulties. It is very important for China to maintain its share in the global industrial chain. The Chinese government has taken measures to reduce taxes, fees, and repayments. We also need financial support for them, such as the renewal of due debts and new loan mechanisms.
Government stimulus policies need to consider investment efficiency. New infrastructure projects such as 5G, Huawei, and alike may benefit greatly from it, and there are policies around the data center, many private enterprises will benefit from it. There are also some urbanization projects, such as the construction of rail transit networks between urban agglomerations, and some may have high-speed rail projects.
The choice of investment projects should be based on the further improvement of China’s productivity level. Although part of the government-supported projects will be given to state-owned enterprises, I think most of the companies this time will benefit whether they are state-owned or private enterprises.
问：国际合作如何促进全球经济发展？能否举个例子？
林毅夫：国际合作非常重要，我也非常高兴看到3月19日的网上G20峰会做出了5万亿美元应对疫情的承诺。
这对南半球发展中国家尤其重要，疫情今后可能会在一些拉美、非洲等国家暴发，他们的防疫能力和医疗条件有限，所以疫情防控可能不会很有效，除了分享经验，国际社会应该给他们提供资金，让他们能够采取合适的防疫措施，包括提供个人防护设备、医疗设备等。
另外也需要更多的国家联合起来，不然可能会有第二波、第三波的暴发，年底之前甚至到有效的疫苗问世之前可能都不见得能把疫情完全控制住，所以国际合作非常重要。
Question:How can international cooperation promote global economic development? Can you give us an example?
Lin Yifu:International cooperation is very important. I am also very happy to see that the online G20 summit on March 19 made a US$ 5 trillion commitment to respond to the epidemic.
This is especially important for developing countries in the southern hemisphere. The pandemic situation may occur in some Latin American and African countries in the future. Their epidemic prevention capacity and medical conditions are limited. Therefore, epidemic prevention and control may not be very effective. In addition to sharing experience, the international community should provide funds to enable them to take appropriate epidemic prevention measures, including the provision of personal protective equipment and medical equipment.
In addition, more countries need to join forces, otherwise there may be a second and third wave of resurgences. Before the end of the year, even before the availability of effective vaccines, it may not be possible to completely control the epidemic. So, international cooperation is very important.
