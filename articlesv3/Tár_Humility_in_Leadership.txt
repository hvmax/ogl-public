### "Tár" & Humility in Leadership

13 February 2023
We continue our series of pieces asking what we can learn about leadership from the Oscar-nominated Best Picture films announced by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Like most of you, we are moved by the culture around us, and often we learn from that culture. We decided to take a look at the 10 nominated films and see what insights about leadership we can glean from the characters, themes, or locations. Our next contribution in this series is about the remarkable "Tár."
Tár: A Failure in Humility
By Doug Guthrie and Sarah Kellogg
Unrestrained egos are not uncommon for charismatic leaders. After all, the ego structure of people who rise to the top of organizations is such that the more confident you are the more successful you are likely to be. You can rise to great heights, and believe in your infallibility.
But also, the fall from those heights can be extreme and devastating.
Enter Tár’s central character, renowned conductor Lydia Tár, who is one of those out-size, narcissistic leaders who are also treated like cultural superstars, with the requisite cult following and an egomaniacal appreciation for her own talents and societal value.
At OGL, we believe that humility is an essential trait for creative leaders, even though it may seem quaint, even a bit anachronistic in these days of splashy TikTok fame. Yet humility and the ability to admit error may be two of the most important qualities a leader must have. They must be deeply in tune with human behavior, and, most critically, understand who they are and what motivates them to success and what can precipitate their failures. It’s those failures that can kill you.
I’ve personally experienced the costs of vanity running roughshod over humility. As Dean of the George Washington University School of Business, at the young age of 40, success came early, and overwhelmingly. Rewards for such success tempt us to forget listening to and genuinely caring about the people we are charged with leading. Despite the success, or maybe because of it, I began to feel invulnerable, and I lost my way.
The cost of my pride and self-admiration was public humiliation, as I was fired by the university president and the dismissal was widely covered in the media. After that, I frequently encountered work colleagues, prospective employers, and intellectual peers who were aware of my fall from grace or read a story that detailed my failings.
In Tár, we are treated to a raging ego and a subsequent sharp fall from grace. While not wanting to give away the plot, let us say Tár is a victim of her own vanity and her inability to care about the people around her as she marches toward her singular vision. Her blindness to her faults drives the drama. Her unwillingness to acknowledge her errors makes her fall all the steeper. Her final humiliation does not deter her vision or her passion, but she has managed to lose her leadership position and all its trappings.
In this sense, Tár proves to be the ideal morality tale for today’s leaders. Allow your ego to rage unchecked, and ignore the people and institutions that have helped bring you to the highest levels of power, and the costs to you and your career can be catastrophic, as they were for Tár.
