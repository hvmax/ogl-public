### The 6th China International Import Expo is Back, with a Splash

14 November 2023|China, Chinese Culture, Trade
AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy and, in particular, life in China. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. We have written about international trade and consumer trends in China, and China’s ambitious goals and initiatives to build out its economy. In this post, Chris Gao recounts his experience attending the in-person 6th China International Import Expo, which is a traditional OGL touchstone for China economic development, consumer interests, and trade.
The 6th China International Import Expo (CIIE) was held in Shanghai from November 5 to 10, 2023. A total of 3,486 companies from 128 countries and regions participated in the CIIE , the total intention-to-deal amount over the year reached $78.41 billion, an increase of 6.7% over the previous session.
OGL has a history of attending the trade fair and sharing our impressions. This event is CIIE's first return to in-person exhibition since the onset of COVID-19, and we are happy to share our thoughts and perceptions here.
Four years ago, when On Global Leadership was in its early stages of building its presence, one of our posts analyzed the 2nd CIIE. At the time, it was a growing venture that was set up to attract foreign investment and foreign products into China, as it continued to build a world class “Double Circulation” economy. Organizers at the 2nd CIIE described the event as, “China is further opening its market. Belt and Road initiative is accelerating. CIIE in its second year is the most important event around this initiative and provides the unique opportunity for open development and cooperation between China and the world. Companies who want to take advantage of this need to participate at CIIE…” Today, the CIIE site describes it more simply and forcefully: “The CIIE has become a showcase of China’s new development paradigm, a platform for high-standard opening up, and a public good for the whole world.”
So, how do things look four years later? The 6th CIIE has become a go-to on the international trade calendar for global conglomerates, countries, and regions. It has also drawn some detractors as it further establishes China's role as the preeminent global market to woo and, if possible, capture. For example, on November 3, 2023, the eve of CIIE's grand opening, the EU Chamber of Commerce in China criticized the upcoming trade fair as being "a political show rather than a trade fair, full of smoke and mirrors ... lacking the tangible outcomes necessary to restore business confidence."
Meanwhile, AmCham Shanghai and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) hosted the American Food and Agriculture Pavilion, the first time the U.S. government has participated in CIIE. An acknowledgement that the CIIE is more than mere window dressing.
An American Presence
CIIE was an important platform to showcase American products and services. The pavilion's opening ceremony featured remarks from AmCham Shanghai President Eric Zheng, U.S. Ambassador to China Nicholas Burns, and USDA Acting Deputy Under Secretary Jason Hafemeister, as well as Shanghai Friendship Association President Chen Jing. Other honored guests joined the speakers in the ribbon-cutting ceremony, including US Consul General to Shanghai Scott Walker, AmCham Shanghai Chairman Sean Stein, USDA Agricultural Trade Office Shanghai Director Lashonda McLeod Harper, and CIIE Bureau Director Ge Hong.
This is Tyson's fourth appearance at CIIE. To further enhance corporate visibility, industry influence, and brand reputation, CIIE has provided Tyson's headquarters more opportunity to present its understanding of the Chinese market and business environment.
General Mills brought in its Blue Buffalo pet food to the 4th CIIE in 2021 (online). Two years later, the food company held a special launch event at the 6th CIIE to boost Blue Buffalo in China through all its distribution channels.
Lead by Ambassador Burns (pictured in the upper right in Figure 2), the United States accounted for one of the largest country presences at the 6th CIIE, with more than 200 companies participating in the expo, including a wide range of U.S. agriculture, automotive, technology, pharmaceutical, and healthcare firms. China is the largest overseas market for U.S. agricultural goods. In 2022, China imported $40.8 billion from the United States, 20% of all America's agricultural exports.
Tesla and Other Auto Brands
2023 marks Tesla's 10th anniversary of entering China and its sixth year participating in CIIE. Compared with other auto makers, Tesla shines a spotlight. Other than exploded parts of a Model Y at the center of Tesla pavilion (upper right), visitors are willing to cater to Tesla’s small trick - acquiring a GIGA badge if they provide the correct sequence of Tesla’s manufacturing process (middle and lower right). The overall impression of Tesla’s pavilion presentation is that it is not selling a car in a traditional sense, but a consumer electronic product.
Like previous exhibitions, the Ford (top left) and GM (bottom right) pavilions are satisfactory but with no surprises in Figure 4. Toyota (top right) showcased its strength in hydrogen energy vehicles with a variety of products and technologies; Nissan (bottom left) still hasn't figured out how to attract visitors’ attention.
Marketing Consumer Goods
For big brands, CIIE is a place to showcase their marketing and brand image, as well as government relationships. Inditex's booth (top) covers over 500 square meters, featuring Zara's brand history and sustainability topics. Steinway & Sons (bottom left) hopes to expand the brand’s influence by telling more people about its century-old technology and perfect quality.
Headquartered in New Zealand, Zespri (bottom right) is the world's largest marketer of kiwifruit. On November 6th, 2023, Zespri Chairman Bruce Cameron and its Board Advisor and former New Zealand Prime Minister Sir John Key met with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi in Beijing before attending the 6th CIIE in Shanghai.
Since 2018, the LEGO Group has attended all six exhibitions and has steadily expanded its business in China. As of the end of September 2023, the number of Lego retail stores has increased from 50 in 2018 to 469 in China today, with the number of cities covered growing from 18 to 122. At its booth, people could see the worldwide debut of new products rich in Chinese cultural elements, and how LEGO has been cooperating with the Ministry of Education of China to train kindergarten teachers all over China.
CIIE is a platform for foreign exhibitors to market and promote their products, and engage China government stakeholders. Most of the visitors from all over the country belong to middle-income groups or the wealthy, and they represent the customer base of international brands. Whether CIIE is a platform for "China to buy the world", or a ‘Political Showcase’, depends on the exhibitors, who will have their own motives. As long as exhibitors attend CIIE, they should make good use of this hard-won opportunity to get to know China, the Chinese market, and Chinese consumers.
