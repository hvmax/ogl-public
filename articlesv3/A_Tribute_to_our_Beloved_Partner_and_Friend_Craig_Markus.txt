### A Tribute to our Beloved Partner and Friend Craig Markus

9 August 2023|Creative Leadership
AtOn Global Leadership, we strive to make the world a little bit better, one step at a time, a few words at a time. We have been fortunate to have a team of people who respect and admire each other as we have built our presence in the world of creative leadership. This week we lost our dear friend, colleague, and partner Craig Markus. The world will deeply miss his presence and voice. And we will deeply miss his friendship and partnership.
Some posts are joyous to write – an idea comes into your mind, one you want to share with the world, and you sit down to writ, and the words just flow. This post is different. Yesterday, we lost our dear friend and colleague Craig Markus. Craig was a core member of our On Global Leadership team. It is with deep sadness that we mourn Craig’s passing.

Craig died of complications from Guillain-Barre Syndrome. He was young and vibrant, and he still had so much more living to do. Devastating as this news has been, I would like to take this moment to celebrate him, a brilliant, creative, thoughtful force in the world.
Craig was a magnificent creative leader. He wouldn’t have used that term to describe himself in the early days of his career, but it is how we know him today. (He would have used the term “creative” to describe himself for sure, but the term “creative leader” was part of the journey Craig was on during the time that I knew him.)
As Craig built his career, he rose through the ranks as a star in the creative industry. After college, Craig began his brilliant career as a studio artist. He then moved into the agency world, working with Ogilvy and Mather, Deutsch, DMB&B, and McCann-Erickson, where he served as Executive Creative Director. Most recently, until his unexpected passing, he served as the Chief Creative Officer for Proof Advertising.
Craig worked on and led award-winning campaigns for such brands as Snapple, Coca-Cola, Goodyear, Major League Baseball, the list goes on and on. Remember the indelible tagline “Army Strong”? Yeah, that was Craig. The ad industry is not my field, but as I grew to know Craig over the last two decades, I learned that this insightful, humble friend was a rockstar in his field.
I met Craig about 15 years ago when he was embarking on a new journey in his already illustrious career. Sometime around 2007, Michael Conrad, a legend in the creative industries and the Founder of the Berlin School of Creative Leadership, approached OGL Partner David Slocum and me about leading the academic side of a new venture he was starting, the Berlin School of Creative Leadership (BSCL). Michael’s idea was that, while creatives rise through the agency ranks in the creative industry, they are often recognized for and rise through the ranks because of their creative talent. They are given more and more responsibility but then often find themselves unprepared for the responsibilities tied to leading a business. Michael wanted to build an institution that would teach creatives how to lead.
Intrigued, David and I took this on and quickly found ourselves teaching business and leadership skills to a group of brilliant young creatives. Craig was in that inaugural BSCL class of young, rising creative leaders, and it was truly such a gift to meet him. David and I coached Craig in the writing of his Master’s Thesis, “Rage and Grace,” which was his take on how the creative industry needed to evolve and what type of leadership it would take to get there. Those ideas became the basis for a venture he would launch, Rage, Grace & Partners.

Craig and I developed a close friendship during that time. I loved sitting and talking with him. Initially, our friendship proved a mutual education for both of us. He was learning about leadership, and I was learning about the creative industries. He was so patient and generous with my basic questions and exploration of the industry. And very quickly, a relationship of mutual benefit transformed into a close friendship. We talked deeply about career aspirations, work-life balance, being a good Dad, and the pain that comes to those who have a tendency toward anxiety and depression. Craig was an amazing listener and became a very supportive friend, standing close when I experienced some of my deepest and most painful moments career-wise and personally. Craig was such a generous, empathetic listener, and I will never forget the gifts of those conversations.
We stayed close friends over the next decade. He was there as a kind, firm, empathetic listener when I was very publicly fired from a job. And when I decided suddenly to leave a good job and follow a dream of starting a virtual think tank that would write and teach about China and creative leadership, Craig was there for those conversations. I know he was skeptical about some of my decisions in those times, but there he was – kind, generous, supportive, raising hard questions, always bringing his creativity to bear. Eventually, Craig agreed to join our little team – David, Sarah, Craig and I would embark on this vision of a virtual think tank on Creative Leadership together. I remember in August of 2020, when Craig posted his wonderful article “What the World Needs Now is Creative Leaders,” I was so proud of the post and proud to have Craig on our team.
It has truly been one of the great gifts of the last fifteen years to know and become close to Craig. He was a remarkable, creative, generous, and humble human being. He touched my life, and I will be forever thankful for the time I was able to spend with him. I will miss him deeply.
