### Looking for Opportunity in China in the Next Five Years

2 November 2020|China, China politics, Trade
AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy and, in particular, life in China. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. We use our analyses to advance conversations about a range of issues including US-China relations, local economic development in China, and opportunities for doing business in China. In this post, we explore the policy statements and opportunities that came out of 14th 5-Year Plan Document, released on October 29, 2020. – The Editorial Team
By The On Global Leadership Team
The 14th “Five-Year Plan” (5YP) is the programmatic document for China’s economic development over the next five years (2021-2025), as well as its “dual circulation” growth strategy. Not only does it determine the direction of China's industry and enterprises, it also points in the direction of future market opportunities. A boon for western corporations hoping to get a leg up in China.
Some important time nodes of the 14th 5YP rollout:
On October 29, the Fifth Plenary Session of the 19th Central Committee of the CPC announced the gist of the 14th 5YP together with the long-term prospects for 2035;In early November, the full text of the draft proposal from the CPC Central Committee of the 14th 5YP will be released;In the middle of March 2021, the National People’s Congress will examine and approve the document, and then the full text of the 14th 5YP will be released as the official guideline;Next year, the 14th 5YP’s strategic and emerging industries will be revealed.

Top-Level Design
The Party’s Central Committee meeting was held from Oct. 26 to 29, right before the U.S. election. The timing of the meeting was not an accident, and it suggests how the Chinese view its development and planning--both independent of the U.S. administration change and other external influences. Self-reliance is the prerequisite and foundation for China’s opening up and cooperation based on equality and mutual respect. This is not first time Beijing has mentioned that American uncertainty should not effect China’s plans. The mindset projected from Beijing is: let’s ignore externalities, mind our own business; regardless of what happens in the United States, our governance philosophy will not change.
Promoting Consumption Upgrades
In an earlier post onChina’s Double Circulation System, we discussed China’s key policies guiding the country in the transition from investment-led growth to consumption-led growth. This is an incredibly important transition for the world’s soon-to-be largest economy, as the leaders guiding the economy look to avoid what economists call the “middle income trap,” where economies become too dependent on investment-led growth (building infrastructure does create jobs after all) and cannot make the transition to a healthy consumption-based economy.
This topic was revisited during the meetings of the 14th 5YP, and they focused on expanding domestic demand and promoting consumption as the keys:
1. With the development of the new urbanization program, the application scenarios of service industries are expanding. By the end of 2019, 60.6% of Chinese residents lived in urban setting, compared with the urbanization level of 70% ~ 80% in developed countries. China’s urbanization rate is expected to reach 70-75% by 2030.
Through the integration of urban and rural development, the new urbanization will solve the problems of infrastructure, public services, and labor disparities caused by the urban-rural dual structure. The focus on consumption here is not just about economic growth, however. Improving efficiency in production and the flow of goods, helping to grow the private sector, and unleashing entrepreneurship will bring real benefit to Chinese citizens.
It is estimated that during the 14th 5YP period, the expansion and deepening of the service industry will become a development focus, and the consumption potential of the 3rd and 4th tier cities and towns will be tapped. Prioritizing domestic consumption is a first for the 13 5YPs we have seen before. This is not just a development issue; it also reflects the tensions with China’s largest trading partner, the United States.
Focus areas: e-commerce, logistics and transportation, information and media services.
2. The aging population is increasing, and so the growth potential for health care and related industries. It is estimated that by 2025, the number of people over 65 in the total population will reach 15%, compared to the current 13%. Driven by the aging population, China’s demand structure and consumption patterns will change, which will drive increased demand for medical and health care, health and wellness, tourism, culture ,and other recreational fields.
Focus areas: biomedical, medical and health, senior care, and tourism.
3. Consumption patterns in culture and entertainment will also increase. In the last decade, China’s urban per capita disposable income grew from 19,109 yuan (USD 2,730) in 2010 to 42,359 yuan (USD 6,050) in 2019. With this rate of increase year-on-year, the material demand for basic living will be fully met soon. Therefore, it is expected that the consumption in the cultural and non-material fields will usher in a significant development in the consumption economy.
Focus areas: cultural entertainment, sports, artistic experience, etc.
Technological Innovation
Scientific and technological innovation and the promotion of total factor productivity are critical driving forces for China to realize the transformation of economic growth towards the “big domestic circulation” and “domestic and international dual circulation.” China’s scientific and technological innovation will focus on the two priorities:
China will focus on tackling the “choke technologies”, accelerating the process of domestic substitution, and promoting the transformation and upgrading of the manufacturing industry. (China calls the technologies the U.S .refuses to sell to China “choke technologies,” technologies denied to China by the US in order to restrain China’s advancement.) We would note here that the last Politburo Study Session was on quantum computing. The previous study sessions covered AI, blockchain, etc. For 14th 5YP, the leaders are clearly trying to form policy that helps China seize the opportunity to upgrade in these technical areas to put the country on par with the best in the world. Focus areas: chips and semiconductors, precision machinery, fine chemicals, high-end equipment (machine tools and medical devices), new materials, aerospace technology, auto parts, etc.Enhance the penetration of the digital economy. The digital economy includes industrial digitization and digital industrialization. The policy roadmap of digital industrialization is to rely on 5G information technology to promote the application implementation in five aspects of “big data, artificial intelligence, Internet of things (IOT), mobile Internet, and cloud computing.” Industry digitization is to realize the digital transformation of existing industrial network, which greatly improves the production efficiency. Industrial Internet is a disruptive game changer for the future manufacturing.

Optimizing the energy structure and increasing the proportion of clean energy is not only important for the development of a green economy, but also a long-term strategy to reduce the dependence on external energy sources, thus improving energy security.
On April 9, 2020, the State Energy Administration issued a notice pointing out that renewable energy will become the principal factor in energy consumption during the 14th 5YP period, and the document promoted renewable energy to continuously reduce costs, expand scale, optimize distribution, and improve quality and efficiency. The goal by 2030 is to ensure that non-fossil fuel energy consumption will account for more than 20% of the nation’s energy consumption. During the 13th 5YP period, China achieved the target of 15% non-fossil fuel energy in advance in 2019. It is expected that the 14th 5YP will set higher targets to ensure that the targets can be achieved by 2030. In this context, the clean energy industry and the new energy vehicle industry are expected to see rapid growth.
Focus areas: photovoltaic, wind power, hydropower, nuclear power, new energy vehicle industry’s supply chain.
The Development of Large Urban Agglomerations
During the 14th 5YP, China’s powerful migrant labor force will be further concentrated in the leading cities, thus speeding up the implementation of the development strategy for metropolitan areas and city clusters driven by the regional central cities (中心城市). We have written about this issue in our recent analysis ofthe rise of Zhengzhou and a powerful Tier 1 Chinese city. NDRC has advanced the formation of a number of metropolitan areas, which are set to gain global influence by 2035. In the near future, restrictions on the Hukou (户口) movement to all cities – except for the “mega cities” – will be relaxed. Recall that China’s Hukou system, also known as the household passport system, restricts Chinese citizens from freely moving around the country. Relaxing this system will mean a more rapid rise in urbanization. Further, the focus on urban agglomeration will be tied together with policies that support the integration of technology in consumption markets, financial services, and other aspects of market access.
Focus areas: rail transit construction, smart city and security, Greater Bay Area.
National Defense and a Military (and Space) Industrial Complex
With the recent rise in global geopolitical tensions and conflicts, risks are escalating, and the uncertainty of Sino-U.S. relations increasing, the 14th 5YP puts forward higher requirements for China’s national defense. During the 14th 5YP period, China is expected to continue to strengthen the construction of nation defense in equipment upgrading, military informatization and civil-military integration. Thus, the future development space of the defense industry will be broad.
Focus areas: UAV/drones, large aircraft, satellite, Beidou navigation (BDS), aircraft carrier, etc.
To summarize, the 14th 5YP communiqué emphasizes a few key areas of focus: self-reliance, a consumption-based economic growth strategy, technological innovation, clean energy, the development of urban agglomerations, and an aggressive investment in national defense and the building of a military (and space) industrial complex. As we have noted in our editorial comments above, we think the explicit focus on the building of a consumption-led growth economy is notable in the context of the 5YPs. This is not new for China, as the country has been focusing on the dual circulation system for some time now. However, to codify this issue in the 14th 5YP (as the lead issue, no less), suggests that the government is thinking very deeply about the transition from investment-led growth to consumption-led growth. The focus on technology (including the “choke technologies”) and clean energy are not that surprising – these are issues that China has focused on for some time now – however, what these areas of focus suggest about China’s role in the world is noteworthy. First there is the issue of dependence – whether in the areas of dependence (in technology or energy), the Chinese leadership is sending a clear signal that self-reliance will be an important part of China’s emergence as the world’s largest economy, which will happen during the 14th 5Y period. But there is also an issue of leadership. Despite popular images of pollution in China, the country has actually been a leader in the renewable energy space over the last decade. Chinese leaders also clearly would like to position the country as a leader in technology on par with the most powerful and innovative economies throughout the world. As a final note, it is interesting that the 14th 5YP does not even mention GDP goals, suggesting that the leadership is much more interested in thinking about real economy and society issues rather than growth goals.
