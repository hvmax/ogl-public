AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy and, in particular, life in China. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. Among other things, We have sought to advance a conversation about what leadership in these times of crisis might look like. In this post, our third and final Cold War-era history post, our team takes an historical look at U.S.-China relations through the lens of the Vietnam War to help guide the conversation of where tensions might be headed today. – The Editorial Team

Over a 15-year period in the mid-20th century, two wars in Asia delineated the Cold War and helped define the relationship between the United States and China. The Vietnam War was the second conflict of the two, following on the Korean War, but it distinctly differed in its tone and dimension.

The Korean War was marked by distrust and misunderstanding, mostly because China and the U.S. didn’t understand the decision-making mechanisms of the other, yet Vietnam proved more restrained. It’s clear that the first conflict proved effective preparation for the second. Throughout the Vietnam War, U.S. ground forces never went north of the 17th parallel, and China did not send troops to directly confront the U.S.—both of which had happened disastrously in the Korean War.
The lessons of the Korean War had taken. The U.S. and China had built a tacit understanding and a confidence in the behavior of their adversaries: Neither party had the intention of direct military confrontation; both parties understood the red lines of their rivals. The mutual confidence built though these initial engagements laid the foundation for the subsequent ice-breaking journey between the two countries and the establishment of mutual trust allowing for the normalization of relations.
Similar slogan, different strategy
The American military, eager to put the frustrations of the Korean War behind it, began to pay more attention to Indochina in the late 1950s. So did China. From 1960 to 1965, American involvement in Vietnam gradually escalated. On May 1, 1965, China’s Labor Day, thePeople's Dailypublished an editorial, formally proposing the slogan, “Aid Vietnam and Resist U.S. aggression (援越抗美)”. Fifteen years earlier in the Korean War, the Chinese government published a similar slogan: “Resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea (抗美援朝)”. The decision to put "Aid Vietnam" before "Resist U.S. aggression" illuminated China’s Vietnam strategy. China would support the Viet Cong, but it would try to avoid fighting another war against the U.S. in Vietnam.
There were several reasons for such strategy. First, it reflects its experience from the Korean War. The huge price paid in Korea forced Chinese leaders to concede that the U.S. was a powerful and hostile adversary. Therefore, avoiding direct military conflicts with the U.S. became an important consideration in China's policy making. Another factor was the deterioration of China-Soviet relations. The China-Soviet alliance had disintegrated. China could not afford to fight a battle on two fronts.
Moreover, China’s leader Mao Zedong was considering the launch of the Cultural Revolution. Although China still regarded the U.S. as the primary threat, it had realized the U.S. was amenable to crisis management mechanisms to protect geo-security. Instead of repeating past mistakes and ignoring China's warnings, as U.S. leaders had at the beginning of the Korean War, the Johnson administration paid attention to signals sent by the Chinese government. The two sides simultaneously sent "avoiding direct confrontation" messages.
Build mutual confidence between adversaries
From 1960 to the end of 1968 when Richard Nixon was elected president of the United States, China and the U.S. were in deep hostility. Despite the bad blood, the nations engaged through public statements, private messages, and battlefield postures during the war, thus avoiding direct military conflict.
In June 1962, the Americans signaled early on their intentions. During the talks between the U.S. and Chinese ambassadors to Poland, the U.S. ambassador John Cabot emphasized that the United States had no plans to help Taiwan attack China’s mainland. Soon after, the Kennedy administration relayed through the Soviet Union a message that the U.S. didn't intend to escalate tensions in Asia.
With this information in hand, Chinese leaders believed that the U.S. had a limited desire of military intervention. Even so, after the Gulf of Tonkin incident on July 30, 1964, the Chinese government issued a statement saying, "the U.S. invasion to the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is the invasion to China", and it drew a red line for China's direct military intervention in Vietnam. After March 1965, Beijing made another statement saying that China was planning to send personnel to Vietnam to fight U.S. forces.
Behind the scenes, China was still talking with the U.S. On April 2, 1965, Premier Zhou Enlai asked Mohammad Ayub Khan, the President of Pakistan, to convey three sentences to the U.S.: "First, China will not take the initiative to provoke a war against the United States. Second, what the Chinese has said counts. Third, China has made preparations,” according to Zhou’s chronicles. On May 31, the Chinese Foreign Minister relayed the same message to the U.S. side through Donald Hopson, the British Chargé d'Affaires in Beijing.
One week later, the British told Beijing that they had forwarded the message to Dean Rusk, the U.S. Secretary of State. China never made public its decision to send supporting troops to Vietnam, or that the military operations of Chinese troops were restricted within Northern Vietnam. Between June 1965 and March 1968, the total number of Chinese troops in North Vietnam totaled some 320,000. Although the U.S. soon discovered the whereabouts of the Chinese troops, they did not publicly announce the information.
These events occurred at a time when the U.S. and China had been in conflict and disengaged for a long time. There were no economic ties, few public exchanges, and no mutual trust. Even under such circumstances, leaders of the two countries were still able to find a fundamental consensus: prevent another direct war. Both nations continuously sent out signals, maintained a certain degree of restraint in their actions, and sought to avoid misjudgments and miscalculations.
Insights to current U.S.-China relations
The lessons from Vietnam were clear and laid the groundwork for some 40 years of peace between the two nations. Vietnam proved that effective interactions—publicly and behind the scenes—could reduce conflicts and eliminate crises. It’s a lesson we could apply today. The mutual trust between the U.S. and China has nearly worn away in recent years, and the risk of military friction is rising. It is not only feasible but alsonecessaryfor the U.S. and China to maintain contacts and exchanges at every level.
How do we find our way through this period? If we could apply those Cold War lessons now, we would focus on four key diplomatic principles: maintain multiple communications channels; emphasize direct exchanges; choose the right messenger; and ensure the message is clear. The process of liaison between China and the U.S. during the Vietnam War proved that direct communications at various levels worked better than any vague public statements. And if information is conveyed through a third party, it should be a trusted messenger. For example, at the beginning of the Korean War, China picked K.M. Panikkar, the Indian ambassador, to pass critical information to the Americans, but he was known as pro-communist and his information was considered suspect. In contrast, during the Vietnam War, messengers chosen by China were the president of Pakistan and representatives of the British government, both had credibility with the U.S.
Finally, the expression of the message must be clear. In the Korean War, China used a vague expression "China will take care of the situation"(中国要管). During the Vietnam War, Premier Zhou repeatedly stated China's four-point position: "(1) China will not take the initiative to provoke a war with the United States." "(2) What the Chinese has said counts." "(3) China has made preparations." "(4) When a war starts, there will be no boundaries." This was a clear and firm message that wasn’t ignored.
Today, the U.S. and China regard the other as their biggest strategic adversary. In order to establish effective crisis management and control mechanisms, China should broadcast its strategy and goals more clearly, and make its defense policies and intentions more transparent. The two countries should continue candid dialogues, listen to each other's point of view, and acknowledge and resolve legitimate concerns. In a world dominated by social media and where populism prevails, if even one country can exhibit verbal restraint, it will help cool public sentiments in a war of rhetoric and prevent self-fulfilling prophecies.
Trust is a scarce commodity; it is also the best adhesive to bridge the relationship between countries. There are a thousand reasons to make the China-U.S. relationship a success, and none whatsoever to wreck it. China as a party that has relatively benefited more from the normalization of this important bilateral relationship should take the initiative to increase mutual trust between the two countries.
