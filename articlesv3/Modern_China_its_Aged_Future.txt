### Modern China & its Aged Future

24 October 2023|China, China politics, China Population
AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy and, in particular, life in China. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. We have written about economic development in China and China’s economic reforms, U.S.-China relations, China’s changing role in the global political economy, and the history and current state of Chinese politics. In this post, we address one of the key issues China is facing in its modern economic development era – China’s demography and the aging population. Currently, the OGL Team is working on a book, tentatively titled Masters of Capitalism: Why Communist China will be the World’s Most Powerful Economy for Decades to Come. This post is part of a series we have written to address questions we are receiving in response to our positive views of China’s economic prospects for the decades to come. As we begin to share our arguments of this book more widely, we have encountered a variety of questions. These questions generally fall into categories that include (1) the comparative strength of China’s manufacturing supply chain, (2) China’s internal political dynamics, (3) China’s changing role in the geopolitical system, and (4) China’s changing demographic circumstances, among others. In this post, we briefly address the issue of China’s changing demographic circumstances.
By the OGL China Team
China is already on the path of rapid aging. Like it or not, China has to welcome an era of an accelerated aging society.
China's population development will encounter several significant changes in the coming years. The seventh population census, which released its data in 2021, together with United Nations' World Population Prospects 2022, provided the data to illuminate China's future demographic development. From these changes, some phenomena that were not seen in the past observations have surfaced.
The trend toward a low birth rate and longer lifespans goes hand in hand.
The negative population growth is one of the reasons for the acceleration of the aging population in China, which is caused by the long-term trend of fewer children and longer lifespans. It is a direct manifestation of the continuous decline in fertility and mortality rates over a long period of time. In fact, 2022 is the inflection year where the natural growth rate and total population turned negative.
The improvement in the Chinese life expectancy has prompted the intensification of its aging population. In the 1950s, China’s average lifespan was around 45, but now it is 78.2 (2021). According to UN predictions, the average life expectancy for China will increase to 81 years by 2035, and to 83-84 years by 2050.
At the same time, China’s fertility rate continues to go down. In the 1950s and 1960s (except for the three-year "difficult" period from 1959 to 1961), the average family had five or six children, but by 1991 it had come down to 2.09, at the replacement level. The 2020 census indicated that each family had an average of only 1.3 children and 2022 that worsened to 1.09. In response, the government is coming up with incentives for improved and easier child care. Optimistic estimates predict the fertility rate will bounce back to an average of 1.4 children per household by 2035, and around 1.5 children by 2050.
Chinese people have never lived as long as they do today, and they will continue to live longer in the future; having children has never been as rare as it is today. Whether the future will have fewer or more births than now is a big unknown that troubles the government.
The negative growthin demographicsis presented in a sequential manner.
China’s population peaked in 2021. If viewed by age group, it has been a gradual and progressive process. First, the negative growth in children aged 0-14. In fact, the number of children reached a peak of 324 million in 1994, and then it began to decrease. Currently, it has reduced to 239 million (2022), and by 2050s, it will likely have dropped to approximately 180 million or less, according to the UN.
The second key population drop is the working age group. In 2011, the working age population (China’s current retirement age for males is 60 and for females is 55. The plan for gradually delaying the retirement age to 65 is on the way) reached its historical peak of 940 million people (number from news, unverifiable). It is now 876 million people (age 16-59, 2022), and by 2050’s, it would be approximately 650 million people.
Thirdly, the total population reached its peak in 2021 at 1.413 billion (UN est. 1.426 bil.). By 2035, it will decrease to 1.4 billion, and by 2050, it will likely decrease to 1.3 billion people.
Finally, there will be a negative growth in the elderly population. According to predictions, the elderly population aged 60 and above will reach its highest peak of 520 million in 2054.
Overall, negative population growth represents a dynamic process of demographic changes. China's population size is still massive, with over 1.4 billion people by 2035 and over 1.3 billion people by 2050. It is still one of the two world's billion-level population powers: India surpassed China in 2023, becoming the world's most populous country, according to the UN.
The transition from an aging society to anagedsociety.
The number of elderly people (65+) in 2000 accounted for 7% of the total population thus China entered the aging society. In 2021 it reached 14% (around 200 million), which marked China’s stepping into an aged society. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) defines an aging society as one where the share of people aged 65 years or older is between 7% and 14% of the total population. An aged society is when the share is between 15% and 20%, and a super-aged society is if the share is 21% or higher. According to forecasts, it is expected to exceed 20% by 2035. That is, by 2050 the number of people aged 65 and above will double from the current level. China's aging population is the world's largest, and this position will continue through the 2080s.
The UN's median scenario forecasts that the aging level will exceed 40% by the 2080s, which is a very shocking outlook. Currently, no country in the world has an aging population exceeding 40% of its population so far, but China is heading that way. Observers estimate China will be a super-aged society after 2050. It cannot find any model to follow, and it’s totally unprecedented. Yet this is not the end. If China continues to have only 1.5 children, the aging percentage will reach over 40% by the 2080s, and then slightly decrease by the end of this century. In the second half of this century, the ratio of the elderly population will account for 30% of the total population. If the fertility rate continues to decrease, the level of aging will be higher; if the fertility rate were to be higher, the number of elderly people after the 2080s would still be the same.
The characteristics of the China’s aging paradigm are complicated from some unique-to-China factors as well as some general factors facing many aging nations:
Scale: In the future, China's elderly population will reach over 400 million, ranking first in the world, because it is such a populous nation;Speed: The process of transitioning from an aging society to a moderately aged society is happening in a shorter time than in developed countries;Advanced: In the 2080s, when China's aging population broads to more than 40%, China becomes the country with the largest aging population. In the second half of this century, China's population will breakdown to 30-40% elderly, 40-50% working population, and the remaining young population would form a stable age structure, as a "stable aging society";Unbalanced: The process will also create unbalanced discrepancies between urban and rural residents, region to region, province to province. There could be significant tiered differences in demographical changes, which increase the difficulties for governments and societies to actively respond to the challenges.“Getting old before getting rich” (未富先老): China may not have the ways and means to cope with such a top heavy demographic change. Aging is constantly deepening, forming a comprehensive, long-term, and systematic impact on China’s economy and society.

Aging is a long-term change in the structure of the society
Let's take a look at the changes in two important populations. The working-age population is shrinking, but it will still remain large in the next 30 years. The working-age population is 876 million, and by 2050 it will be approximately 650 million, accounting for over 62% and 50%, respectively. Despite the reduction, China's labor supply will remain abundant in the next 30 years.
Additionally, China will experience a shift from child care to elder care as the main dependency for society. In 2022, the dependency ratio for children is 24.8% vs. elderly 21.8%,for a total of 46.6%. In the 2050s, every 100 workers will have to support 80 elderly persons, in addition to children and adolescents. The total dependency ratio will exceed 100%. By the mid 70s, the elderly dependency ratio alone will exceed 100%, and the total dependency ratio will exceed 120%. By the 2080s, the total dependency ratio could reach 140%.
Such a dependency structure will inevitably lead to an increasing contradiction between the productive and consumer populations of China's society as the paying and receiving populations of pension and medical funds, as well as the providers and recipients of elderly care services create even greater tensions. This is a very serious issue.
In addition, the urbanization of China's population continues to increase. The level of urbanization reached 65.22% in 2022. It is expected to reach 70% by 2030. In the process of urbanization, the floating population has made tremendous contributions. The total floating population in 2020 was 375.82 million, and it accounted for 26.6% of the total population in China. This is to say over a quarter of Chinese people are mobile and shifting between city clusters and industrial town centers.
In this process, the main body of migrants is young and middle-aged who are seeking employment. This has led to a phenomenon of higher aging levels in rural areas, where they used to see lower life expectancy and higher fertility rates. The result was that aging moved at a slower pace in rural areas compared to urban areas. But as of 2020, the level of the rural aging population reached 23.8%, which was 8% higher than that of urban areas, making it earlier to enter a moderately elderly society. In that sense, population mobility and urbanization are also a big factor in the future. This large-scale and long-lasting population migration and flow to cities has promoted the faster rural aging process.
China is a typical binary society with an economic development gap between urban and rural areas. The economic, institutional, and infrastructure preparations for rural aging are relatively weak. Therefore, actively responding to the changes should be at the forefront of government's focus in rural areas to ensure this 30% won’t be left to live in slums.
Changes in population size and age is one aspect of demographic transformation, but a second factor is critical as well. In the last 40 years of reform and opening up, the average life expectancy in China has increased from 68 in 1982 to now over 78 (2021). Compared with the average health level of middle-income countries, China's health level is higher, so the improvement in national health is significant.
At the same time, China is moving from a major country in labor resources to a major country in human capital. China’s education system has made rapid progress. The gross enrollment rate of higher education in China was 59.6% in 2022. The education of those 15 years old and above reached 9.9 years. The number of people who attended at or above the junior college level was over 6 million in the early stages of reform, but it has reached 220 million today, accounting for 15.5% of the total population compared to 0.6%. In 2022, the number of university graduates exceeded 10 million (reportedly with 4 million in STEM), providing a solid foundation for future human capital accumulation. Human capital is a more powerful engine of economic growth, providing new sources for high-quality and sustainable economic and social development.
Overall, population changes are the result of the demographic natural factors and China’s controversial policies in the past. When the economic and social development is not in line with the trends, it will become a problem. In China’s case, “getting old before getting rich” is a big concern for society, and government will have to come up with very creative ways to cope with it. An aged society as a whole will inevitably become more conservative and stifle creativity. China must create a mechanism that encourages innovation and incentivize flow of ideas globally.
What does this mean for business? Among others:
Consumption is about and for the people. Behind the population are demography and distribution, which helps explain target customers and where they are located.China doesn’t have a labor shortage. An inclusive education system created a large human capital population that also included women participants of more than 60% (age 15+, 2019, UN). Plus, robotics and digitization are quickly being implemented where needed.The urban generation in their post-60s is the first group that fully benefited from China’s reform and open door policy. Now they are exiting the job market with wealth, education, and higher expectations for their retirement lives. As a category, it is much underserved and less developed.Senior consumption is less than 10% of the total GDP today. The group is justified to be at least 20% if not more. The categories cross from care, leisure, education, travel, and to many more.
