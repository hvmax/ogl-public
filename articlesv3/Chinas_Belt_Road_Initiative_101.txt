### China's Belt & Road Initiative 101

11 September 2020|Belt & Road Initiative, China
AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy and, in particular, life in China. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. We have sought to advance a conversation about the U.S.-China relationship, and a deep understanding of local economic development in China. We have written a series about the strategic strength oflocal economic development in China’s 2nd and 3rd tier citiesandentrepreneurship in China today. We have also begun work on a major research project on the China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). This post begins our conversation on the BRI. – The Editorial Team
By the On Global Leadership Team
When China launched the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI, 一带一路) in 2013, the massive investment plan aimed to connect Asia, Africa, and Europe through a network of railways, ports, roads, and digital infrastructure seemed audacious, to the point of menacing. Here was China under Xi Jinping opening up its bank accounts to help countries across the globe build infrastructure, but many wondered at what cost?
Was BRI China’s version of the American Marshall Plan? Would China be like the United States in the years after World War II, rebuilding a broken world and establishing a new international order? Or would this be China’s effort to plant deep roots in the Global South to its advantage? Seven years later, it remains unclear whether BRI will strengthen China’s geopolitical position, allowing it to claim the title of the world’s most indispensable nation.
Like a sand storm in the desert or wind and waves on the sea, doubts have surrounded the BRI along the way. In China, many people question whether China will provide free funding to whatever country signs a BRI agreement, whether China is over-expanding, how will China deal with the risks. In BRI country beneficiaries, concerns are whether BRI will lead to corruption, will damage the environment, and will force them into a debt trap and lose their sovereignty.
China claims that the intention of BRI is not to modify international rules, nor will it change the existing international order. But this response has not convinced some countries, especially the United States. With the prospect of a long-term deterioration of US-China relations, some wonder whether China is promoting the BRI to ensure its geopolitical dominance or assuage the regrets of its past.
A Historic Context
When China’s Emperor Yongle died in 1424 (about 100 years after Marco Polo’s treks across Asia to Eastern China and Hangzhou), China was by far the most powerful economy in the world. The country accounted for about one-third of the global GDP, and Admiral Zheng He’s enormous fleet had maritime technology that Europe would not see for three centuries. Yet, shortly after Emperor Yongle’s death, China turned inward and Europe experienced the Renaissance and the age of mercantilism. China declined. The West rose.
Six centuries later, when President Xi Jinping came to office, it was an ambitious and propitious time. In 2013, shortly after his inauguration, Xi announced his Chinese Dream (中国梦), a plan for China to reclaim its position as one of the most powerful nations in the global political economy. Within a decade, China would become the largest economy in the world again, but there also had to be a plan that would position China as the leader of developing economic ecosystem. A key part of this plan was the BRI, an investment and development strategy that would advance economies and cultivate major trade partnerships around the world. In essence, it would recreate the trading routes of Admiral Zheng He and Marco Polo.
What is the BRI?
A massive investment plan, the BRI aims to connect Asia, Africa, and Europe through a network of railways, ports, roads and Internet infrastructure. The Belt refers to the Silk Road Economic Belt, and the Road refers to 21st Century Maritime Silk Road. China hopes to borrow the symbol of the ancient Silk Road to transform its infrastructure construction advantages in capacity, technology, and capital into new markets as well as bilateral or multilateral cooperation platforms. Additionally, it could expand into fields like cultural and people-to-people exchanges. The BRI base has changed over time, and many countries have been included in BRI initiatives that were not a part of the original BRI concept (e.g., New Zealand, Brazil).
The BRI stands out as an engagement with the world at a time when many existing multilateral efforts are facing deadlock. According the World Bank, BRI projects in all sectors that are already executed, in process, or planned are estimated to amount to USD$575 billion.
Why Did China Launch BRI?
The purported reason for the launch was to seek new markets, gain new growth momentum, and create a new pattern of opening up, one that positioned China as a leader in Southeast Asia, Africa, Europe, and Middle Asia. There is likely a deeper reason here as well: China is on the brink of becoming the largest economy in the world, yet it is still excluded from the G7 group of nations. BRI is fundamentally about China reclaiming a position as one of the influential (dominant) political economies of the global political economy. But it needs leverage. It needs soft power the same way the United States gained soft power through the Marshall Plan after WWII. Let’s look into the specifics of this plan:
New market: The 2008 financial crisis helped China realize that it will be difficult for China’s economy to grow further by relying solely on Western markets. To cope with weak external markets, China has implemented massive stimulus policies including a large-scale stimulus for infrastructure construction. Excessive capacity meant that there was a need to find another route after the completion of domestic projects. Developing new markets through BRI became a clear choice for offsetting excessive domestic capacity.
New growth momentum: China’s opening up since 1978 has exacerbated the imbalance between China’s western and eastern areas. In 2000, the Chinese government began to implement the Western Development Program (西部大开发) but not very successfully. A considerable number of BRI countries are close to China’s western border. The Chinese government hopes to give new momentum to the Western Development Program.
New opening up pattern: During the first 30 years of opening up, China mainly focused on developed countries. While most BRI countries are developing countries, BRI is the Chinese version of global rebalancing. China’s eyes are no longer just focused on Western countries. The BRI provides new support for South-South cooperation (南南合作) among developing countries, and China is positioning itself to become the leader of the Global South, the leader of the developing world.

Which Countries are Included in the BRI?
China has presented the BRI as an open platform in which all countries can participate. However, there is no official list of participating countries. Below are our classifications of the BRI countries:
There are 66 countries along the Belt and Road based reports from the Xinhua News Agency: China, Mongolia, Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, Brunei, Philippines, Iran, Iraq, Turkey, Syria, Jordan, Lebanon, Israel, Palestine, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Oman, UAE, Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain, Greece, Cyprus, Egypt, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Afghanistan, Sri Lanka, Maldives, Nepal, Bhutan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Georgia, Azerbaijan, Armenia, Moldova, Poland, Lithuania, Estonia, Latvia, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, Serbia, Albania, Romania, Bulgaria, and Macedonia.
In the political and economic sense, countries that have signed the BRI bilateral cooperation documents with China can all be classified as the BRI countries. Based on media reports, as of January 2020, China has signed BRI cooperation documents with 138 countries including Italy, New Zealand, Argentina and a large number of African countries.
How does China Implement BRI?
Although China has been trading and investing with the BRI countries for some time, the Chinese government has taken a “learning by doing” approach when implementing the BRI. It is an international version of the famous "Crossing the River by Feeling for Stones(摸着石头过河) methodology China used in domestic reform and opening up 40 years ago. China implements BRI mainly through projects in the framework of bilateral rather than multilateral agreements. In China, governments at different levels, state-owned enterprises. and private enterprises have their own roles to play.
Top leaders promote:Top leaders of China push hard with other countries to reach BRI consensus and sign BRI documents like agreements or memorandum of understanding.
Ministries outline: Once BRI documents are signed, ministries work with BRI countries to jointly identify projects, formulate high level action plans, resolve issues, and provide necessary support for the execution of projects.
State-owned enterprises pioneer:Infrastructure construction is the strength of China’s state-owned enterprises (SOE), especially central SOEs. With a strong competitive advantage and international experience in industries like high-speed rail, nuclear power, and communications technology, China's central enterprises are pioneers and the driving force in the implementation of the BRI.
Private enterprises follow:Private enterprises have a keen market sense and will naturally not let business opportunities go, but they are typically reluctant to make the first move. The shift of the supply chain triggered by the US-China trade war has accelerated the development of private enterprises to invest in BRI countries, especially in Southeast Asia. The characteristic of private enterprises is to follow the footsteps of the winners and go out in a group, they are more suitable for the industrial park model.
Is China Santa Claus?
Chinese people worry that the Chinese government will give away BRI funds that could have been used in China. Such concerns seem overly anxious if people understood the western criticism that BRI is putting some low-income countries into a “debt trap”. In 2017, the Chinese government announced that over the next three years, it would provide non-reimbursable assistance and interest-free loans totaling 60 billion RMB (USD$9.2 billion) to developing countries and international organizations participating in the BRI, an amount significantly less than the total amount of BRI investments projected by the World Bank. As there is little detailed information available, Chinese people have a reason to worry because there are still some 600 million people in China whose monthly income is barely 1,000 yuan (USD$141). The Chinese government's answer is that promoting the BRI will rely on enterprises through market-oriented operation.
What are the Risks of BRI Projects?
Lots of research and discussions have identified risks associated with the BRI projects. We have summarized representative opinions in the following chart.
Different parties have their own concerns. For Chinese companies involved in BRI projects, regardless of state-owned or private, risks related to human resources and markets are at the top of mind. Think tanks and academic researchers focus more on risks at the macro level. For the World Bank, the BRI reflects the risks common to many major infrastructure projects.
What Chinese Private Companies Participating in the BRI Say
From April to July 2019, a survey was conducted of China's private companies participating in the BRI by The All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce (ACFIC). A total of 530 valid answers were collected, covering Southeast Asia, South Asia, Central and Eastern Europe, Africa, the Middle East, Central Asia, and West Asia. Key findings of the survey include:
Operating conditions
- 62.1% of the surveyed companies believe their operations are relatively smooth.
- 83.2% have confidence in their future overseas development.
- 54.5% produce products or services only for the local market, and 35.3% for other countries.
- 23.4% say their overseas business accounts for more than 50% of the total business volume.
Employee relations
- For 55.3% of the surveyed companies, local employee number exceeds 50% of total employees. However, 29.2% of the surveyed companies say Chinese employee ratio exceeds 50%.
- 49.1% have met problems like "obstacles in getting along and communicating with local employees due to cultural differences."
- 29.1% reported that "differences in ethnic religion, living habits, and cultural customs have affected local employees in their routine working activities."
- Negative reports in local media about Chinese companies, topics that surveyed companies have the highest perception are “Most Chinese companies hire Chinese workers and do not bring actual benefits to local people" and "despoiling of local resources,” 38.8 % and 37.8% respectively.
Perception of risk
- From country perspective, Myanmar, Laos, Cambodia, Mongolia, and India are scored with higher risk.
- Factors with the highest risk level are: human resources, macro economics, and weak industrial foundation.
- Social security risks are not as serious as expected. The threat of terrorism and armed conflicts are rarely mentioned. Public security issues such as theft and robbery (16.6%) and criminal infringements (12.1%) occasionally occur.
Up to now, enterprises have been the main force for implementing BRI. Before participating in BRI projects, Chinese companies must first consider market opportunity, financial returns, and their capabilities. In order to minimize the risk and uncertainty in international operations, it is very important to conduct due diligence, formulate operation plans based on the characteristics of the target country, and specific industry. For small and medium-sized enterprises, participating in groups has been a good idea.
What are the Success Stories of the BRI?
There have already been a few BRI projects that have been successful in both their development and rollout, according to Chinese media:
Jushi Egypt: Located in an industrial zone in the Ain Sokhna district of Suez province east of the capital Cairo, Jushi Egypt is the largest Chinese manufacturing project in Egypt with an investment of more than USD$600 million. It has an annual production output of 200,000 tons of fiberglass and an annual export of USD$200 million. Jushi Egypt has created more than 2,000 jobs for Egypt, more than 66% of the company's middle-level managers and 99% of frontline workers are local people. The developer of the industrial zone is also a Chinese company.
The Mombasa-Nairobi Standard Gauge Railway (SGR): SGR was inaugurated on 1 June, 2017, connecting the port city Mombasa in eastern Kenya with the capital Nairobi in the interior. SGR is over 480 kilometers long, with a total investment of USD$3.8 billion. It is reported that SGR has created more than 46,000 jobs for Kenya and contributed 1.5% to the country’s GDP growth. However, Kenyan feelings about  SGR are much more complicated. This is a benchmark project of the current President Uhuru Kenyatta, and it has been criticized by some people as “the Jubilee government's pet project.” In June 2020, he situation got more complicated when the Court of Appeal ruled that the engagement of China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC) as the contractor for the railway project amounted to a violation of the Constitution of Kenya.
Other hot cases include: China–Pakistan Economic Corridor, Sirajganj Power Plant in Bangladesh, China - Laos Railway, Hungary-Serbia Railway etc.
All has not gone smoothly with BRI investments in every country. There have been public protests in some nations over China’s human rights record and complaints about corruption in others, yet BRI remains a remarkable tool for China to build its global geopolitical footprint and to return to the vision of storied Emperor Yongle.
