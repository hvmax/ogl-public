### Zhenjiang: More on Local Governments as Industrial Firms

22 January 2024|China, China history, China politics, Economic Development, Trade
AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy and, in particular, life in China. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. We have sought to advance a conversation about the U.S.-China relationship, and a deep understanding of local economic development in China. We have written a series about the strategic strength oflocal economic development in China’s 2nd and 3rd tier citiesandentrepreneurship in China today. These case studies are part of a larger project in which we report on the strength of China’s economic development model (e.g.,hereandhere). Our focus in these posts are on the Chinese theory of economic development – what Andrew Walder has called “local governments as industrial firms” – and on examples of local leaders operating in this practice of development. In many ways, these local leaders are the hidden heroes of China’s economic development prowess. This post adds to that conversation.
On a recent research trip to China (Doug Guthrie’s first time back in the country in four, long, and COVID-embargoed years), the OGL research team hit the interview circuit again, looking to find more stories and deeper confirmation of where China sits in its development stage. These are turbulent times economically, and 2023 was a monumental year for the world’s second-largest economy, as we have written previously.
We saw President Biden fly to Bali to meet with President Xi at the 2022 G-20 Meeting; we saw Xi broker the Iran-Saudi Peace Deal; we saw Secretaries Blinken, Yellen, and Raimondo make high-profile visits to China; we saw the sudden rearranging of the BRICS bloc, further solidifying China’s self-proclaimed position as leader of the Global South; and we saw Xi make the trek to meet with President Biden at the 2023 APEC Meeting in San Francisco. Given all of this, we were anxious to get out into the field to test our thesis about China’s strong economy resulting from innovation at the municipal level.
So, we went out to two prefecture-level cities in Jiangsu Province, Zhenjiang and Changzhou, “small” 3rd Tier Cities with populations of about 3 and 5 million, respectively. The cities sit in the middle of Jiangsu Province about halfway between Shanghai and Nanjing. There we met with a leader of the Zhenjiang Bureau of Commerce, listening to him wax eloquent about the city's project management system, the ways in which his Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are tied to innovation, and the future of economic development in Jiangsu and in China. These cities are considerably smaller and less well-known than highly regarded Chinese cities like Shanghai, Shenzhen, and Zhengzhou. But they are every bit as important as engines of China’s dramatic economic transformation and its continued growth for years and decades to come.
These interviews provided wonderful data, both reaffirming all our views about the strength of China’s corporate structure and providing insight into the ways in which China continues to push the boundaries of development beyond a deep cheap labor pool into the area of innovation in the manufacturing supply chain across the country. In the Changzhou interview, we listened to the ways in which this city became a powerhouse in the Electric Vehicle (EV) space. In Zhenjiang, we listened to ways in which the city divides up industrial projects, monitoring the performance of local officials who are put in charge of managing each project. We also learned that Zhenjiang has been a Sister City of Tempe, Arizona, the home of Arizona State University, where one of us (Guthrie) sits on the faculty. We listened to the Director’s enthusiastic pitch for how we might all collaborate on teaching and learning about leadership development and innovation in the City of Zhenjiang. It was a fascinating interview, to say the least.
Let’s once again unpack this dynamic interaction of national development goals and the pressures faced, and actions taken by little cities like Zhenjiang, through the lens of Andrew Walder’s (1995) concept of local governments as industrial firms. Economic development in China is fundamentally shaped by government guidance and centralized control. This has been true since the beginning of the economic reforms (and during the Communist Era as well). However, while we often think of the Chinese government as the authoritarian, protectionist, centralized party in Beijing, that is only one side of the government. In reality, local governments are the engines driving China’s growth. Indeed, the Chinese government is an extremely decentralized and entrepreneurial system of district and township governments. The mayors of China’s districts, townships, and villages behave like corporate CEOs, focusing on KPIs, pursuing foreign investment, and advancing their own careers through the financial and economic achievements in their districts and townships. But they don’t do it alone – they do it through close coordination with China’s private sector and with foreign investors from abroad. Companies like Tencent, Alibaba, and Huawei, but also Apple, GM, Boeing, and Microsoft have worked closely with these local governments to drive a phenomenon of local state competition. What the Chinese have discovered is that private property is not the cornerstone of capitalism, as economists have long thought – local competition is. Thus, while rapid privatization programs were unleashed on the former Soviet Bloc, China carefully set in place a balance between state control and local state incentives. It then mixed this balance with enough autonomy for local governments to go out and recruit partners from the private sector and abroad. It has allowed China to build the most dynamic manufacturing supply chain in the world. And it has allowed China to quietly become one of the most innovative economies in the world. Through our analyses of cases that range from Tier 1 cities like Shanghai, Hangzhou, and Shenzhen to Tier 2, 3, and 4 cities like Changzhou, Zhenjiang, Nantong, Guiyang, and many others, we analyze how local governments are creating the framework for a new economic landscape in China.
Economic development in China is fundamentally shaped by government guidance and centralized control. There is a lot of strategic planning going on in five-year plans, 10-year plans, and 20-year plans. This has been true since the start of economic reforms and during the Mao Era as well. While we often think of the Chinese government as an authoritarian, protectionist, and centralized party in Beijing, that is only one side of the government. In practice, local governments are the true engines driving China’s growth. Indeed, the Chinese government is an extremely decentralized and entrepreneurial system of district and township governments. The mayors of China’s districts, townships, and villages behave like corporate CEOs, focusing on Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), pursuing foreign investment, and advancing their own careers through the financial and economic achievements in their districts and townships.
But local governments don’t do it alone. They do it through close coordination with China’s private sector and with foreign investors from abroad. Companies like Tencent, Alibaba, and Huawei are partners, of course, but also Apple, GM, Boeing, and Microsoft have worked closely with these local governments to drive local state competition. And they work to choose areas to build industrial clusters. What the Chinese have discovered is that private property is not the cornerstone of capitalism, as economists have long thought – local competition is. Thus, while rapid privatization programs were unleashed on the former Soviet Bloc, China carefully set in place a balance between state control and local incentives. It then mixes this balance with enough autonomy for local governments to go out and recruit partners from the private sector and abroad to build industrial clusters that build their local economies.
Director Yu and the Case of Zhenjiang
Zhenjiang is a Third-Tier city in Jiangsu Province. The city lies between Nanjing, the provincial capital of Jiangsu, and Shanghai, China's economic center, which sits 250 kilometers East of Zhenjiang.
Historically, the city is perhaps best known to the world as the childhood home of Nobel Prize laureate Pearl S. Buck, author ofThe Good Earth. Zhenjiang is also known for building and managing industrial clusters that feed into the production of automobiles, high-end equipment manufacturing, medical equipment, and the digital economy, among others.
On January 2, 2024, the first working day of the new year, Zhenjiang International Investment Promotion Center held a meeting to review the work in 2023 and deploy plans for 2024. The meeting was chaired by Yu Jun, a member of the leadership team of Zhenjiang Municipal Bureau of Commerce, Yu oversees investment promotion (1). Three weeks ago, we were received by Mr. Yu when visiting Zhenjiang Municipal Bureau of Commerce, he shared with us general information of Zhenjiang and how the city promotes investment. Yu was in a good mood during our meeting because his KPIs for 2023 had been completed.
Investment promotion is essentially the sales of business environment by local governments, mainly manifested in the form of persuading investors to acquire land or lease buildings. To quote Mr. Yu, attracting project investments for industry development is the “source of running water (for the local economy),” “the number one project (of government)” and “the origin of tax revenue.”
In the 2023 government work report, Xu Shuhai, the mayor of Zhenjiang, sought to "Concentrate on building a solid industrial foundation and maintaining steady economic growth” in the first place among eight action items to achieve the economic and social development goals of the city in 2023. Xu emphasized that it is critical to expand effective investment and achieve breakthroughs in project attraction, construction, quality, and efficiency. The mayor set the goal of the total investment of newly signed major industrial projects (a project with total investment surpasses ￥100 million) to exceed ￥150 billion, and he made specific assignments to districts and counties, i.e.,￥38 billion for Zhenjiang New District, ￥33 billion for Danyang City and ￥20 billion for Jurong City.
The setting of annual investment attraction targets is similar to the setting of sales goals in private enterprises. After lower-level departments (such as districts and counties) put forward their plans according to the overall targets of the city and the specific conditions of each region, the final targets are decided by the higher-level government organizations after trade-offs and bargaining back and forth up and down the administrative hierarchy.
The 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-2025) of Zhenjiang City, finalized at the end of 2020, proposes that the key to Zhenjiang's development in the next five years is to build 8 supply chain clusters in 4 industry sectors (abbreviated as 4 industry sectors and 8 clusters四群八链). Figure 3 illustrates what exactly are these clusters and industry sectors, focused area within a cluster, responsible municipal bureaus and districts/countries. To make good use of Zhenjiang's limited financial resources, investment promotion is carried out around these clusters and sectors.
Let us look, for example, at the case of the automobiles (new energy vehicles) and the parts industry cluster to illustrate how investment promotion works are carried out across the city. The Municipal Bureau of Commerce, where Mr. Yu works, acts as the facilitator and coordinator for the automobiles and parts – new energy vehicles – cluster, a role equivalent to the business development manager for a specific product category in a corporation. Investment promotion starts with a complete landscape analysis of the industry and gap analysis, finding out focused development areas and major players in the market, which can be either domestic or foreign companies, and then carrying out targeted promotion activities. Districts and counties are the undertaking units of investment projects, each having its own development focus based on strength and endowments. Developing automobiles and parts (new energy vehicles) industry will mainly rely on Danyang City, Zhenjiang Economic Development Zone, Dantu District and Yangzhong City. The investment promotion staff from the Bureau of Commerce works in these districts and counties, an arrangement called seamless integration.
Director Yu is an official who knows his business, and he has taken action at the opening of 2024 to set the tone moving forward. In the work meeting, Director Yu requested the following of his investment promotion staff:
Be persistent and resilient；Maintain seamless cooperation with relevant departments, districts, and counties, and provide every possible service to ensure project implementation；Keep abreast of economic development and industry dynamics;Actively visit business associations, industrial funds, and leading enterprises to establish effective contacts and broaden the channels of project information sources.
• Be persistent and resilient；
• Maintain seamless cooperation with relevant departments, districts, and counties, and provide every possible service to ensure project implementation；
• Keep abreast of economic development and industry dynamics;
• Actively visit business associations, industrial funds, and leading enterprises to establish effective contacts and broaden the channels of project information sources.
The Director also emphasizes careful mapping and analysis of the functional components that make up the industrial clusters for which he is responsible in Zhenjiang. As Figure 5 shows, the team has adopted the practice of providing detailed analyses of the functional organization of a given industrial cluster, including details of which areas must be prioritized in the immediate future. The key point here is that this is not a Friedman-esque, Neoclassical Economic approach of letting the market decide how this industrial cluster will emerge. This is Director Yu playing a key leadership role in the building of Zhenjiang Automobile and Parts Industrial Cluster.
With the increased competition among regions, traditional ways to promote investment like financial subsidies, preferential policies, and hospitality are becoming less effective and sustainable. The business environment and the professional competence of government officials have become new dimensions of competition between regions, and this is exactly what officials in Zhenjiang like Director Yu and his colleagues are working hard to improve.
According to Director Yu, there is no crystal ball for investment promotion, only professionalism, persistence, and a little luck. As Director Yu’s work shows, leadership in the investment promotion area requires detailed organization and planning, building out the functional structure of the industrial cluster, making explicit which areas are priorities and which are secondary, etc. The cases of local economic development in China’s cities serve as wonderful examples of leadership, entrepreneurial management, and an enduring economic development logic playing out at the local level. In short, they are prime examples of Andrew Walder’s (1995) notion of “local governments as industrial firms.”
