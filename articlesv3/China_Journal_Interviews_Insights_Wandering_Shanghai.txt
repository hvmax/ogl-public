### China Journal: Interviews, Insights & Wandering Shanghai

14 December 2023|China, China history, China politics
AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide analyses about leadership in the global economy. In this post, Dr. Doug Guthrie, who is a co-founder of OGL, continues to curate a special series of China Journal entries over the next two weeks as he returns to China for the first time in four years. In this post, Dr. Guthrie discusses some of the fascinating interviews and company visits he experienced during his trip, and some of the insights he gleaned from these conversations.
Originally, I had a lofty goal of journaling every day while in China. Unfortunately, with a very busy schedule, a lot of emotion, and the need to balance meetings back in the U.S., time got away from me. Instead, I decided to roll up my final days in a several posts to capture this wonderful trip back to China.
To briefly restate some of the key issues that I have raised in previous posts:
·  This was an emotional trip for me for several reasons. Much of my identity is tied up with being a China scholar -- a scholar who is inextricably linked to face-to-face and boots-on-the-ground experiences. Rather than bury myself in library stacks or immersing myself in data sets that tell macrolevel stories of the economy, I would much rather talk to actors in the economy, piecing together the extent to which their own experiences reveal a deeper or more nuanced story of what is actually going on in the economy. Needless to say, this type of ethnographic interviewing requires the researcher spend time talking to people in the political economy. If you are not there, you can’t do the research. So, needless to say, this return trip – my first time in China in four years – was built up in my mind as re-establishing my on-the-ground credibility.
·  Several amazing interviews brought with them impactful insights. The in-China On Global Leadership partners did a terrific job tracking down fascinating people who were able articulate their experiences in the current economic environment. Interviews with business leaders working in the high-tech AI economy showcased how China will take a deeper and stronger leadership role in this market going forward.
·  Fundamentally, we believe that history and culture matter. If you are going to be an effective businessperson or an effective analyst, you must begin with an appreciation for and knowledge of a nation's history. But you also must be a relentless analyst of geopolitics and local political economies. As researchers and analysts, we learn so much from hearing the voices of individuals in these markets.
We continued our interviews with a visit to the headquarters of Dow Chemical in China. This interview was exciting for me for very personal reasons. Three decades ago, when I was conducting my dissertation research, I narrowed my study to a manageable sampling frame by focusing on four sectors – garments, food, electronics, and chemicals. My study was on Chinese State-Owned Enterprises that were seeking to attract investment from and partnership with foreign multinationals in order to learn from these global corporations. In the chemicals sector in Shanghai, Dow Chemicals loomed large.
Every firm I studied in Shanghai’s chemicals sector dreamed of a joint venture or some other kind of partnership with Dow. Back then I was too young and inexperienced to land an interview with Dow executives. So, when one of my China-based OGL partners, Diane Long, leveraged her connections in the market to set up an interview with Dow, it felt like a beautiful process of coming full circle in my research.
On one of the days when we didn’t have any formal interviews scheduled, we got in the car and drove out to the new Huawei Shanghai Research Center, which is being built in the western part of Shanghai. Huawei is an amazing company, the most powerful of China’s private companies and truly a leader in Chinese innovation. Recently, the company has been building a Research Center in Western Shanghai. It will be fascinating to observe and continue to chart the powerful role this remarkable company will play in continued technological innovation in China. And it is fascinating to see the ways in which it is continuing to build its presence across China.
And, when we weren’t in interviews or driving out to the Huawei Research Center, we did what all good scholars should do: we just walked the streets. We went to Nanjing West Road, a famous consumer hotspot in Shanghai, (See Figure 8) where part of Shanghai’s famous Nanjing West Road is closed to traffic so that consumers can just wander through new consumer stores, not confined to narrow sidewalks but free to amble down the middle of the street wandering from Nike to Huawei to Decathlon (See Figure 9) and, of course, the largest Starbucks in the world (See Figure 10). It is not just large, but it is also a beautiful store.
Then we went to Anfu Road. I lived in this neighborhood thirty years ago, so I was quite familiar with the area. It is not a fancy part of Shanghai like Nanjing West Road, but it has become a famous location in Shanghai of late. This was the site where the COVID anti-lockdown demonstration took place. And in the last year, it has become a location where Shanghai’s alternative community come to walk. It is not uncommon to see cross-dressing Chinese men and women walking this street. And as many locals are lured by what they might see, this small, nondescript Shanghai Street is filled with crowds of observers waiting to observe individuals who are pushing the boundaries of the still-relatively-conservative Shanghai society.
Visiting Changzhou
On Tuesday of last week, we went out to Changzhou and Zhenjiang, both 3rd Tier cities in Jiangsu Province. These cities lie a couple of hours West of Shanghai, closer to Nanjing than to Shanghai. In studying the Chinese economy, it is important to get out of the major metropolitan areas like Shanghai, Beijing, Chongqing, Shenzhen, etc., and hear the voices of the economic actors in smaller cities.
In Changzhou, we visited the SGS headquarters in China. SGS is a Swiss multinational corporation that is one of the leading corporations in the world on testing, inspection, and certification. Organizations like SGS play a crucial role in China’s dominant role as exporter to the world. It is one thing to harness a massive labor force and build a sophisticated manufacturing supply chain that is the leading exporter of products to the world. But someone has to ensure that the products in these containers of goods leaving China for markets around the world meet international standards. It is all fine and good to have millions of shirts produced cheaply and efficiently in China to be sold in WalMart stores across America, but how do we know that the threads in the underlying textiles are chemically treated in the right way?
This is the important work that SGS does. We had a fascinating conversation with the Head of Research for SGS in Changzhou. It was a wonderful conversation, as it danced between economic development in China and China’s continuing strong position in global trade on the one hand and then how organizations like SGS can train its workforce to be innovative and be creative leaders in the industries they serve. It was a perfect conversation for the On Global Leadership team.
Visiting Zhenjiang
We left Changzhou and drove directly to Zhenjiang, a 3rd Tier Chinese city that has developed a strong manufacturing position in several industries, including automobile component manufacturing. There we met with the Director of Changjiang’s Bureau of Commerce. We have written a good amount about Professor Andrew Walder’s concept oflocal governments as industrial firms. The core concept in Walder’s thesis is that local governments are not just the regulators of their local economies, they are participants, they are project managers. They have Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), and they are held accountable for ensuring that the firms under their management are contributing to the economic development the municipal government has laid out. The interview was fascinating on a number of levels.
First, Director Yu serves as the project manager for Zhenjiang’s automobile sector, and, in speaking of the 2023 performance of this sector, he spoke like a corporate executive. He talked about his KPIs and talked about how important it is to hit your KPIs as early as possible – in his case, when we were with him on December 12, he gleefully disclosed that he had already hit his KPIs for the year and so would be able to relax a bit and coast to the end of the year.
Also at the meeting was Ms. Liu, Director of Zhenjiang’s International Business Promotion Center in the Bureau of Commerce. They asked us a lot about Thunderbird and Arizona State University (ASU), showing that they were knowledgeable about ASU at a level of depth that surprised me. As it turns out, Zhenjiang has been a formal Sister City of Tempe, Arizona, which is the home of ASU’s main campus, since 1989. In a truly entrepreneurial fashion, our hosts encouraged further conversations and exploration of how we all might work together.
One additional interesting Zhenjiang tidbit: Nobel Prize winning author ofThe Good Earth, Pearl S. Buck, grew up in Zhenjiang, spending most of her young life there before moving back to the United States in 1934. Buck wouldn't even recognize the city today.
Finally, a few photos from our wonderful time wandering the streets of Shanghai.
