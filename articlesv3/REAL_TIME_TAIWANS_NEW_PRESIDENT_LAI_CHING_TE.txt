25 May 2024|China, China politics, US-China Relations
On Global Leadership’s regular feature OGL Real Time presents our up-to-the-minute insights on current news and events. We hope these breaking news insights from our OGL team members will help illuminate the events of the day and provide the depth needed to understand global political, economic, and cultural transitions and transformations. In this post, we reflect on the inauguration of Taiwan’s new President Lai Ching-Te, which occurred May 20, 2024. In this post, we consider the implications of President Lai’s election as well as the comments he made in his inaugural address. We examine a variety of important issues raised by this announcement, taking into account our own views as well as what the OGL team in China sees in local media, social media and popular sentiment.
Before we begin our Real Time analysis of China-Taiwan relations at this point, we thought it might be helpful to provide this brief history.
There are many milestones in the China-Taiwan relationship, and it might help to give China watchers a sense of just how complicated this history is. It is too often the case that we find ourselves in conversations with American executives and students who express  strong opinions about Taiwan’s longstanding “right” to independence, often voicing these opinions without significant historical context.
The China State Council’s contention that Taiwan “has been an inalienable part of China since ancient times” is not incorrect. The small island off the coast of Fujian Province has been associated the Chinese Mainland for more than a millennium. The history has been complicated in the last century, dating back to China’s conflicts with an imperialist Japan, which really began with the Sino-Japanese War of 1895. As a result of that conflict, Japan occupied Taiwan essentially until the end of WWII.
The Chinese Civil War pitted Chiang Kai-shek’s Nationalist (KMT)  against Mao Zedong’s Communist forces. When Mao’s CCP army defeated Chiang Kai-shek’s Republic of China (ROC) forces in 1949, the latter retreated to Taiwan to regroup. In the following decades, as China struggled to bring order the nation -- following its Century of Humiliation, which included two Opium Wars, the Sino-Japanese War, the fall of Imperial China, the Warlord Period and then the Communist Revolution -- the ROC’s occupation of Taiwan was somewhat ignored  after its defeat in the Communist Revolution.
The U.S. military developed a renewed interest in the island – and, by extension, the ROC – as a key strategic outpost for the fighting on the Korea peninsula at the dawn of the Korean War in 1954. So, the island’s last century is definitely complicated, but the Chinese State Council’s contention that Taiwan has long been a part of China is not incorrect.
The late-1950s through the mid-1970s were difficult times for Mainland China, as it struggled with the famine, when some 30 million citizens died of starvation between 1958 to 196; and the catastrophic effects of Mao’s Cultural Revolution, launched in 1966 and lasting until his death in 1976. During this time, as the Mainland struggled, Taiwan, under the leadership of the ROC, developed and thrived, experiencing dramatic economic development, and playing a key role in East Asian economic development. Later, as scholars studied the economic transformation of East Asia, the island would join a group that would later be nicknamed by Asian scholars as the four Asian tigers (with South Korea, Hong Kong, and Singapore).
Often the narrative is that the U.S. has long defended Taiwan’s right to independence, in part, because this was part of the Cold War ideology: capitalist democracy versus communist authoritarianism. This notion is only partially accurate. While Mao Zedong’s PRC Revolution was clearly communist authoritarianism, it is inaccurate to think of Chiang Kai-shek’s army as fighting for capitalist democracy; capitalist yes, democracy, not at all. After the ROC army fled to Taiwan following its defeat in 1949, it ruled the island as an authoritarian dictatorship for the next 40 years. Indeed, the island was ruled by the ROC government under martial law for the first thirty-eight years of the ROC’s occupation there. Observers will remember Taiwan in 1989 when the Democratic Progressive Party was emerging as an alternative to the Nationalist Party. It was an exciting time of democratic awakening and fascinating to observe, but this is relatively recent history.
A key turning point came in 1979, when Deng Xiaoping and U.S. President Jimmy Carter signed the normalization of U.S.-China relations agreement during Deng’s visit to the United States. The U.S.-PRC Joint Communiqué established official diplomatic ties, stating, the “Government of the United States of America acknowledges the Chinese position that there is one China and Taiwan is part of China.” Immediately thereafter, the U.S. Congress passed the Taiwan Relations Act (H.R. 2479, 96th Congress), committing the United States to selling arms to Taiwan. Since 1979, various dynamics have defined and redefined U.S.-China-Taiwan relations. However, one thing has been clear: there is one China and Taiwan is a part of China.
1. Is the election of Lai Ching-Te an important milestone for cross-strait China-Taiwan relations?
The short answer is, yes, thiscouldbecome an important milestone for cross-strait relations, especially if President Lai does not change course. Our view is that China will not back away from this issue. If President Lai continues his unmoderated language that signals a conclusion of Taiwanese independence or two-state relations, China will not let the issue go and a military outcome will be inevitable.
As we write this, OGL team members Chris Gao and Doug Guthrie are in Zhengzhou visiting this important Chinese city and conducting interviews with officials of Zhengzhou’s Department of Commerce. Zhengzhou is the home of the Taiwan manufacturing powerhouse Foxconn, Taiwan’s largest Mainland Chinese investment. Taiwan’s presence – and the collaborative engagement between China and Taiwan – always looms in the background. On May 22, CGTN was awash with news of Lai Ching-Te’s inaugural speech. The tension in the China-Taiwan relationship as well as the growing tensions in the U.S.-China relationship loom ominously in the background. On May 23, CGTN was nonstop reporting on the military drills around Taiwan. If there was any question about China simply ignoring Lai’s statements or brushing the issue aside, China’s intentions are clear now.
Over the last four decades since the normalization of U.S.-China relations, the Mainland and Taiwan have become more closely intertwined economically. Taiwan has continued to develop its own internal political system, eventually developing into a multiparty-political electoral system. Today, Taiwan is a democracy, led by a president and parliament that are selected in multiparty election, and there are two main parties, the Chinese Nationalist Party and the Democratic Progressive Party. President Lai Ching-Te is a member of the Democratic Progressive Party.
With his recent inaugural address, President Lai seemed to strike a peaceful tone, stating that Taiwan does not seek independence from China, but, at the same time, implied that Taiwan is already a sovereign nation (PBS). China has abided and will continue to abide by the notion of “one country, two systems." However, China will not allow for the suggestion or notion that Taiwan is already an independent nation.
2. What are people in China saying about Lai’s election, and, in particular, about his inaugural address.
President Lai's inaugural speech has been described as "the most Taiwan independent advocacy ever". Although he did not use the words "Taiwan Independence ", Lai said that "the Republic of China Taiwan is a sovereign, independent nation" and "the Republic of China and the People's Republic of China are not subordinate to each other". This speech is described by Chinese netizen as a "Taiwan independence manifesto". Lai used China for mainland, while his predecessor Tsai Ing wen used "the other side of the strait" or "Beijing authority" in her two inaugural speeches in 2016 and 2020, a tone that was firm but soft.
Beijing has not hidden its anger at Lai. Foreign Minister Wang Yi said “the ugly acts of Lai Ching-te and others who betray the nation and their ancestors are contemptible（赖清德之流背叛民族和祖先的丑行令人不齿). Beijing has no honeymoon period for Lai, and has immediately responded. On May 23, 2024, the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) and the China Coast Guard (CCG) launched a two-day Joint Sword-2024A drills as a punishment for Lai's  separatist acts. Comparing the military-exercise zones of the previous drills, the Joint Sword-2024A covered wider geographic areas, including four outlying islands, but at the same time, the encirclement on the main island of Taiwan became tighter.
On social media, there were many calls to "give up illusions and be prepared for fighting (放弃幻想, 准备斗争)," so much so that bloggers with official media backgrounds have come forward to explain why the Mainland can't immediately use force against Taiwan. But "the Taiwan issue must be resolved, yet it should be carried out in a way that is relatively less risky and costly to the nation, rather than blindly acting recklessly…” Ironically, Lai’s speech or a written speech text has not been seen in any Chinese official media.
3. Is a conflict over Taiwan inevitable?
A conflict over Taiwan is not inevitable, but it depends heavily on the moves that are made on the Taiwan side in the coming weeks and months. In the immediate term, we believe that Beijing will allow for a détente – a continuation of the one-country-two-systems approach to the world. However, if President Lai continues with rhetoric that states directly or even implies that Taiwan is already an independent nation, a conflict will be inevitable. It is also our view that Beijing will seek to put an end to the ambiguity over Taiwan’s nationhood status within the next decade. Our own counsel would be for the U.S. government to take a proactive approach to engagement and negotiation with Beijing over the issue. In sum, conflict is not inescapable, but both sides have incentives to find a resolution in the outcome.
4. What do people in China think about TSMC's evolution as a global corporation? In particular, what do people think about TSMC building a significant presence in the United States?
The achievements and industry status of TSMC are well recognized here. Being the world’s largest dedicated foundries with fabrication facilities (“fabs”), TSMC manufactures chips using the most advanced process technology such as 5nm, 3nm and even 2nm, maintaining its technological leadership in the industry. Its products are widely used in smart phones, computers, AI and other fields, and it has established solid business relations with many well-known technology companies around the world.
The success of TSMC in surpassing the U.S. fab capability has given Chinese chip companies confidence and motivation to narrow the gap with international giants. The Kirin 9000S chip used in Huawei's Mate60 phone is an example of China's recent progress.
The fact TSMC is building a factory in Phoenix, Arizona, has not caused a stir on Chinese social media. Under the restrictions imposed by the U.S. government on China, the Arizona fab will not be allowed to sell products to Chinese companies. Chinese netizens do gather together for news on the cultural clashes, delays in construction schedules, safety incidents, and the huge subsidies from the U.S. government. However, flashing back to 2021, there was a debate about whether China's local government should provide preferential conditions to support TSMC's Nanjing factory to expand the capacity of 28nm chips. The typical objection was that the intention of TSMC expansion was to squeeze China's emerging chip makers by dumping low price chips. Compared to TSMC Arizona’s most advanced chips with 5nm and above, the heat of the conversation is a different level of magnitude.
Some think TSMC Arizona will hollow out Taiwan’s fab capability, and it will make Taiwan less important to the United States and for the U.S. to defend. But a similar mistake would be  China’s “invading” Taiwan to secure the chip making capability.
5. Are there ways to imagine a reconciliation between China and Taiwan?
The reality of cross-strait relations is:
Mainstream public opinion in Taiwan is not to be reunited with the Mainland; the typical view on the Mainland is that Taiwan must be reunified.If it were not for the Mainland, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) authorities would have declared independence. Beijing could and likely would take action against Taiwan at any time if the U.S. factor were not considered.If Taiwan were allowed to become independent, as Outer Mongolia did in the 20th Century, the CPC would lose its legitimacy and risk encouraging more separatist activities.The final settlement of the Taiwan issue depends on a contest of strength between China and the United States, especially influenced by the internal politics of the two countries. If an armed conflict breaks out between China and the United States over Taiwan, the cost of failure will be unbearable for either side. As we have emphasized in other posts, the world’s two largest economies are so deeply intertwined and interdependent that it would be devastating for both countries if a war were to break out. If it was suddenly the case that some of the world’s most profitable and most innovative companies were suddenly no longer allowed to operate in China, the consequences for global capital markets would be devastating.

We have made the following forecast on the trend of cross-strait relations over time:
Short-term (now to 2027)- Beijing will not take the initiative if the United States and Taiwan do not take drastic actions, such as declaring independence, establishing an open official relationship between the United States and Taiwan, etc. At this stage, maintaining political ambiguity, e.g. the 1992 Consensus or the Constitution of the Republic of China seems to be a feasible way for cross-strait reconciliation.Medium-term (2028 to 2035)- If China can keep making progress toward its 2035 goals, i.e., surpass the United States in nominal GDP and become self-sufficient in key technologies such as semiconductors, it is likely that Beijing will propose a timetable for national reunification later in this period.Long term (2036 to 2049)- The timeline is likely to achieve national reunification before 2049 (the 100th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China). The mainland will use its strength to propose reunification, and if Taiwan does not accept the mainland's conditions, Beijing may take the initiative to take action, including military actions.
