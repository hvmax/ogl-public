### AN AUTOMAKER PROPS UP A CITY: BMW IN SHENYANG

19 April 2024|China, Economic Development, Trade
AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy and, in particular, life in China. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. We have sought to advance a conversation about the U.S.-China relationship, and a deep understanding of local economic development in China. We have written a series about the strategic strength oflocal economic development in China’s 2nd and 3rd tier citiesandentrepreneurship in China today. These case studies are part of a larger project in which we report on the strength of China’s economic development model (e.g.,hereandhere). Our focus in these posts is on the Chinese theory of economic development and on examples of local leaders operating in this practice of development. In many ways, these local leaders are the quiet heroes of China’s economic development prowess. This post adds to that conversation.
What China Has to Teach the World
In 1979, China was the world’s tenth largest economy, with a Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of about $260 billion, one-tenth the size of the world’s largest economy, the United States, which had a GDP of about $2.8 trillion. Today, China’s economy sits at $17.8 trillion, second only to the US’s economy of $27.8 trillion.
The last four decades, since China’s Economic Opening in 1979, have shown that China has constructed a market economy more powerful than any capitalist economy in the world today. Many observers remain skeptical about China’s development model. We disagree. Today, China’s market economy is the world’s most powerful manufacturing economy across a wide variety of economic sectors, from smartphone components to solar panels to electric automobiles. As China’s growth rates continue to outpace that of the US – and each of the world’s largest economies – it is our prediction that China will take its place as the worlds’ largest economy in about 2035.
How should we understand China’s rise from the destructive period of the previous three decades, which included the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution? In previous posts, we have spelled out our argument for what has made China’s economic development model so successful. As with previous posts, we once again unpack this dynamic interaction of national development goals and the pressures faced, and actions cities lower in China’s administrative hierarchy, cities like Changzhou of Jiangsu Province.
We build on China scholar Andrew Walder’s (1995) concept of “local governments as industrial firms” and Economic Sociologist Neil Fligstein’s political-cultural approach to market building. Bringing the work of these two eminent theorists together, we argue that China’s economic transformation has been so successful because the Chinese government has built a political-cultural approach to market building, where local officials have grown up in a culture of entrepreneurialism and innovation. Local governments are deeply involved in market construction in their local jurisdictions. They are loosely guided by the Central Government’s broad plans, but they are given the freedom and incentives to build their local markets as they see fit.
Thus, instead of the empty notion of free market governance put forward in Neoclassical Economic Theory, China’s economy thrives on the frenetic entrepreneurialism of its local governments. Through this architecture of markets, playing out at the local levels across the country, China will be the world’s dominant economy for decades to come. Quoting from an earlier post on Zhenjiang (see here):
“Economic development in China is fundamentally shaped by government guidance and centralized control. This has been true since the beginning of the economic reforms (and during the Communist Era as well). However, while we often think of the Chinese government as the authoritarian, protectionist, centralized party in Beijing, that is only one side of the government. In reality, local governments are the engines driving China’s growth. Indeed, the Chinese government is an extremely decentralized and entrepreneurial system of district and township governments. The mayors of China’s districts, townships, and villages behave like corporate CEOs, focusing on KPIs, pursuing foreign investment, and advancing their own careers through the financial and economic achievements in their districts and townships.
But they don’t do it alone – they do it through close coordination with China’s private sector and with foreign investors from abroad. Companies like Tencent, Alibaba, and Huawei, but also Apple, GM, Boeing, and Microsoft have worked closely with these local governments to drive a phenomenon of local state competition. What the Chinese have discovered is that private property is not the cornerstone of capitalism, as economists have long thought – local competition is. Thus, while rapid privatization programs were unleashed on the former Soviet Bloc, China carefully set in place a balance between state control and local state incentives. It then mixed this balance with enough autonomy for local governments to go out and recruit partners from the private sector and abroad. It has allowed China to build the most dynamic manufacturing supply chain in the world. And it has allowed China to quietly become one of the most innovative economies in the world. Through our analyses of cases that range from Tier 1 cities like Shanghai, Hangzhou, and Shenzhen to Tier 2, 3, and 4 cities like Changzhou, Zhenjiang, Nantong, Guiyang, and many others, we analyze how local governments are creating the framework for a new economic landscape in China.”
“Economic development in China is fundamentally shaped by government guidance and centralized control. There is a lot of strategic planning going on in five-year plans, 10-year plans, and 20-year plans. This has been true since the start of economic reforms and during the Mao Era as well. While we often think of the Chinese government as an authoritarian, protectionist, and centralized party in Beijing, that is only one side of the government. In practice, local governments are the true engines driving China’s growth. Indeed, the Chinese government is an extremely decentralized and entrepreneurial system of district and township governments. The mayors of China’s districts, townships, and villages behave like corporate CEOs, focusing on Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), pursuing foreign investment, and advancing their own careers through the financial and economic achievements in their districts and townships.”
“But local governments don’t do it alone. They do it through close coordination with China’s private sector and with foreign investors from abroad. Companies like Tencent, Alibaba, and Huawei are partners, of course, but also Apple, GM, Boeing, and Microsoft have worked closely with these local governments to drive local state competition. And they work to choose areas to build industrial clusters. What the Chinese have discovered is that private property is not the cornerstone of capitalism, as economists have long thought – local competition is. Thus, while rapid privatization programs were unleashed on the former Soviet Bloc, China carefully set in place a balance between state control and local incentives. It then mixes this balance with enough autonomy for local governments to go out and recruit partners from the private sector and abroad to build industrial clusters that build their local economies.”
This particular case is about the growth of the automobile industry in China. As with all of our research, rather than simplistically tracking macrolevel economic data, we focus on specific cases of the building of industrial clusters in specific locations. The case under exploration here is the powerful evolution of China’s automobile industry through an analysis of the case of BMW in China’s northeastern city of Shenyang. This is a nuanced case, as the result has been mixed – while BMW has met with great success in China, some critics view the city as too heavily dependent on its BMW venture, leading to a lack of growth in other areas.
The Case of BMW in Shenyang
No one would have imagined that BMW/MINI would ignite a public fury during the 2023 Shanghai Auto Show, just because of the stingy way it gave out ice cream to visitors. MINI China ended up releasing two apologies for the incident, but still failed to calm down the rage on social media (1). But it was not only BMW that was nervous; so was the northeastern city of Shenyang, which had just applauded the landing of the “5 millionth” BMW vehicle produced in China.
Founded in May 2003, BMW Brilliance Automotive Ltd. (BBA) is a joint venture between the BMW Group and Brilliance Auto Group. Located in Shenyang with about 26,000 employees, BBA is the largest producer of premium cars in China and its plants in Shenyang have developed into BMW’s largest production location worldwide. Since 2006, BBA has been the largest taxpayer of Shenyang. It contributed ￥48.5 billion (US$7.21 billion) in tax revenue in 2022, accounting for 91.6% of Shenyang’s tax revenue that year.
China has been BMW’s largest sales market since after overtaking US in 2013. Chinese customers bought some 826,300 vehicles under the BMW umbrella in the 2023 fiscal year, and accounted for around 32.3% of Rolls-Royce, BMW, and MINI sales combined. The country is also the home to the Group’s most extensive R&D and production operations outside Germany.
The BMW Variations
There is no doubt that as a latecomer to China, BMW has achieved tremendous success in the Chinese market. In its 30+ years venture, BMW has played a “variation” to approach the market, from wait-and-see, to testing the water, and finally doubling down on China. During the wait-and-see period (1994-2002), BMW opened a representative office in Beijing in 1994. By the time BMW had its first assembly line in Shenyang, its German competitor Volkswagen already had two joint ventures (founded in 1985 and 1991) to manufacture VW and Audi vehicles in China. Considering the huge gap between its high-end cars and the income level of the Chinese people at that time, BMW’s careful approach was understandable. The downside was that when Munich finally made up its mind to open a factory in China, there were only a few potential Chinese JV partners left from which to choose (2). BMW finally agreed to a deal with Brilliance Auto, then China’s largest van maker, to set up a 50-50 joint venture (JV). Gunther Seemann, then President of BMW Greater China, contributed to the cooperation, the similar mindset and management system, and especially the personal charm of Yang Rong (3), then the chairman of Brilliance. Figure 2 lays out the timeline of BMW’s milestones in China.
Testing the Water Period (2003-2009): Yang Rong’s controversial departure in 2002 did not change BMW’s decision, and the BBA contract was signed in March 2003. BBA had registered capital of €150 million, and investment for the phase one was €450 million. The plan was to produce about 30,000 BMW’s Series 3 and Series 5 a year. One important consideration for BMW was that Brilliance Auto would rent its production line to BBA for CKD (Completely Knocked Down) production. Investing in China’s auto industry was not a surefire deal. Among the first three auto JVs in China, i.e. Beijing Jeep, Shanghai Volkswagen, and Guangzhou Peugeot, only Shanghai Volkswagen is in regular operation. From 2003 to 2008, BMW’s sales in China soared from 18,000 to 66,000 units. Because the asset-light model was no longer suitable for the rapid-growing demand, BMW’s Munich headquarters finally made up its mind for an aggressive expansion.
Doubling Down on China Period (after 2010): Since 2010, BBA has been scaling up its production capacity and capability through massive investments. In 2018, the JV was extended for another 22 years. In 2022, BMW increased its stake in BBA from 50% to 75%, following Beijing’s relaxation of the decades-old investment restrictions in the automotive sector. In 2023, BBA celebrated the rolling out of its 5 millionth car and the JV’s 20th anniversary. Since 2010, the total investment of BBA has exceeded ￥100 billion. With three vehicle plants, an R&D Center, and a powertrain plant,  BBA ‘s production base in Shenyang is now the largest within the BMW Group.
In return, China has grown into the biggest market for BMW, bigger than the USA and Germany combined. Although there has been unfavorable news such as product quality issues every now and then, BMW maintains a strong and recognizable premium brand image and positioning.
Don’t Invest in Northeast China?
On August 3, 2003, five months after BBA was set up, Wen Jiabao, then Premier of the State Council of China, proposed to revitalize the old industrial areas in Northeast China. Since then, “the Revitalization of the Northeast” (东北振兴) has officially become a national development strategy. However, compared with “the Western Development” (西部大开发) proposed in the late 1990s, the result of the revitalization of the Northeast is far less than expected, a phenomenon touted as “reviving but not prosperous” (振而不兴). Including Liaoning Province and Shenyang City, business environment in Northeast China has been criticized a lot, so much so that the iconic slang “Investment should not go beyond Shanhaiguan” (4) is often believed in social media.
Such a curse does not apply to BBA, a top priority project of the local government at all levels and has received super-national treatment, a few examples here:
The local governments and BBA have built a special task force and an effective communication mechanism;Government approval processes involving planning, land and construction formalities have been handled without any delay;An expressway is built to connect two BBA plant sites that are 50 km apart. Metro Line 3 (under construction) has set up three stations next to BBA plants;A number of large residential complexes, talent apartments and recreational parks have been built around the BBA sites;To improve medical service, Shenyang brought in a top Beijing hospital to set up a branch near the BBA and has established direct channels of medical-expense settlements for foreigners with more than 50 overseas insurance institutions;German international communities, China-Germany parks and a 12-year German international school have also been built to accommodate the expatriate life.

While the BMW Group is making a fortune in the Chinese market, it has also brought great benefits to Liaoning province and especially Shenyang city:
BBA is the largest taxpayer in Shenyang, providing a stable and lucrative income for the city’s finances.By implementing its “local for local” approach, BBA has driven the development of the local supply chain. In 2022, BBA’s parts procurement across the country exceeded ￥73 billion, of which 60% came from Liaoning Province. Among its 430 plus suppliers in the country, more than a quarter of these are in Liaoning Province and nearly 100 in Shenyang City.BBA has raised Shenyang’s visibility at home and abroad, which helps the city to attract more investments and talent.

Observations and Takeaways
Through its JV, BMW has achieved results in China that are the envy of its peers. There are unique reasons for its success:
1.  A Development Strategy that is prudent but also committed – a representative office, the asset-light strategy at BBA’s early stage and accelerated expansion. BMW has pursued a long-term approach and makes real-time decisions based on the market situation and the performance of its JV.
2.  A Quiet JV Partner – BMW saw the big picture in selecting JV partners and carefully handling those relationships：
a)  Selecting one JV partner who could greatly reduce the workload and time spent by the China executive team in managing the relationship and allocating resources.
b)  China Brilliant is an ideal JV partner – It brings in the relationship with the local governments, and cares about dividends rather than the JV’s daily operations. In 2018, when Beijing relaxed its market access policy for foreign automakers, BMW became the first foreign automaker to increase its JV share.
c)  BMW understood clearly that the brand’s position and weight is determined by its JV’s performance in this market.
3.  An Excellent Product – While reducing costs, the localized production does not lower requirements. In China, quality of BBA’s vehicles is even better than that of imported ones. After raising its share in BBA in 2022, BMW’s first big move is to launch the domestically produced X5, a version with long wheelbase for the Chinese market, breaking the tradition that the flagship models of German luxury car brands are always imported. In 2023, 93,857 units of X5 were delivered in China and ranks first with a market share of 15.68% for models with transaction price above ￥500,000 yuan, Mercedes-Benz GLE ranks the second place with a market share of 6.65%.
Among the many foreign automakers, BBA excels because it maintains its sobriety towards the market and keeps its own rhythm of operation.
Twenty years after BBA was founded, China’s auto market has changed dramatically, from a seller’s market to a buyer’s market. Product quality is more defined by consumers and determined by customer satisfaction. Local auto brands, especially new energy vehicle brands from private companies, are rising strongly and have an edge over JVs. Local brands also have high-end products that are targeting the market of traditional foreign premium brands such as BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Audi. What works for China will eventually work around the world. For BMW, the next two to three years in China will be critical.
Shenyang as a city is a mixed situation. The success of the BBA has not stopped the sliding in the city’s economic rankings, and people seem to have a new concern. Is Shenyang too dependent on BMW? Indeed, Northeastern cities need more variety in their business ecosystems to move beyond  dependence on heavy manufacturing. In order to truly stimulate the vitality of this important northern city, it is necessary for Shenyang to seize the changes brought in by BBA, break the local people’s conservative mindset, which is still deep rooted in its heyday of the planned economy period, and create a business environment that allows enterprises to reach for and accomplish higher economic goals, regardless of size and ownership, and without special attention from the government.
1.  A video went viral that showed staff at MINI booth refused to give free ice cream to a Chinese female visitor by saying that the promotional gift had run out, but a foreigner was offered one a few moments later.
2.  According to industry policy published in 1994, foreign automakers had to set up joint venture with a local auto company if they want to produce in China and their share in JV is limited to 50 percent. An automaker (regardless Chinese or foreign) can establish maximum two joint ventures. In 2003, China’s three largest car companies, FAW, Dongfeng Motor and SAIC, each had set up two JVs. In 2018, Beijing announced further reform within the auto industry that would completely terminate such policy starting January 1, 2022.
3.  Yang Rong(仰融) was the automotive tycoon who went on a self-imposed exile in the United States, following a dispute with the Liaoning government in 2002 when Bo Xilai was the governor.
4.  “Investment should not go beyond Shanhaiguan” is the translation of “投资不出山海关.” Shanhaiguan (“The Path between Mountains and Seas”) is the eastern end of the Great Wall. The region outside Shanhaiguan is generally classified as the Northeast China.
5.  In 1997, the French side transferred their assets and debts of Guangzhou Peugeot to Honda for a symbolic sum of 1 franc. In 2006, Beijing Jeep was merged into BAIC Benz.
