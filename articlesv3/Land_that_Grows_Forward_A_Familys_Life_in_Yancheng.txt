### Land that Grows Forward: A Family’s Life in Yancheng

26 July 2024|China, China history, Chinese Culture
AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy and, in particular, life in China. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. We have sought to advance a conversation about the U.S.-China relationship, and a deep understanding of local economic development in China. We have written a series about the strategic strength oflocal economic development in China’s 2nd and 3rd tier citiesandentrepreneurship in China today. These case studies are part of a larger project in which we report on the strength of China’s economic development model (e.g.,hereandhere). Our focus in these posts is on the Chinese theory of economic development – what Andrew Walder has called “local governments as industrial firms” – and on examples of local leaders operating in this practice of development. In many ways, these local leaders are the heroes of China’s economic development prowess. The people living in these dynamic fast-growing cities are also the voices who can help us better understand China’s reform process. This post adds to that conversation, with an interview withVivian Shen of the city of Yancheng.
As part of OGL’s commitment to deep research and analysis, we strive to systematically gather statistical data that allows for econometric analyses, as well as seeking out intelligence based on an in-depth, ethnographic approach to learning what is happening in an economy. We believe in listening to the voices of the actors in the economy, hearing what they have to say and learning from how they frame the decisions they make.
With this post, OGL is launching an “ethnographic listening series,” where we interview and ask individuals in the regions we are studying to tell us what they are seeing there and how that might contribute to our insights. This post looks at what life is like in the city of Yancheng in Jiangsu Province.(Interview questions are followed by direct quotes. The answers were given in Chinese. We have translated those answers for our readers.)
Tell us a little about Yancheng from your point of view, both its character and its economy.
Yancheng is in Jiangsu Province and sits about 300 kilometers west of Shanghai. The curious thing about the city is that not only is it the only city in China without a single mountain, but it is also a city with a growing land mass. The coastal area of Yancheng extends to the sea at the speed of more than 10 square kilometers every year, and it sits on the longest coastline, the largest coastal mudflat, and the largest sea area in Jiangsu Province. At the same time, it is the only ecological city in China and recognized internationally as a World Natural Heritage site and an International Wetland City. Walking on the mudflat of the Yellow Sea wetland in Yancheng, you can see the gold flowing in midsummer, the sea and sky intertwined, the green surging, cranes dancing and deer singing. The white windmill spins gently, the melodious whistle drags in the summer afterglow, everywhere is scenery. In this bucolic landscape, which I now call home, people linger and forget to leave.
In terms of the economy, Jiangsu Province ranks second in GDP among all provinces in China in 2023, while Yancheng City belongs to the middle level of the 13 municipalities directly under the government under Jiangsu Province. Although its ranking is not high in Jiangsu, Yancheng has the largest production base of crystalline silicon photovoltaic industry cluster base in China, and it has the first 10 million kilowatt new energy power generation city in the Yangtze River Delta region. As such, our little city supports pillar industries such as electric automobiles and new energy in China. The Yancheng Municipal Government will also focus on the development of the marine economy after 2024, while also focusing on the existing economic development. According to the ‘Three Year Action Plan for High Quality Development of Marine Economy (2024-2026)’ issued by the Yancheng Municipal Government, Yancheng will further deepen the construction of the demonstration zone for marine economic development, cultivate and strengthen the marine industry, and expand marine openness and cooperation. As a city on the edge of the ocean with unique “growing” land, we have high expectations for this movement.
Tell us a little bit more about your life in Yancheng.
I like to think of my life in Yancheng now as returning to my origin. I am a native of Yancheng and have spent almost my entire career in Yancheng. A few years ago, due to personal reasons and after I had worked at my original place of employment for some 30 years, I prepared for early retirement. However, ‘poetry and distant places’ are sometimes not far away, sometimes they are right at home where you live. After traveling for some time, I decided to resume my working career outside of the government, taking a position as the Financial Director for a local technology company. I am back doing almost exactly what I was doing before I retired. Of course, as a retired government official in the national civil service series, I am not allowed to engage in profit-making activities directly related to my original job for a certain period of time after retirement, so I have to guard against this. But my work today is very similar to what I used to do, sothe role transition has not been difficult for me. As I had been working in finance and taxation for many years, most of my time was focused on professional tax inspections. So, for my transition, I made myself ready to become a Financial Director of a company.
Still, I do feel a sense of urgency sometimes. Recently, my focus has been on leading and managing three tasks for the company. One of the tasks: preparing to apply for the national high-tech enterprise. The biggest problem at present is that we still need one patent or five software copyrights, and I need to urge the relevant R&D personnel to speed up the pace. The second task is to apply for the Jiangsu Province Entrepreneurship Talent Project. The third task is to participate in the Yancheng Innovation Competition.
These three projects are initiated and promoted by three levels of government, aiming to encourage enterprises to engage in technological innovation and industrial upgrading. These jobs are undoubtedly a stimulation and display of soft power for enterprises. Once the application is successful or the ranking is obtained, not only will the government provide certain incentives, but it is also of great significance to enhance the competitiveness of the enterprise and establish the company's image. My demand for the team is ‘give it all and be determined to win!’
Can you reflect a little bit on the way we at On Global Leadership see China’s local governments as industrial firms for growth? Are we right or do you see it differently?
Within the framework of a unified national strategy, local governments in China have played a crucial role in promoting the implementation of various economic goals. According to Professor Guthrie, local governments are the true engines driving China's economic growth, and the description is very vivid and appropriate.
Over the years, in my interactions with the government in multiple capacities, I have deeply felt the resilience and efforts demonstrated by local governments for the development of the local economy. They not only play the role of economic managers and supervisors, but as their interdependence with enterprises becomes increasingly close, local governments are more likely to act as drivers and service providers of economic development. As the saying goes, “There are a thousand threads above, but a needle below”, which often reflects the complexity and responsibility of grassroots government work in China. All the work of grassroots governments is still progressing and unfolding in an orderly manner.
In China, in order to improve work efficiency, facilitate government enterprise interaction, and promote work implementation, the government usually forms enterprise groups through WeChat apps to issue notices and supervise work. I have participated in several government-led enterprise groups. Below I’ve included the notices issued by the government of a certain industrial park in the last 4 days (July 8-11, 2024) among the 488 member enterprise group.
The following are the titles of notifications published in chronological order:
Notice from the General Office of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology on Conducting the Evaluation of Science and Technology based Small and Medium sized Enterprises in 2024.Notice on Launching the Collection of First Edition Software Products in Key Areas of Jiangsu Province in 2024.Notice on Carrying out the Application Work for Provincial Enterprise Technology Centers in 2024.Notice on Holding the 5th China Yancheng Innovation and Entrepreneurship Competition.Notice of Registration for the July 2024 Kecheng Street Network and Offline Job Fair Activities.Notice on the Recommendation of the Entry of the 2024 Municipal High tech Enterprise Cultivation Database.Reminder on Carrying out the Application for National Foreign Expert Projects in 2024.Notice on Launching Pilot Work for the Construction of Characteristic Application Scenarios of “Data Element X.”
1. Notice from the General Office of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology on Conducting the Evaluation of Science and Technology based Small and Medium sized Enterprises in 2024.
2. Notice on Launching the Collection of First Edition Software Products in Key Areas of Jiangsu Province in 2024.
3. Notice on Carrying out the Application Work for Provincial Enterprise Technology Centers in 2024.
4. Notice on Holding the 5th China Yancheng Innovation and Entrepreneurship Competition.
5. Notice of Registration for the July 2024 Kecheng Street Network and Offline Job Fair Activities.
6. Notice on the Recommendation of the Entry of the 2024 Municipal High tech Enterprise Cultivation Database.
7. Reminder on Carrying out the Application for National Foreign Expert Projects in 2024.
8. Notice on Launching Pilot Work for the Construction of Characteristic Application Scenarios of “Data Element X.”
I believe these notices reflect the following characteristics”:
“First is to notify at three levels, central, provincial, and Yancheng city, reflects the comprehensive linkage and implementation of programs at various levels of government.
Second, the content focuses on promoting and facilitating technological innovation and industrial upgrading in enterprises, and is accompanied by corresponding reward and punishment measures, reflecting the current industrial policy orientation and work intensity of the Chinese government.”
Third, there are two notices that serve enterprises. For example, Article 5 is a notice that the government organizes recruitment fairs online and offline to help enterprises solve the problem of recruitment difficulties. Here, the role of local governments as engines is fully demonstrated. Indeed, after years of effort, Chinese governments at all levels have developed very mature and systematic practices in supporting the survival and development of enterprises and creating a high-quality business environment and have been optimizing and adjusting them in a timely manner.
However, there have also been many criticisms. It is an undeniable fact that the local finances of the government are generally tight, and the reasons are multifaceted, which will not be elaborated here. This situation has led to a decline in the level of some public services, insufficient investment in infrastructure construction, or serious arrears in project payments, and delayed implementation of some government promised preferential policies. To be honest, the overall work of local governments can be described in this adage: “the defects cannot observe the viruses.” （瑕不掩瑜）
Can you give us a little more personal details, perhaps a story about your son?
Night markets are a favorite place for people from Yancheng in the summer. Yancheng has five major night markets, all of which are very popular. Next Monday evening, my son invited my mother and me to go for a stroll at the Dayang Bay Night Market, and also to have some local snacks and chat at a nearby restaurant. Grandma really likes her precious grandson, and she also loves to go to night markets, so we are all looking forward to it.
I particularly like to describe the everyday life in Yancheng as the ‘subtle aroma of everyday life rising up’ (袅袅人间烟火气). In the morning, the exercise army can be found in various parks, the bustling food market awakens with street snacks emitting the scents of sesame seed cake, deep-fried dough sticks, and soybean milk. In the afternoon, the middle-aged and elderly dance teams and women's cheongsam show perform against the backdrop of Yanchang’s afternoon sun. And in the early evening, there is no place more bustling with people, smoke, and food cooking, than Yancheng’s bustling night market. A late night snack, a night tour, a night talk in small groups, eating delicious food, drinking and chatting happily. The vibrant atmosphere colors the lives of Yancheng’s people in this little city we call home.
Going to the night market for relaxation and entertainment this time is one aspect, but what I am most looking forward to is having a heart-to-heart talk with my son. My son received his undergraduate degree at the University of California, Irvine, in the United States. My initial idea was for him to continue pursuing a master's or even doctoral degree in the United States after graduating from his undergraduate studies. Unexpectedly, after graduating from university, he returned to China with a few classmates to start a business. That was in 2019, and the location was in Shanghai. Everyone knows what has happened to China and to the world after that.
After experiencing his first setback in life, with my persistence, he became a practitioner in the securities industry in early 2021. In our previous impression, securities companies were units with high salaries and low pressure. With the ‘country’ prefix, work would be even easier. However, it was only after entering the securities industry that my son realized how unfriendly this industry is to its new employees.
There are several reasons for this. First, the workload is heavy, scope of responsibilities large. From adding new assets to effective accounts, from stocks to funds, various forms of tasks are astonishing, making it really difficult for new employees to carry out their work. Second, market competition is fierce in this industry. Whether it is brokerage, investment banking, or asset management in the business, customer stickiness is low, and the differentiation of services among peers is not significant enough, making it difficult to retain customers. It is still difficult for old employees to maintain customers, let alone new employees to expand their customer base. Third, the stock market situation has intensified the difficulty of generating revenue in this sector. The long-term downturn and recent continuous decline of the Chinese stock market have led to a decline in the overall efficiency of the securities industry, with industry personnel turnover and salary cuts coexisting.
Faced with this work situation, giving up is not a solution; only facing the problem directly can solve it. This process also reflects his consistent restlessness. My son decided to focus on four measures”:
●  First, he must quickly learn about the securities business; he must obtain the securities industry qualification certificate and securities investment advisory qualification in the shortest possible time, laying the foundation for engaging in new business.
●  Second he is resolving to carry out innovative work. For new employees, there is no room for basic business development, and the only way to achieve the goal is to open up new product channels. To be honest, the securities company he works for has a problem of overall aging of personnel, low level of knowledge, and weak enterprising spirit. This is both a challenge and an opportunity. My son has taken a different approach and opened up various income generating varieties. It is said that two provinces are using them for the first time.
●  Third, he must be open to new networking resources. China is a society that values human relationships, and family and friends have provided support for this.
●  Fourth, he knows he must increase his knowledge reserves, preparing to continue studying and pursuing further education. He has now resolved to prepare for the postgraduate entrance examination and preparing for job changes.
My son is quite capable. In 2022, my son applied to take the MBA graduate exam at Fudan University and achieved top scores in three rounds of interviews and one written test. The worthiest of praise is the postgraduate entrance examination written test at the end of 2022. I remember that that period was the most serious period of the COVID-19, and almost all the people around were infected. My son had been well protected before. Who knew that he had a high fever on the morning of his first exam. I remember when I drove her into the exam room, her body temperature was as high as 39.8 ℃. Later, I heard him say that his mind was almost blank for the first half hour after entering the exam room, and he only started answering questions half an hour later. The two subsequent exams were also similar. Achieving excellent results is not easy!
The days of part-time work and part-time study are not easy. Now he works at securities company on weekdays, dedicating himself to researching professional knowledge, conducting research and visits to new and old clients, and carrying out his work more smoothly; Every weekend, I take the high-speed train to Shanghai to attend classes at Fudan University and actively prepare for my graduation thesis. Despite the high work pressure and heavy learning tasks, he always manages to immerse himself in learning and work with a positive attitude and full enthusiasm, giving his all according to the established goals.
I think when we go to the night market next Monday, we should try to avoid talking about his work and studies as much as possible. He is already under a lot of pressure, and he is a mature, idealistic, and determined person. Let’s talk about some relaxed and happy topics.
This time, I won’t interfere too much with his next career plan. I know there is a light in his heart that will be enough to illuminate his direction of progress.
This is wonderful. All so interesting. Any final words before I let you go?
Time flies like a shuttle. But the sun will still rise tomorrow. At various stages of life, facing the joys and sorrows of life, the success or failure of a career, as long as the heart has direction and puts in all its efforts, one can feel at ease.。The ancient Chinese poet,Bai Juyi,said in his poemwrote, ‘Peace of mind means returning to one’s hometown’ (心安是所归). Referring to my hometown, I have a firm goal in my heart will surely succeed!” (心之所向, 行将必至)
