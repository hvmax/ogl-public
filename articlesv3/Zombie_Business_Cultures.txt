Zombies represent a defining monstrousness of our time. Questions of how and why the undead have resonated so deeply in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries have tended to preoccupy cultural interpreters of television, film, and popular fiction more than business and market analysts. Sarah Juliet Lauro’sZombie Theory: A Readeris an illustrative collection of articles that explore many of the cultural anxieties that popular cultural representations of zombies convey. These include the depredations of late Capitalism, the dehumanization of ever-increasing consumerism, the social toll of ecological disasters, and the othering of and violence against bodies that accompany political extremism. Yet economists have also appropriated the term to refer specifically to “zombie firms” – that is, weak old firms that, in particular lending conditions, stagnate financially and slow the growth of given markets. What remains unexamined, and the focus of discussion here, are the “zombie cultures” that may exist within some of these firms and others.
Several recent pieces pick up the conventional economic usage of zombies. In the FT, columnist Robert Armstrong wrote about “how to avoid a corporate zombie apocalypse.” With interest rates low, investors continue to inject liquidity into legacy companies. Using retailer JC Penney as a lead example, he argues that zombie firms should be resting in their graves but “instead they walk abroad, reanimated by cheap money.” As a result, they depress prices and lessen room in the market for new retailers or for Amazon to sell for even less. Zombies are the “dark flipside” of asset bubbles, the piece goes, with “ample liquidity allow[ing] weak companies to push hard choices into the hazy future.”
Armstrong cites anLSE blog postabout how zombie firms in the OECD “are kept alive at the expense of investment, employment and productivity.” That post is drawn, in turn, from aresearch articleby the same OECD economists that appeared in a 2018 issue of theEconomic Policy. Their conclusions emphasize the far-reaching negative impact on their industries: by absorbing investment and employment resources, zombie firms limit the productivity and growth possibilities of non-zombie incumbents and raise barriers to entry and to early-stage growth of young firms. As well, the OECD authors link a rise in zombie firms to a decline in the growth or business investment and of “multi-factor” productivity growth in the wider market.
Paul Krugman’sArguing With Zombiesis the Nobel Laureate’s latest book. While the book’s discussion of issues from social security to healthcare to tax cuts is expectedly economic, the broader argument addresses the travails of policy making in the current post-evidence, post-truth environment. “Zombie ideas” are based on outdated concepts or outright misinformation, which, for Krugman, continue to be promoted by Republican representatives in the U.S. These are the titular zombies with whom he is arguing – those who are unwilling to acknowledge the “ideas that should have been killed by contrary evidence, but instead keep shambling along, eating people’s brains.” It’s a damning critique that nevertheless too easily casts all those who adopt or defend different economic models as unthinking adversaries. At leastone reviewthus claims that the book’s argument is “founded on radical simplification” of opposing viewpoints and theories that contributes to the very Manichaean divide Krugman assails.
While we should be cautious about any such overly strict categorizing of people and their economic or political views, the nature of zombies typically relies on their fundamental differences from human beings.Philosophers, for example, have long used zombies to explore questions of consciousness and its relation to the physical body and world. These hypothetical beings are unlike those more familiar to us from film or witchcraft. Yet they foreground the challenge of defining zombies in specific contexts. In business, as we’ve seen, the standard definition is when an old firm persistently has problems covering the interest payments on their debt. Since these firms would otherwise exit a competitive market, allowing for the expansion of healthy firms and productivity growth in the market, they become the “walking dead” — kept alive by easy credit and weak regulation but without meaningful prospects for growth.
While “zombie firms” are identifiable in economics research and discussions of firms’ financial and performance stagnation, “zombie cultures” in firms and other organizations have been less clearly defined. “Culture” itself, of course, is notoriously difficult to characterize. “The way we do things around here,” an old saw from McKinsey, helps to emphasize culture as behavioral rather than only the stuff of espoused values or mission statements. More recently, inWhat You Do Is Who You Are, Andreesen Horowitz co-founder Ben Horowitz writes: “Culture isn’t a magical set of rules that makes everyone behave the way you’d like. It’s a system of behaviors that you hope most people will follow, most of the time.” That everyday emphasis on systems or patterns of behavior is crucial, though it still mostly highlights culture as desirable and positive behaviors to pursue. If “culture is a set of living relationships,” as Daniel Coyle observed inThe Culture Code, those relationships can be constructive, destructive, or indifferent. In other words, culture as an evolving system of mindsets and microbehaviors exists regardless of our hopes or efforts and, as such, can also represent what leaders want to change or rid organizations of.
Considering what constitutes “zombie cultures” can potentially help leaders to understand and address a specific subset of blindspots, dysfunctions, and inabilities to think deliberately about behavioral change in specific organizations. When turning to the matter of definition, an initial realization should be that there is not a single zombie culture but several. Another is that while zombie firms are a useful starting point, we should remain open to the possibility that other firms without the problem of making interest payments may still have zombie cultures. So what are the key characteristics? Staying true to the defining attribute of conscious agency of zombies across popular culture, witchcraft, and academic disciplines alike, at the heart of zombie culture is a lack of deliberate, thoughtful, and open-minded actions appropriate to specific organizations and situations. This lack can occur in any organization, small or large, new or old, and it can be intentional or unintentional.
To expand on this initial observation, we might begin to sketch out four types of “zombie cultures”:
1.Zombie Firm Culture. Old and weak businesses in which behaviors and relationships have the consistent problem of delivering levels of productivity, performance or employee experience that maintain their place and competitiveness in the financial and talent markets. This is the cultural flipside of financially stagnant and over-leveraged zombie firms, with leaders unable to deliver on the fulfilling and mutually rewarding psychological contracts they forge with employees.
2.Legacy Firm Culture. Old but stronger businesses in which behaviors and relationships may be strong and cohesive but built for the past. Leaders here are often deliberate in their culture-building efforts, doubling-down on what has worked in the past, but misaligning their people with current and future needs and priorities in the organization and relevant marketplaces of products and talent.
3.Transplant Culture. Old businesses that adopt superficial elements of what they see – particularly in the popular management press about start-ups and other newer businesses – as the ingredients of successful cultures elsewhere. Foosball tables, free drinks or food, learning and development opportunities, flexible work schedules. Often with good intentions and deliberate efforts, leaders commit to transplanting artifacts of successful cultures they are familiar with, regardless of the appropriateness to their own organizations and markets.
4.Copycat Culture. Like Transplant Culture but for start-up and newer businesses. Leaders copy aspects of cultures that have been successful elsewhere in hopes they will help the new firms to scale. Since a majority of successful cultural features celebrated in the popular management press are arguably practiced by start-ups or recently founded firms, especially in tech, the copying presumes similarities in a wide array of other variables (markets, resources, strategies) that are, in fact, often quite different.
Again, the central “zombie” quality threading through these four cultures is the absence or major lack of open-minded thinking and thoughtful decision-making and deliberate action. An extreme end of that thread reaches, even without the political associations claimed by Krugman, toward propagating incomplete or outdated information. In the business world, the circumscribed knowledge of leaders often leaves them committed to culture change but lacking the information needed to pursue it in their specific situations. Likewise, consultants bring their own knowledge and preferred approaches to culture change – sometimes superficial, sometimes robust – but grounded in their own experience. To overcome the blindered thinking and incomplete information that produce and sustain zombie cultures, leaders can follow several courses of action:
·Invest in Anti-(Cognitive) Bias Training.Cognitive biases and heuristicslimit and shape our apprehension and processing of data and information and, ultimately, our decision-making. Leaders of legacy firms may succumb to a continuation of plan bias or familiarity heuristic, for example, when facing multiple potential change scenarios. As leaders and as people, we often don’t know what we don’t know, and learning more about how we think can improve our thinking and decision-making.
·Looking Beyond Superficiality and Hype. Leaders committed to better their cultures have greater and greater access to a surplus of popular resources (magazines, blogposts, videos) about business management and, specifically, organizational change and transformation. Yet beyond its greatly uneven quality, much of this content recycles simplistic and superficial approaches to cultural change that leaders need to avoid. Years ago, innovation guru Bill O’Connor referred to this appealing material as“creative voyeurism” and “innovation porn,”and I more recently called it the literature of“Pop Creative Leadership.”
·“Take a wrecking ball to your company’s iconic practices.”The title of a recent article by London Business School professor Herminia Ibarra summarizes her challenge to leaders to drive change where it is most meaningful. She concludes: “Their organizations must unlearn the lessons of years of experience and understand that the very cultural values that made them successful in the past may have hardened into iconic practices that are now holding them back.”
·Embrace Conflicts. A proven shift in leadership perspective is from cultures marked by a single predominant value or behavior to cultures understood and managed for their major defining conflicts, say between two different values or behaviors. Two decades ago,Kim Cameron and Robert Quinnof the University of Michigan developed a framework that approaches cultures in terms of “competing values.” More recently, Harvard’sBoris Groysbergled a team that produced a leader’s guide to integrating distinct culture styles (rather than choosing and nurturing one).
·Engage the Culture Outside Your Firm. Just as OECD research underscores the relationships of zombie firms with local financial and talent markets, leaders need to address the immediate cultural settings in which their zombie cultures exist. Local, regional, and national cultures, as well as professional and industry cultures can shape and limit the mindsets, values and behaviors inside firms. An excellent starting place for leaders wanting to navigate multiple dimensions of cultural complexity is the work of INSEAD’sErin Meyer.
