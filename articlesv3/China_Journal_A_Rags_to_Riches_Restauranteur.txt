### China Journal: A Rags-to-Riches Restauranteur

AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide analyses about leadership in the global economy. In this post, Dr. Doug Guthrie, who is a co-founder of OGL, continues to curate a special series of China Journal entries over the next two weeks as he returns to China for the first time in four years. In this post, Dr. Guthrie discusses the local interest in an American view of the Chinese economy and meeting another talented Shanghai entrepreneur.
In all our interviews and casual conversations, Chinese people wanted to hear my views on the Chinese economy and on U.S.-China relations. Both issues are go-to topics in every conversation I'm having here, but more than anything, people want to hear my views on the Chinese economy.
This is partly, I think, because, as a business school professor who studies China’s economic development, I must have some level of expertise on the topic. The Chinese economy definitely suffered a slowdown in the wake of COVID, as did the U.S. economy, but the feeling is different here. In the United States, the constant refrain is inflation is up, Americans are hurting, and the economy is in free-fall. Supporters of the current administration shout back: inflation is down, unemployment is down, and everything is great!
Our own view at OGL is that, strangely enough, both sides are right, and both are wrong. The numbers do support the pro-Biden camp. Macroeconomic numbers that typically measure economies – inflation, GDP, unemployment – look pretty strong in the COVID recovery era. But we are also 40 years into the Milton Friedman revolution, which saw the transfer of 40% of America’s wealth from the working and middle class to the country’s economic elites. Yes, unemployment is low, but there are many more families living on minimum wage jobs today than four decades ago, when America’s manufacturing sector was still relatively strong.
In China, there are serious concerns about the economy, but they also seem cautiously optimistic. Interviews with local businesspeople inevitably come around to questions about the economy: what do you think of China’s economic prospects? Are you worried? Should we be worried? The stock market and foreign investment are down, and what can we do to recover? Do you think that U.S.-China relations are going to get better after the presidential meeting at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Summit?
The questions always come across in a tone that is respectful but concerned, imploring: please give us some answers, and help us see what we can do to continue to grow our economy and economic prospects. It’s just interesting to be conducting research, doing interviews with business people who operate as U.S. partners in production, but they also are key rivals, and these earnest questions keep coming.
The previous day was built around the meeting and discussions surrounding McDonald’s in China. Today, by design, was set up to be a powerful contrast – the other end of the economic spectrum if you will. If McDonald’s represents the iconographic image of American consumer culture – those yellow arches, which  represent the power of capitalism and a sign of how the brand is spreading throughout China – what would the opposite story be?
The opposite version of McDonald's powerhouse brand wasn’t fancy. It was Laoxhengxing. It could be described as a Chinese version of McDonald’s – bustling, fast-food service (no wait staff), all Chinese cuisine. A young energetic man came up and shook our hands, and my colleague Chris Gao introduced to the restaurant's owner, Ji Qiha [季其海]. He owns more than 70 fast-food shops in Shanghai and one in Beijing. Inspired by the McDonald’s business model, he thought, why don’t we have chains of Chinese fast-food restaurants like this? And he built one.
Ji’s life story is actually quite a compelling rags-to-riches tale, one that illustrates the transformative power of hard work. Born in China’s Anhui Province, in 1980, Ji was deeply moved by the movies and dramas he saw that depicted Shanghai as a city of opportunity and dreams. After graduating from high school in 1998, Ji left for Shanghai to find a job. Finding work in a restaurant, he enrolled in cooking school, and eventually he rose through the ranks from cleaner to sous chef to head chef.
He then struck out on his own to start a restaurant, failed twice, and on the third entrepreneurial leap hit the jackpot with his current brand, Laoshengxing. The restaurants are famous for Shanghainese and Suzhou-style soup xiaolongbao, coming in common pork filling or with pork and crab meat. The store is popular among the locals and people working nearby, and everyone points to it where you'll come away with a full stomach at a pretty reasonable price, 20 rmb or less than $3.
Ji now has about 100 stores in Shanghai and has just opened his first store in Beijing. We don’t know his finances, but he is surely quite well off with 100 restaurants under his umbrella. Such a gripping story to listen to – truly an inspiring story of success in China’s capitalist system.
Doug Guthrie has been a China scholar since the late 1980s, when he began studying Chinese language, literature and history at the University of Chicago. After graduate work at the University of California, Berkeley, he was a Professor of Management and Sociology at New York University for several years (1997-2010) and served as Dean of the School of Business and Vice President for University China Operations at the George Washington University (2010-14).
