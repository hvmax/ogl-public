### CHINA CONSUMPTION SERIES 5: SHIFT FROM INVESTMENT TO CONSUMPTION

23 September 2025|China's Transforming Economy
AtOn Global Leadership, we have developed a deep analysis of the Chinese economy and the Chinese economic transformation over the last 45 years. We have written about China’s innovative approach to building the most dynamic manufacturing supply chain in the world and China’s approach to building the world’s most dynamic capitalist economy. We have advanced this analysis through our work on China’ssecond- andthird-tier city development of innovative,entrepreneurial citiesandlocal industrial clusters. We have also used the field of NewEconomy Sociology(with leaders likeNeil Fligstein,Walter Powell, andHarrison White) and theNew Structural Economics(Justin Lin,林毅夫) and the field of Sociology (with scholars like Andrew Walder and Thomas Gold). In our OGL approach to research, we focus in on very specific cities, local political economies, and topics. In this post, we follow up on a meeting with one of the world’s leading economists, Professor Justin Lin. In that meeting Professor Lin, asked OGL to lay out our analysis of what was happening in China’s Consumption Economy development. This article is the fifth in a series of OGL analyses on this topic. In this post, we look at the issue of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and the shift from investment-led growth to consumption-led growth.
“Can KPIs Shift the ‘Political Tournament’ from Investment to Consumption?”(1)
On June 26 at the Summer Davos Forum in Tianjin, Keyu Jin, Professor of Finance at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), argued that China cannot become a truly affluent nation without transitioning to a consumption-driven economy (2). To facilitate this transition, she proposed redefining local competition by incorporating consumption-related metrics into the key performance indicators (KPIs) of local governments. This article – the fifth in OGL’s China Consumption Series – explores a central question: Can an effective performance evaluation mechanism be designed to motivate local officials to prioritize consumption as strongly as they do GDP growth? In our view (theOn Global Leadership,OGLview) we believe this can be done. Following our own OGL analysis and also the New Structural Economics Analysis of Professor Justin Lin(Justin Lin,林毅夫), we believe that scholars are thinking deeply about this key issue. The tensions among investment-led, economic development-led, and consumption-led growth are complicated. However, deep economic analysis and thoughtful development economic planning can lead to an economy that effectively works through all of these issues. We believe China is doing this today.
Performance Evaluation & KPI
Performance evaluation serves as a critical incentive mechanism within China’s governance system. Acting as a “baton,” it guides the transformation of the central government’s macro-strategic objectives into concrete policy actions at the local level. By directly linking evaluation outcomes to incentives such as official promotions and fiscal transfers, the system significantly enhances local governments’ responsiveness and efficiency in policy implementation.
The performance evaluation mechanism centers on establishing a robust KPI system. It transforms macro-level strategies into quantifiable, comparable, and actionable indicators, which are then integrated across all levels of governance – from public administration to official assessment. This process creates a closed-loop management cycle encompassing goal setting, decomposition, execution, evaluation, and continuous improvement, thereby effectively guiding resource allocation and shaping policy direction. Crucially, KPI selection must meet three criteria: indicators should accurately reflect progress, allow for timely measurement, and be resistant to data manipulation in order to ensure fairness and evaluation accuracy.
The Inadequacy of Existing Consumption Indicators
Incorporating consumption into economic development KPIs has now become imperative. Historically, local government evaluations have prioritized supply-side indicators such as GDP and fixed-asset investment, leading to a policy bias toward “investment over consumption.” Introducing consumption metrics into performance assessments would help rebalance the supply-demand structure and support the central government’s strategy to “vigorously boost consumption, improve investment efficiency, and comprehensively expand domestic demand.” However, a significant practical challenge persists: China lacks a comprehensive, accurate, and unified consumption statistics system, which directly undermines the feasibility of implementing this policy.
China’s consumption statistical system is still in development and currently lacks a comprehensive household consumption indicator that integrates both goods and services. The most authoritative and well-established metrics – recognized for their systematic nature, accessibility, and historical continuity – include Total Retail Sales of Consumer Goods (TRSCG), Per Capita Disposable Income and Consumption Expenditure, and Actual Final Consumption under GDP by expenditure approach. These indicators provide crucial macro-level insights into economic activity and living standards. However, each of these metrics has significant limitations and cannot be directly or effectively used as a KPI to evaluate local officials’ performance in promoting consumption:
TRSCG serves as a broad measure of consumption, encompassing physical goods (e.g., food, appliances, clothing) and limited services such as catering, with data released monthly and aggregated quarterly. However, it excludes major service sectors – including education, healthcare, culture and tourism, and eldercare – that account for over 40% of household consumption. Furthermore, a key methodological issue persists: consumption is attributed to the location of the business rather than the consumer, raising questions about TRSCG’s suitability as a performance metric for assessing local officials’ efforts to boost consumption.

Data on per capita disposable income and consumption expenditure are derived from household surveys. While these indicators reflect household purchasing power and actual consumption levels, they are influenced by numerous external factors – many of which are beyond local governments’ control – making observed changes difficult to attribute to officials’ policy efforts and risking distortions in performance evaluations.

Final consumption expenditure under the expenditure approach to GDP is updated annually, a frequency too low to support timely policy monitoring and responsiveness. Moreover, inconsistent statistical standards and limited regional comparability further constrain its applicability for dynamic governance and performance evaluation.

In summary, while incorporating consumption into the performance evaluations of local officials is a promising direction, assessing outcomes remains impractical in the near term due to the lack of comprehensive and reliable aggregate consumption data. A more feasible strategy would be to focus on evaluating the key processes and foundational conditions that influence consumption, particularly the existing bottlenecks.
The OGL Solution – Targeting Working Hours
The key to resolving these bottlenecks lies in fostering an environment conducive to consumption. This environment rests on three fundamental pillars: consumption capacity (having the financial means), leisure time (having the time and flexibility), and effective supply (the availability and cost-effectiveness of goods and services). Although consumption capacity and supply structure have received considerable attention, the essential component of leisure time, whether individuals have sufficient and discretionary time to spend, remains largely overlooked. Therefore, we believe that implementing shorter working hours and ensuring strict enforcement of paid leave policies can safeguard this right and represent a vital, actionable step toward stimulating domestic demand and unlocking consumer potential.
Data from January 2023 to August 2025 indicate that the average weekly working hours for enterprise employees exceeded 48, approaching the legal maximum. When including an additional 1–2 hours of daily commuting and 0.5–1 hour for lunch breaks, total weekly work-related time reaches 55–60 hours. After accounting for time spent on sleep and family responsibilities, individuals are left with fewer than 8 hours of “discretionary time” for personal consumption per week. This scarcity suppresses consumption through three interconnected mechanisms:
Severely compressed discretionary time directly limits consumption activities, especially in service-oriented sectors (such as dining, travel, and recreation) that depend on leisure time.Prolonged working hours lead to physical and mental exhaustion, reducing both the desire and capacity to consume. Time-constrained workers favor efficiency-driven consumption (such as fast food and online shopping for daily necessities) over development- and recreation-oriented consumption (such as education and entertainment).Insufficient leisure time causes workers to concentrate their vacations and consumption during holidays, intensifying seasonal congestion and thereby degrading the overall consumption experience.

3. Insufficient leisure time causes workers to concentrate their vacations and consumption during holidays, intensifying seasonal congestion and thereby degrading the overall consumption experience.
These effects collectively create a “time barrier” that hinders consumption expansion, highlighting the importance of sufficient leisure time as a fundamental prerequisite for sustained consumption growth.
From the perspective of removing consumption bottlenecks and enhancing policy effectiveness, reducing working hours is more feasible and practical than optimizing social security or increasing workers’ incomes. The advantage lies in its alignment with local governments’ implementation capacity, its controllable costs, and its measurable outcomes:
Low implementation threshold through existing systems: The Labor Law already mandates a 40-hour workweek, so local governments need only strengthen enforcement rather than undertake institutional reform, resulting in relatively lower resistance to implementation.Controllable costs with fewer burdens on public finance or enterprises: Improving social security requires fiscal expenditure, and increasing incomes depends on corporate profit-sharing – both of which often encounter resistance. In contrast, reducing working hours can be achieved by streamlining workflows and eliminating unproductive overtime, without necessarily increasing costs for either the government or businesses.Measurable outcomes suitable for KPIs: Metrics such as average weekly working hours and paid leave adoption rates are quantifiable and comparable. Furthermore, changes in working time can be directly correlated with shifts in consumption activity, enabling clear monitoring and policy evaluation.

Therefore, at this stage, enforcing existing working hour regulations represents a relatively low-cost and highly feasible policy measure. Incorporating “reducing weekly working hours” and “increasing paid leave adoption rates” into local consumption promotion assessments will not only address the “no time to consume” bottleneck but also signal a clear governance priority shift from “investing in physical capital” to “investing in people.” This strategic approach would incentivize greater corporate compliance and lay the groundwork for future reforms in income distribution and social security.
Some Final Thoughts
China’s persistent imbalance of “strong supply capacity versus weak domestic demand” is deeply rooted in the development priorities of governments at all levels. Emerging historically from a context of material scarcity, the economy became heavily reliant on factor-driven growth during decades of rapid expansion. In practice, policy has consistently prioritized production, directing resources into capacity building and capital accumulation, while neglecting the crucial role of consumption. Consumption has often been regarded as a “spontaneous market outcome” or even as a “depletion of wealth.” This perception has led to a systemic underestimation of consumption’s vital role in driving economic circulation and realizing commodity value.
However, with China’s establishment of a moderately prosperous society in 2021, the nation has entered a new stage of development. Adherence to the traditional mindset that “once production efficiency improves, consumption will naturally follow” not only fails to address the persistent shortfall in effective demand but also remains incapable of resolving the structural disconnect between production capacity and domestic demand.
It is essential to recognize that production constitutes the starting point of the economic cycle, while value realization represents its ultimate endpoint. Without robust consumption as support, no matter how high production efficiency rises or how extensively capacity expands, the final realization of value cannot be achieved. As Karl Marx pointed out, the “perilous leap from commodity to money” represents the most critical and fragile link in the economic cycle: should this leap fail, what is shattered is not merely the commodity itself, but the very foundation of the economy.
The September 2024 CPC Politburo meeting significantly elevated the priority of boosting consumption and expanding domestic demand, introducing new initiatives subsequently reflected in the 2025 local government work reports. Although systemic transformation cannot be achieved overnight, the strategic direction is now unmistakably clear.
We anticipate that during the 15th Five-Year Plan period (2026–2030), more people-centered policies – such as linking reductions in weekly working hours to local evaluations of consumption promotion – will be implemented across all levels of government, thereby steadily unlocking the potential of domestic demand. We are confident that China will accelerate its transition from a “global manufacturing powerhouse” to a “leading consumer nation,” ultimately emerging as the world’s largest and most dynamic consumer market.
Please keep an eye out for our next article on the cross-national comparisons of consumption economy issues. We will be posting this cross-national comparison analysis soon. With all best wishes from the OGL Team!
1. The “Political Tournament” theory, proposed by Professor Zhou Li’an of Peking University, explains the mechanisms through which local officials in China are incentivized and governed. The theory posits that, within China’s distinctive administrative system, higher-level governments evaluate and promote officials primarily based on quantifiable performance metrics such as GDP growth and social stability. This framework generates intense peer-level competition, which has been regarded as a key driver of China’s rapid economic growth, although it also comes with significant drawbacks.
