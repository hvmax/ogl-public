AtOn Global Leadership, we value the insights of our colleagues in China and the personal reflections they have shared with us and you during the coronavirus pandemic. This column about our colleagues’ recent experience after their four-year-old son has a fever is compelling. It also illuminates the requirements of a successful reopening in China or any country, for that matter. The strict adherence to government contact tracing rules and rigid health protocols for even the youngest among us will likely be the cost of the return to normalcy. The Editorial Team
Life With COVID:The Stresses of Attending Kindergarten
By Diane E. Long
The difficulty with an invisible enemy is, well, it’s invisible. We knew the day would come when we would have to sit down with the boys to talk about this. That day came the same week our youngest woke to a fever of 100.2F (38C) degrees, and Beijing announced an infection cluster of more than 40 new domestically transmitted COVID-19 cases. As the cities and towns around Shanghai lowered their alert levels, and the rules around face mask are reduced, it’s easy to be lulled into a false sense of safety.
COVID-19, the invisible enemy, is going to be with us for a long, long time.
We begin each day by taking the temperature of our four-year-old. We are required to report his temperature to his kindergarten teacher via a WeChat platform and through a separate online platform connected to our Health QR codes,where we also report our own health statuses. Generally, our son’s temperature is more or less in the acceptable range, and so we basically cut and paste the previous day’s details.
Suddenly, the rhythm of the week is interrupted by a temperature reading decidedly outside the range.What to do? First comes the ethical question: do we alert the school or not? As anyone who has had to care for a child knows there are fevers, and then there are serious ones that hang on for a couple of days. I am not embarrassed to say that it did cross our minds to hold off notifying the school. If you knew Chinese hospitals, you would forgive us for trying to avoid the long queues and crowds.
Our responsibility to the common good won the day. A few WeChat message exchanges with his teacher instructed us to start the process: retrieve from the school a form referred to as the “little white card” (小白卡), which as it turns out is anything but small being letter size. The forms are available at the security gate of the school 24/7. One does not obtain a form casually as one must sign a log to get the form, essentially starting a trail to track our movements.

A Trip to the Hospital
During a torrential downpour, we arrived at the Changning District Central Hospital. Recently upgraded, the facility signage alerts you to which door one must enter with a fever. Wearing our masks and having to show both our Health QR codes as well as the location tracker from the China telecom app, temperatures are taken yet again. Then we are directed to the fever clinic, which isolates anyone with a fever from the main hospital. We fill out forms, including the names and contact details of someone at the school, and then we are directed to a line for nucleic testing. Students, workers in factories, and everyone in between must show a negative nucleic test to be allowed back in circulation. Our four-year-old handled the swabbing of the throat and the nose with aplomb. As he remarked, it was just like what he saw on the TV news each evening.
Twenty-four hours later, the test results were delivered directly to the school, and our teacher advised us of the negative result for our son via WeChat. The last step was to have a doctor confirm all was well by filling in that little white card with the obligatory red chop. That meant a return trip to the hospital to find a doctor to sign-off on the report. And that fever? It was one of those summer ones that was gone in 24 hours.
We have restocked the disinfectant spray and changed all our masks. Additionally, to raise the awareness we’re using alcohol to wipe door handles, phone cases, and soap dispensers around the house. The daily number of new COVID-19 cases continues to develop in Beijing and intermittent imported cases are found on the few international flights coming into the country. One can feel a return to a bit higher level of awareness at metro stations and entrances to residential compounds. Still, no one can afford to let their guard down.
