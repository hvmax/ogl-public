AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy and, in particular, life in China. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. We have also written about thehistoryandcurrent stateof US-China relations. Recently, we have written about the 50th anniversary ofPresident Nixon's visit to Chinaand how U.S.-China relations have evolved over that period. At this time, it is impossible to not be considering the war on Ukraine and what is means for China and the transforming Geo-Political Ecosystem. In this post, we weigh into these issues. This post continues our exploration of the implications of the comments President Biden recently made over the China-Taiwan relationship.
By The On Global Leadership Team
Here at On Global Leadership, we are not politicians. We are businesspeople, researchers, writers, and advisors about China’s economic development and China’s changing role in the global political economy. But we were struck (not in a good way) by President Biden’s comments on U.S.-China-Taiwan relations.
In a briefing with a major U.S. corporation, corporate leaders asked us the question we all want answered: “What is going to happen? Is China going to annex Taiwan? What does this mean for U.S.-China relations? What does it mean for doing business in China?” At the time, one of our team member’s answer was: “Please keep calm. Things are going to be OK. Our economies are too deeply intertwined for a breakup, an economic Cold War, or outright military conflict. Neither country – the two largest economies in the world and the two largest trading partners in the world – can afford a conflict right now. It won’t happen.”
However, we have been disappointed by President Biden over and over again, and this past week reminded us of that fact. In a news conference in Japan, responding to the question of whether the United States “was willing to get involved militarily to defend Taiwan,” Biden confidently and quickly responded, “Yes.” The United States has long been a supporter of Taiwan, so to some, this might have seemed like an obvious answer to a simple question. However, this was a radical and, dare we say, irresponsible answer.
In addition to stumbling into a problematic relationship with China, the war in Ukraine has put even more distance between China and the west. We focus on leadership and geo-political issues as they relate to China, but this event has crucial implications not only for NATO and Europe but also for U.S.-China relations. The world has watched intently to see what  geopolitical role China would play in the conflict. Early last week, Biden flew to Asia – his first trip to the region as p resident – to meet with the “Quad” (U.S., Japan, Australia, and India), a group that China views as the NATO of the Pacific.
A Little History
It is important to briefly lay out the historical landscape here. At OGL, we have written about this history, but it is important to be very clear about the historical agreements and some of the tensions that have followed those agreements. We begin withRichard Nixon and the signing of the Shanghai Communique in 1972. The Shanghai Communique was one of the primary examples of “constructive ambiguity,” a notion that is often credited to Henry Kissinger. Essentially, this document laid the groundwork for the “One China” policy that acknowledged Taiwan is part of China. (Note: the use of the word "acknowledge" is widely regarded as a key example of Kissinger’s constructive ambiguity.)
The story continues with President Carter and Paramount Leader Deng Xiaoping signing of the Joint Communique on the Establishment of Diplomatic Relations in 1979. In signing the Joint Communique, the United States ended formal diplomatic relations with Taiwan. Within months of the Carter-Deng meeting, both houses of Congress had passed the Taiwan Relations Act (1979), which states that “the United States shall provide Taiwan with arms of a defensive character and shall maintain the capacity of the United States to resist any resort to force or other forms of coercion that would jeopardize the security, or social or economic system, of the people of Taiwan.” China has long maintained that the TRA was an “unwarranted intrusion” into China’s internal affairs.
As the U.S. and Chinese economies became increasingly integrated over the course of the next three decades, China entered the World Trade Organization (WTO), economic interests became more aligned, companies like GM, Apple, Dell, and Tesla, just to name a few, became very dependent on China. Engagement and diplomacy ruled the day. But make no mistake, China is adamant that Taiwan is a part of China. As we noted in an earlierpost, Chinese people and the Chinese government have a great deal of clarity around this issue.
In our view, engagement and diplomacy were superior approaches to developing a sane approach to cross-strait relations. The last decade has damaged the engagement approach on both sides. China clearly feels disrespected by not being treated as one of the most influential powerful economies in the world, yet remaining uninvited to the Group of 7 (G7) nations. Defenders of this decision often argue that the G7 was organized around advanced industrialized democratic market economies. This is a specious argument, because the group was expanded to include Russia – clearly not a democratic market economy – in 1997 (Russia was kicked out in 2014 with the invasion of Crimea).
The Trump era further damaged the engagement and diplomacy dynamic. A Trade War, tariffs, and the appointment of Peter Navarro as the Administration’s lead trade negotiator all had negative implications for the U.S.-China relationship.
We believed Biden would usher in corrective measures, bringing us back toward a stance of engagement, diplomacy, and mutual respect. Campbell's announcement of the “end of engagement” with China was damaging. In addition, Biden’s repeated gaffes only inflame U.S.-China relations. Further, the founding of the “Quad” is clearly set to send a signal of counterbalancing China’s influence in the region. Similar to the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP), the Quad concept has much more of a NATO feel in its orientation.
If Biden’s gaffes are truly gaffes – this seems to be the case as the White House has repeatedly “walked back” the statements acknowledging that these statements do not reflect US policy – then Biden is just a sloppy leader. If these statements are strategic, we believe it is a dangerous strategy and is likely to inflame the issue. Fortunately, the evidence suggests that there are officials within the Biden Administration – from the White House to the Department of State – who possess a nuanced understanding of the package of policies that have shaped US-China relations for the last four decades. And even though he does not return to the language of engagement, Secretary of State Blinken’s recent clean up job indicates that there are leaders in the Biden Administration that do possess a nuanced understanding of the package of policies that have guided US-China relations for the last four decades.
In sum, there are several reasons for the United States to continue on a path of constructive and diplomatic engagement. First, a Cold War with China would be economically disastrous for both countries, but the U.S. would probably be hurt more. China is the second largest market for Apple, Tesla, and many other large American corporations. The risk is not just that these corporate giants would lose the benefits of China’s supply chain, which is now larger, more integrated and more sophisticated than any supply chain in the world. If Apple’s or Tesla’s or Walmart’s access to China’s supply were collateral damage of a U.S.-China Cold War, the economics for these companies would change dramatically.
Second, if the United States seeks to work with China on constructive outcomes for the region and for the world, respectful, diplomatic engagement is essential. This approach brought the United States and China together into closer partnership throughout the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s.
The question as we see it is: does Biden want to follow Trump down the path of antagonism and disruption with China, or does he want to be a leader who finds a way to bring the globe's largest economies together to better serve and safeguard the world? Our hope is that Biden forges a path as a world leader building on engagement and diplomacy.
