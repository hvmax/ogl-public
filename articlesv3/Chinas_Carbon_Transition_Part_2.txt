### China's Carbon Transition - Part 2

29 October 2023|China, Climate Change, Economic Development, Innovation, Smart Manufacturing
AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy and, in particular, life in China. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. We have written about economic development in China and China’s economic reforms, US-China relations, China’s changing role in the global political economy, and the history and current state of Chinese politics. In this post, we follow up on our Part 1 discussion of China's aspirations for a carbon neutral future, exploring innovations that are already distinguishing China's environmental leadership.
As discussed in Part 1, China's ambitious carbon goals has set the stage for a major transformation in the way that China secures and uses energy. By striving to achieve carbon neutrality before 2060, China has set as a goal the reduction of its carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP by over 65 percent from the 2005 level by 2030.
Is China’s ambition credible? China’s carbon-neutrality pledge is on a very different scale than those proposed by other nations, requiring China to achieve an unprecedented reduction in carbon emissions in a remarkably short period of time for a growing economy.
Policies and Implementation
As China’s quest for carbon neutrality is accompanied by its growing economic scale and energy demand, what China has launched is one of the biggest ambitions set for the next 40 years, realizing these goals will not be an easy task. China’s approach is similar to what generations of Chinese leaders have done in past decades:
Announce a bold vision and then figure out how to attain it through structured experimentation and careful iterations.Implement throughout the country via a top-down policy framework, e.g. From documents issued by Communist Party of China (CPC) central committee, five-year plans to implementation schemes in key areas and sectors.Encourage competition by rewarding officials who are performing, criticizing or punishing the laggards.
1. Announce a bold vision and then figure out how to attain it through structured experimentation and careful iterations.
2. Implement throughout the country via a top-down policy framework, e.g. From documents issued by Communist Party of China (CPC) central committee, five-year plans to implementation schemes in key areas and sectors.
3. Encourage competition by rewarding officials who are performing, criticizing or punishing the laggards.
In the governance system of China, political philosophy (1) is the fundamental guiding ideology of the CPC, based on which political strategies are built. CPC requests “strategic decisions made by the Party Central Committee be enforced fully, faithfully and unconditionally” (2). Now that Eco-civilization is essential to Xi Jinping’s new development philosophy, achieving “dual carbon” goal has become a key national strategy made by CPC and a new rule of action for local authorities and government departments when they plan their work and decide on actions, governments at all levels are requested to work out clear timetables, roadmaps and execution plans.
To realize “dual carbon” goal, China has put in place a “1+N” policy framework. The “1” refers the guidance and the top-level design, it consists of the two documents issued in 2021(see figure 2) which articulate the schedules, road maps and working procedures. “N” is the implementation schemes in key areas and sectors, all provinces and central enterprises, coupled with supporting measures.
In order to strengthen the coordination of carbon dioxide peaking and carbon neutrality, in 2021, the central government established a working group headed by Han Zheng (then member of CPC Politburo Standing Committee and Executive Vice Premier of the State Council), supported by working groups at each province headed by respective governor.
The 14th FYP is a key policy instrument to realize near term (2021-2025) “dual carbon” goals. Among 20 target indicators set in the 14th FYP, reducing energy consumption and CO₂ emission per unit of GDP by 13.5% and 18% respectively, increase forest cover rate by 0.9% are 3 out of 8 obligatory indicators.
To summarize: The 1+N policy framework sets the targets for the whole country and key areas, establishes China's working mechanism to implement the “dual carbon” goal. According to this policy framework, China must achieve the following goals to realize carbon peak before 2030:
1.  From 2020 to 2030, limit the average annual energy consumption growth rate at1.8%, control the total energy consumption in 2030 within 6 billion tcf (3).
2.  Undertake a faster transition towards non-fossil energy, reduce the share of coal in the generating fuel mix. Rely on renewable energy for incremental energy consumption by 2030.
3.  Promote a resource-saving and eco-friendly industry model and lifestyle, create a system for the effective recycling of resources.
Judging from the practice in recent years, however, China does not have the environment to pursue carbon neutrality at a high socio-economic cost. Chinese leaders still struggle to balance growth and economic interests with achieving climate goals. So far, the most effective way to implement 1+N policy framework is still traditional administrative measures.
Target Responsibility System (TRS)
Target Responsibility System (TRS) is the main administrative instrument in China’s policy-first and administrative-led top-down governance model. The promotion of “dual carbon” goal has the same approach.
In the industrial sector, the largest source of carbon emissions, ministries in Beijing mainly give instructions to eliminate backward production capacity under the framework of TRS. From 2006 to 2015, quantified goals are set in industries such as electric power, steel, building materials, electrolytic aluminum, ferroalloy, calcium carbide, coke, coal and flat glass. During the 13th FYP period (2016-2020), eliminating backward production capacity has become a regular work and the administrative approach has undergone some obvious changes: as long as national objective can be achieved, instead of telling local authorities what to do, the latter are given more flexibility to set their own goals. The central government has also brought in more market-oriented incentive measures such as specific incentive funds, differential electricity prices, and supporting credit, etc.
Although TRS usually functions, it is difficult for such pressure transfer mechanism to become a spontaneous drive of local governments and affected people in the work. Due to their weak position during goal setting, local governments, especially at the county level or below, have assumed responsibilities that do not match their administrative authority. As the interests of grassroots practitioners are often not fully aligned with those of higher-level officials, the effectiveness of policy implementation is often questioned, because so-called “there is a policy, there is a countermeasure” mentality (8). For many officials, they would rather do something that prevents being accounted for rather than something helps their promotion.
Given China's vast territory and uneven development between regions, how to balance the interests and set goals acceptable to all parties is always a challenge for policymakers. Figure 3 shows the gaming on goal setting and final attainment on energy consumption reduction. The State Council raised goal for 12 provinces which originally set a goal below national target. Three provinces setting aggressive goals way beyond national target had to apply for a reduction after two years as they just couldn’t make it, their application was approved.
But overall, as long as the will to promote a policy from central leadership has not changed, TRS has proved to be effective. The party’s political philosophy has a greater impact on the behavior of officials,
China’s Solar Photovoltaic Industry – A Case Study
The solar photovoltaic (PV) industry is playing a critical role in China’s energy transformation, one of the few strategic emerging industries China believes that they have global competitive advantages in terms of technology, supply chain and market size.
Solar PV power generation is the process of converting energy from the sunlight into electricity using solar panels. In 1839, a French physicist Edmund Bequerel observed the photoelectric effect. In 1905, Albert Einstein discovered the theory of “photoelectric effect”, on which PV technology is based and won him Nobel prize in physics. In 1954, Bell Laboratories demonstrated the first practical silicon solar cell that could convert 6% of the energy in sunlight directly to electricity. In the 1960s, the space industry pioneered the PV technology to power satellites. The 1970’s through the 1990’s saw slow but steady applications of PV technology as energy source. In the 1990’s, the first grid-supported solar PV system was completed in California. In the 21st century, as PV technology becomes increasingly affordable and available, it is considered as a major source of low-carbon energy and is playing an increasingly important role in the global energy transformation.
China owns the vast majority of the world’s solar panel supply chain by controlling at least 75% of every single key stage of solar PV panel manufacturing and processing.7 out of the top 10 companies producing polysilicon, including the top three, are from China, its share on Solar-grade polysilicon has increased from about 30 percent 10 years ago to over 80% in 2022. The steps that turn polysilicon into ingots, wafers, cells, and solar modules are dominated by China as well. What’s more, the top 10 suppliers of solar PV manufacturing equipment are also Chinese. We must give credit to China for the exponential cost decrease and production capacity increase in the last decade, which allows solar power to compete with other sources of power generation. Its success is a result of the coincidence between top-down industry policy and bottom-up entrepreneurship. Through constant trial and error, every party, from governments to start-ups and investors, learn, adjust, and improve from practices, the lucky ones have survived and thrived.
China’s early solar PV industry policy was a failure. As the policy supported mainly the supply side and the cultivation of the domestic market was somewhat ignored, it eventually led to blind expansion and serious overcapacity. As a result, the entire industry almost collapsed after losing export markets because of anti-dumping and anti-subsidy measures. Adjusted policy in 2013 focused on expanding the domestic market to help the industry to reduce export dependence. In 2018, with the recovery of solar PV industry and the forming of competitive advantage, the government decisively set the goal of grid parity and reducing subsidies. While the new policy has encountered problems like cheating for subsidies, the fall of some major manufacturers because of technology failure, it has helped the making of a global leading photovoltaic industry for China.
In an effort to reduce the dependence on China, large economies including India and the United States, are investing heavily in the domestic manufacturing capacity of solar PV modules. The resurgence of supply chain sovereignty suggests that security concerns have overrode climate change concerns. Against these head winds, we also see cooperation. American clean energy developer Invenergy announced to partner with Long on a 5-GW solar panel assembly factory in Pataskala, Ohio. The construction will begin in April 2023.
To conclude, the path of China’s solar PV industry is to invest huge amounts of manpower, financial resources and time to continuously test and improve existing technologies, keep building capacity to meet growing market demand, add up many small victories to a big one. While industry policy plays an important role, the winners are those lucky ones who standout from fierce market competition. Looking ahead, China will work in the following directions to maintain its leading position of solar PV industry:
Continue to improve product quality and product efficiency, enhance customer experience.Continue to strengthen solar PV supply chain and maintain absolute cost advantage.Continue to invest heavily in R&D, work on different technical routes in parallel to ensure the mastery of core technologies.
1. Continue to improve product quality and product efficiency, enhance customer experience.
2. Continue to strengthen solar PV supply chain and maintain absolute cost advantage.
3. Continue to invest heavily in R&D, work on different technical routes in parallel to ensure the mastery of core technologies.
Looking to the Future
In the past decades, China has forged ahead with boosting the economy, improving people's livelihoods, and alleviating poverty. China is also proving that the efforts to protect the environment and tackle climate change, rather than being obstacles of economic growth, are new drivers of high-quality development. The Chinese leaders are clear that its “dual carbon” goal will be achieved through real and concrete actions that facilitate the transformation of its economic growth model as well as pattern of consumption and everyday life.
China needs to promote innovation and cooperation to achieve its climate targets, with the contributions from its people, especially the youth, for an eco-friendly way of production and life. Although such transformation will be difficult, it is an opportunity for China to demonstrate leadership towards a zero-carbon world. What happens in China will go a long way towards shaping the outcome of global efforts to reduce carbon emissions and mitigate the worst-case climate scenarios. The nation has shown commitment and efforts, we wish these efforts to succeed, China is not alone in this journey.
