On September 2nd, 2025, China’s President, Xi Jinping, hosted Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong Un for a military parade, a celebration tied to the 80-year anniversary of the end of WWII. Leading up to this parade, there were also meetings between Kim and Putin, Putin and Indian leader Narendra Modi, and Xi and Modi. This is a significant moment in the organization of the global political economy. The US has very likely fomented the growth and strengthening of these relationships, as the current administration has weakened the US influence with these countries – particularly China and India – as we have unleashed aggressive tariffs on these and many other countries. We have written about these relationships as they relate to the global trading issues extensively (see, e.g.,here,here,here,here, andhere). Today, we are watching China move more aggressively into its role as the leader of the “Global South.” This continues a process that has been under for the last two years, since the BRICS expansion, which began in August of 2023. At On Global Leadership, we analyze these issues, but we also advocate that the world pay attention to what is happening in China today and the implications these moments may have for a reorganization of the global political economy.
In our work atOn Global Leadership(OGL), we think deeply about the questions of Leadership, China’s Economic Development, US-China Relations, Investment in China, and China’s growing role as a leader in the Global Political Economy. We have written about these issues extensively (see, e.g.,here,here,here,here, andhere). But we also take interest in using our research and on-the-ground connections to give us a sense of what is happening right now, in the moment: Thus, OGL Real Time. In this article, we want to give our readers a sense of what is happening in China today, given the recent political movements and meetings. Given the important political activities and meetings in the last two weeks, we are reporting now about the recent meetings and events in Beijing. Questions and answers from the OGL team are below.
Question 1: From late August to early September 2025, China successfully hosted the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) Tianjin Summit and a massive military parade in central Beijing to mark the 80th anniversary of its victory in the Chinese People’s War of Resistance against Japanese Aggression and the World Anti-Fascist War, along with a series of multilateral and bilateral diplomatic activities. How have Chinese netizens viewed these two major events?
Answer: The SCO Tianjin Summit is a multilateral diplomatic event, while the V-Day parade highlights China’s military strength and modern capabilities. Public interest in the two events varies, with the parade drawing significantly more attention than the Summit. Facing a flood of social media content, we have chosen three key aspects to present to our readers.
1. New Reality: China hosted 31 heads of state and government within a week, including prominent leaders such as Vladimir Putin, Narendra Modi, Kim Jong-un, and Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. Although the number of Western leaders was muchfewerthan at the 2015 V-Day parade, Beijing remains a key venue for global leaders to discuss international affairs.
2. Military Parade: It’s easy to see why the military parade drew more attention than the Tianjin Summit. Beyond the event itself, the display of new weapons sparked the most online discussion, with social media filled with sarcasms that the newly displayed much advanced weaponries turned the military enthusiasts to “military rookies” who had no words to say. The global reach of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) is seen as a symbol of great power status, and the parade showcased several highly targeted weapons including ICBMs capable of reshaping the military balance in the Western Pacific and beyond. As Professor Shen Yi from Fudan University put it, “At the strategic level… all military, economic, and political objectives of the U.S. and its allies are within China’s strategic deterrence range” (1). Many also speculate that the Pentagon’s new defense strategy (Figure 2) has been influenced by the parade.
3. International Reactions: the reactions from various countries to these two events have also sparked widespread interest, with Trump’s viewing of the parade broadcast has attracted special attention. His later decision to change the Department of Defense to the “Department of War,” however, was widely mocked as “between transform and reform, he chose rename.” (Figure 3)
Overall, netizens have expressed positive views toward China hosting these two major events, which demonstrated its political, diplomatic, and military strength. In particular, the success of the V-Day military parade significantly boosted public morale in China.
Question 2: Indian Prime Minister Modi’s visit to China after a seven-year gap was a highlight and focal point of the Tianjin Summit. How are Chinese netizens decoding the “interest equation” behind his “Tianjin posture”?
Answer: This particular meeting is a“Big Deal”. In our view, the Trump Administration has, in effect, “pushed” Modi and India into the Xi and China-India collaboration. The bottom line is that the Trump Administration tariffs, which include India, have created a realignment of the BRICS Coalition and the Global South. In our view, essentially, the Trump Administration has sought to use tariffs to raise prices for imported commodities, thus incentivizing manufacturers to build supply chain – and thus jobs – in America. As we have argued previously, this is a silly exercise, because it will take decades (literally) to build the manufacturing supply chains that exist in China and are now being built in India. Nevertheless, if the current Administration aspires to build a more tendentious relationship with China, it would then make sense to build a deeper relationship with India. However, the Trump Administration has put tariffs on every nation (allies and adversaries alike), so we have pushed forward a collaboration a coalition of all of these nations. Just as an aside, we are talking about coalitions of 40% of the world’s population here. The question for the United States is: are we going to be collaborative partners with these nations or are we going develop a “New Economic Cold War” (OGL article coming on this) with these important nations? We are looking forward to seeing what happens, and we are looking forward to helping the United States (and China and BRICS) making the right decisions around these issues. Now, what is our OGL China Team seeing on these issues?
On Chinese social media, mainstream opinions regarding Indian Prime Minister Modi’s visit to China, his first in seven years, are characterized by pragmatism and caution.
Netizens generally interpret Modi’s visit within the dynamic framework of China-U.S.-India trilateral relations, a result of Trump’s bullying. The Trump administration increased tariffs on Indian exports to the United States from 25% to 50%, citing India’s purchase of Russian oil, directly hit India’s export and companies in the supply chain. Chinese netizens observe that India had previously leaned toward the U.S. within the “Indo-Pacific Strategy,” but Washington’s economic pressure on New Delhi has revealed its tendency to treat allies as instrumental tools rather than equal partners.
Chinese netizens recognize India as an independent and major power, one of the key poles in today’s multipolar world. So far, India has demonstrated greater resilience than Europe in the face of the Trump’s tariff wars. In Tianjin, Modi showcased that India possesses strategic options beyond the United States, as evidenced by its cordial interactions with both Russian President Putin and Chinese leader.
Of course, many netizens have also warned about India’s “opportunistic” tendencies, emphasizing that its strategic shifts are primarily motivated by national self-interest. Prior to his visit to China, Modi visited Japan, where the Japan-India joint statement explicitly referred to “maritime threats,” implicitly targeting China. While the improvement of Sino-Indian relations aligns with China’s interests, it is crucial to maintain a clear understanding of India’s “tactical” nature.

Question 3: How will Beijing handle the Taiwan issue after the September 3rd military parade?
Answer: This parade marked China’s most powerful military demonstration to date, prompting many netizens to naturally link it to the Taiwan issue and speculate on whether the reunification process will speed up. Others counter that as mainland strength grows, the risks of Taiwanese independence and foreign intervention decrease, thereby lessening both the need and likelihood of military reunification. KOL Hu Xijin (胡锡进) wrote the following in his Weibo post:A scholar from the United States, who is not pro-mainland China, told the BBC that through this military parade, “people now have a general idea that the People’s Liberation Army is very strong. So, some will feel they have to rely on the United States, while others, the solution lies in cross-strait communication. Of course, there will also be those who believe that there’s nothing that can be done and they can only wait to be unified.”
The key question now is how long China is willing to wait to reunify the island. If the goals outlined at the 20th CPC National Congress are met, China’s GDP will surpass that of the United States by 2035 and be roughly twice as large by 2049. Based on this projection, we estimate that the period from 2035 to 2049 could be the window for reunification.
