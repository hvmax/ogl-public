### "Triangle of Sadness" & Everyday Leadership

6 March 2023|Culture, Everyday Leadership, Leadership
We continue our series of pieces asking what we can learn about leadership from the Oscar-nominated Best Picture films announced by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Like most of you, we are moved by the culture around us, and often we learn from that culture. We decided to take a look at the 10 nominated films and see what insights about leadership we can glean from the characters, themes, or locations. Our next contribution in this series is about the uneven "Triangle of Sadness."
"Triangle of Sadness": Finding Leadership in the Unlikeliest of Places
By Sarah Kellogg
Unlike the cheery three-hour tour from the popular "Gilligan's Island" TV series, where the rich and the poor are marooned  in seeming harmony, the "Triangle of Sadness" takes its cast on a doomed luxury cruise that proves more profound in its examination of class divisions. The dark satire also experiments with the notion of leadership, offering insight into who is called to lead and why when circumstances grow dire.
For this post, we're only focusing on the third act of the movie, where the most interesting action happens. Caveat: This isn't a movie review, but if it was, we wouldn't recommend the film. Despite director Ruben Östlund's lofty goal of illuminating the punishing gap between the haves and have nots, the movie is uneven, degrading, and even boring at points. And don't be fooled by claims of its humor; it's humor would delight tween boys obsessed with bodily fluids.
Back to the action. After a chaotic night aboard the luxury yacht, a pirate crew sneaks on board to hijack the ship and instead accidentally blows the boat up. A handful of the passengers and staff make it to shore on a small island. Without food, water, and any idea of where they are, chaos reigns. At first, the rules of the ship are transferred to the island. Wealthy people are waited on by the two staff members who survived the explosion, and everyone seems to be fine with that order.

Then one of the ship's cleaning crew, Abigail (Dolly De Leon), realizes that she is the only one on the island who knows how to fish, start a fire, and survive. She starts her own mutiny, and refuses to do any more work for the collected cast of characters until she is acknowledged as the small colony's leader. After a brief argument, she gets her way, and she becomes their leader, due entirely to her knowledge.
Everyday Leadership is built on the thought that leaders are not born but rather forged in the day-to-day work of organizations. Only by mastering organizational and human complexity can leaders align strategy with dynamics to build a successful organization. Leaders must know themselves to better serve their peers.

For Abigail, the realization that she was the only person with the knowledge to survive on the island -- for herself and everyone else -- empowered her to rise to leadership, even if she twisted arms to get there. Eventually, her peers accept her in this new role, even as she steps over the line occasionally in enforcing her power.
The director disrupts this complicated situation at the end of the film, leaving us to wonder how she feels about a potential change in her status. It's here where Abigail would benefit from one of our courses in Everyday Leadership. Her leadership may be short-lived
