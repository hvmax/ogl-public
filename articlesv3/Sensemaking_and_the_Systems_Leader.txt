This is the fourthentry in a multi-partOn Global Leadershipseries on Systems Leadership. Ourprevious postextended a critical discussion of the "Great Man Myth" that lingers in both contemporary research and popular understanding of leaders.It formulatedan alternative view of collective and everyday leadership, “The Systems Leader,” who navigates and acts across theLeadership System,theContextual System,and theEnvironmental System.In the following entry, we explore Sensemaking as a crucial means for the Systems Leader to adapt to and address the dynamic changes in these interdependent systems.
By Sara Beckman and David Slocum
The Fourth Industrial Revolution combined with the Coronavirus pandemic are forcing leaders across nearly all private and public sectors to take a step back and reassess their positions in therapidly changing systems in which they operate. This necessarily raises questions as to how we think about leadership, and suggests a reformulation that moves us away from the persistentGreat Man myththat has historically dominated our views of leadership. Leaders today dynamically respond to and operateLeadership Systems, Contextual SystemsandEnvironmental Systemsby understanding those systems, appreciating their complexity and the opportunities that that complexity can offer, and executing change that both affects and is affected by those systems.
To be effective as aSystems Leader,engaging both adaptive and disruptive capacities, requires that the leader develop strong skills in both Selfmaking and Sensemaking. Selfmaking entails observing and understanding one’s values, experiences, traits, and tendencies; orienting, deciding, and acting in specific contexts based on those aspects of one’s character; and, in the process, learning and adapting oneself to changing conditions. (We will unpack this notion in a subsequent post.) Sensemaking requires that leaders take in information from the world around them -- salient elements of all three systems -- and use that information to discern new dynamics and opportunity spaces. We unpack Sensemaking in this post.
Sensemaking is a “a motivated, continuous effort to understand connections…in order to anticipate their trajectories and act effectively” (Klein and Moon2006, p. 71).Nissley(2010) describes three sensemaking modalities.
The first is to interpret the stimuli based upon our own experience and personal mythology and project what it means to us out onto the world. This is usually unconscious and is often deeply problematic as our sensemaking of the world tells us far more about ourselves than it does about the rest of the world. The second method is to invoke science and analytic reasoning, carefully reducing the stimuli to numbers (if possible), reducing the numbers to trends and causal relationships, and then acting based upon this analytic representation of the world. The third is the approach of the arts, which is to pay careful attention to the stimuli and listen deeply with the whole self for the meaning and then represent that meaning with an artistic form (novel, painting, dance, etc.) that captures the complexity and offers an essence of that complexity (Nissley 2010, p. 11).
Nissley’s characterization captures the deep inner focus (Goleman 1995) -- indeed, the profound self-understanding -- needed for effective and “accurate” sensemaking as well as the essence of the difference between the analytical perspective of sensemaking and the design (arts) view. His characterization does not, however, ask us (as practitioners) to select one as the single right approach. Rather his description suggests that we have options, even though it does not provide an explanation as to when each of the options would be more appropriately applied or in what ways they might be brought together. The following elaborates several ways that different dimensions of sensemaking can support and guide leaders in their interactions with complex systems.
A Sensemaking Metaphor: The Dance Floor and the Balcony
In 2009,Ronald Heifetz, Alexander Grashow, and Marty Linskyof the Harvard Kennedy School offered a compelling metaphor for leadership perspective: the dance floor and the balcony. On the dance floor, the leader immerses herself in action-taking and decision-making and builds credibility and relationships. With colleagues and teams, clients and investors, the successful leader participates fully in the ongoing dance of business. Specifically, she understands current activities – what’s working, and what’s not – and some immediate future adjustments. A particular benefit of being on the dance floor is an appreciation for other people, what is being asked of them, and what they are feeling. Without this direct engagement, a leader can forget what the work is about, lose connection with others, and exhaust herself dealing with recurring problems. Yet that immersion in immediate priorities can make gaining broader or longer-term perspective difficult if not impossible.
For Heifetz and his co-authors, the balcony becomes the second space from which a fuller view and appreciation of everyday work and the possible worlds beyond it can take place. The balcony provides a different perspective from the dance floor. From there, the leader can see patterns and extract insights not visible in the flurry on the dance floor. There, the leader can see potential new connections, evaluate the relevance of work and the nature of relationships. While work done on the dance floor may successfully devise solutions to problems, the balcony view allows the leader to ask if those problems are the right or best ones to be solved. It is critical to realize that stepping to the balcony is not the same as stepping away from action or toward passivity. Heifetz, in fact, describes the balcony-dance floor dynamic as “reflecting in action.” The two spaces are inextricably connected and a successful leader needs to determine how to coordinate her active presence in both. The balcony offers perspective and room to imagine; the dance floor is for direct observation and intervention.
The distance and perspective of the balcony captures what researchers callmetacognition. Since the late-1970s, when it was defined by developmental psychologistJohn H. Flavell, the term has generally referred to the awareness and regulation of one’s thinking. Metacognition has several dimensions: knowledge about one’s own (or others’) thinking, activities and procedures that shape and affect one’s learning, and the ability to determine when contextual knowledge or activities could relate to one’s current thinking or learning.
For leaders, knowledge of context can refer to various essential aspects of team and organizational work: awareness of one’s own and others’ capabilities, differentiating competence from confidence, and even determining what isn’t known. Task or strategic knowledge is likewise often vital to collective efforts and improvement, as a basis of both business continuity and pivoting to new and innovative alternatives. Better learning and decision-making, including around ethical or moral issues, are fundamental to effective leadership of people and projects. Especially over time, achieving and managing a distance from immediate participation in business activities can spur changes in thinking and overall engagement. Besides self-monitoring and self-regulation, metacognition can also relate to the self-representation of one’s thinking and reasoning.
After establishing what their own dance floor and balcony are, of course, it is vital for leaders to determine when to step from one to the other and for how long. Everyone needs to establish a different rhythm for moving between the dance floor and the balcony in different situations -- some of which, like the Coronavirus pandemic, make it much harder for many leaders to access the dance floor. In part, this involves making sense of relationships with others and of the various relevant organizational, market, and societal variables currently constituting theContextual System. At the same time, leadership must engage the unknown. It must envision new opportunities and, by exploring theEnvironmental Systemfor previously unrealized resources and unrecognized pathways forward, determine the future shape and direction of the team or organization. Throughout, leaders themselves learn and adapt, adjusting how they gain perspective and intervene in action, when and how they move between dancefloor and balcony. This involves leadershipSelfmaking, which we will explore in a future piece.
Sensemaking Capabilities: Observing/Noticing and Framing/Reframing
Sensemaking occurs both on the dance floor and in the balcony requiring, as Heifetz wrote, engagement in “active reflection”.  On the dance floor, Sensemaking requires that leaders develop basic capabilities in observing and noticing, taking in information of various sorts; while in the balcony, it demands capabilities in framing and reframing, abstracting from the day-to-day to see situations and opportunities from different perspectives. There is a broad literature to draw upon to better understand these two sets of capabilities.
Being astute observers and gaining perspective requires putting aside biases, actively listening, asking open-ended and probing questions, and eliciting and capturing stories (Payne2013). It also means looking at data with a critical eye, carefully forming hypotheses about causal relationships. “Sensitive, accurate observing is an essential skill of both scientists and artists,” but it requires both self-control and patience (Meadows2008). Just as the “beginnings of science are always the capacity to be able to be amazed by apparently simple things” (Chomsky1995), the beginnings of sensemaking are the ability to see the often obvious and simple things that structure human experience (Weiss1994). Put simply, Sensemaking begins with the observations that occur on the dance floor, where leaders gather inputs.
Moving to the balcony, Sensemaking continues as leaders step back to reflect on their experience on the dance floor to frame and reframe the challenges and possibilities. Framing is “both a cognitive device and a communicative activity defined by selection, emphasis, interpretation, and exclusion” (Fairhurst2005, p 167). Importantly, as leadership communications researcherGail Fairhurstwrites,
[Framing] is the ability to shape the meaning of a subject, to judge its character and significance. To hold the frame of a subject is to choose one meaning (or set of meanings) over another. When we share our frames with others (the process of framing), we manage meaning because we assert that our interpretations should be taken as real over other possible interpretations” (Fairhurst 2005, p 166).
For team or organizational leadership, framing not only identifies priorities for attention and action, it imbues those priorities (operational tasks, team or user engagements, performance or market targets) with meanings and purpose related to the entity’s larger strategic aims and vision. In the process, which is fundamentally interactive, framing establishes the language and terms of communication used in everyday leadership and team operations.
TheSystem Leaderis, crucially, a problem framer, as taking a systems view of a situation provides multiple different perspectives of a problem space, not just a single point of view (Dam and Siang2017). Systems thinking (Forrester1958,Senge1990) offers specific approaches to framing and reframing problems. Through visualization of a messy system, leaders and others can determine patterns of behavior and identify leverage points for creating change in the system. How the system is perceived can vary according to how a given stakeholder engages it. Thus, systems thinking requires understanding the various stakeholders involved, mapping the system dynamics from each of their perspectives, and then examining the patterns of interactions to determine in what ways the behaviors and interactions of the system might be improved (Sterman2000).
Sensemaking, particularly as aSystems Leader, is not about illuminating some unchanging and immutable essence or truth but understanding the shifting dynamics and changing patterns of messy systems. Leadership uses sensemaking to identify and prioritize salient variables and resources and, in doing so, to regularly map and redraw the boundaries of theirContextualandEnvironmental Systems. That ongoing work -- of building a safe and innovative culture, revising operational processes, reinventing business models, entering new markets -- shapes the activities and drives the impact and results of teams and organizations. It is work that requires meaningful and continuous collective learning and adapting teams and organizations to changing contexts. YetSensemakingalso relies on the growth and adaptation of leadership itself, whoseSelfmakingis a similarly ongoing learning process.
Sensemaking to Manage Dynamics between Contextual and Environmental Systems
Dialogue is crucial to the toggle between balcony and dance floor as well as in managing the constantly changing boundaries betweenContextualandEnvironmental Systems.  Dialogue involving inquiry, divergence, and convergence is at the heart of teams and organizations that successfully seek and then act upon alternative frames. Inquiry forces individuals and groups to uncover assumptions (Schein1999) and acknowledge the limitations of their own existing perspectives. Diverging generates and acknowledges the legitimacy of alternative viewpoints. Converging negotiates meanings, shared mental models, and common understandings of a situation (Oliver and Jacobs2007). In this way, dialogue intentionally leverages and exploits the diversity of perspectives and heuristics in a group (Page2007). Engaging in meaningful dialogue requires developing and acting upon an awareness of oneself, other persons, and situational variables (Goleman2013).
A key outcome of sensemaking is a set of collective and emotionally connecting narratives (Beckman and Barry2009) that can be readily articulated and then used to guide decision-making in organizations (Oliver and Jacobs 2007). Understanding the dialogic process of constructing that set of narratives has been an essential aspect of advancing learning across organizations (Agryris1982). In short, leadership must continually determine the information, data, and the narratives drawn from them that become priorities in theContextual System. Essential to that ongoing process are also decisions about what arenotpriorities deserving the allocation of precious organizational time, talent, and other resources. Leaders do not frame and reframe alone, in other words, they do so collectively and through dialogue with others.
Learning in this way involves leadership paying attention broadly to political, economic, social, environmental, technical and other macro-level trends and immersing themselves with others -- whether customers, users, followers or other stakeholders -- to develop deep understanding of lived experiences. This is the universe of possible factors that we refer to as theEnvironmental System.For aSystems Leader, central to the ongoing work is the identification and drawing on a few possibilities in order to make them salient priorities in theContextual System. While those possibilities may include data, ideas, and models, which together shape narratives, it is crucial to realize that including them in the redrawn boundaries of theContextual Systemmeans taking concrete and material action. It means shifting the responsibilities of people on teams, engaging new or potential users, devising new processes, and pursuing the full range of specific activities appropriate to building a given team or organization.
A practical challenge of exploring systems leadership involves adequately scanning the vast field of possibilities in the macro-environment and acting upon the set of situational variables salient in given contexts. Among the risks we face, as leaders or analysts, is the creation of standardized checklists of environmental or contextual factors for every situation. Oftentimes, this approach selectively highlights specific elements that support a fixed narrative or prioritizes an abstract system to the extreme point of excluding the human decisions and relationships. Instead, leaders are increasingly called upon to identify the “dominant beliefs” by which their industries and organizations are run and then to imagine possibilities that might come from disrupting them (de Jong and van Dij2015). Phillips, for example, asked what would happen if it were to sell lumens rather than light bulbs.
Considerthe experience of Jesse DesJardinswho turned the norms of tourism advertising on their heads when he joined Tourism Australia (TA) as their Social Media & Advocacy Manager in 2010. Why, he reasoned, not use social media instead of traditional marketing to attract visitors to experience the wonders of Australia. His insight of crowdsourcing “ads” from User Generated Content (UGC) instead of having an agency vendor create them and TA own them was anathema to the industry at the time. To realize it, and tired of engaging in tasks like taking screenshots of Facebook pages to put in PowerPoint presentations, Jesse went to his boss with a strategy proposal called the “world’s biggest social media team”, ironically represented by just two Tourism Australia employees at the time. What would happen, he asked, if we leveraged the 7.8 million visitors to Australia each year, the 300,000 people who work in the tourism industry, and the 26 million people who live there? Might they collectively generate positive buzz about the opportunities for visiting Australia? They did.
Jesse models core traits of aSystems Leader. He toggles between the balcony and the dance floor as he immerses himself in the day-to-day operations of Tourism Australia, takes a step back to see broader opportunities for change and identify what he must do to implement them, and then returns to the dance floor with actionable proposals and action plans for change. He leaves theContextual Systemto look at theEnvironmental System-- in this case the evolving tourism industry and a wide range of emerging technology and communication practices -- and questions fundamental assumptions like advertising having to be designed by advertising agencies. He then returns to theContextual System-- the dance floor at Tourism Australia -- to revise their processes and work closely with colleagues to implement UGC and social media as an alternative form of marketing.
Jesse’sSystems Leadercapabilities of toggling between dance floor and balcony and betweenEnvironmentalandContextual Systemsradically changed tourism advertising, particularly for national tourism boards and organizations, not only in Australia but globally.
The next entry in the series will explore Selfmaking as a complement of the Sensemaking examined here and as a crucial way of understanding the ongoing learning, growth, and work of the Systems Leader.
