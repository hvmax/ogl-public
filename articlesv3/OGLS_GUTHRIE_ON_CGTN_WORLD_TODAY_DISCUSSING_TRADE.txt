### OGL'S GUTHRIE ON CGTN WORLD TODAY DISCUSSING TRADE

5 July 2024|China, Trade
AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy and, in particular, life in China. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. In this post, OGL'S Doug Guthrie participates on a panel interviewed by CGTN World Today’s Liu Kun about the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO),a Eurasian political, economic and security organization established by China and Russia in 2001. This session addresses the 2024 SCO Meeting, which took place in Kazakhstan on July 4. Guthrie’s live interview comments are included here. Listenhere.
Over the last couple of years, I've had a number of CGTN interviews and it seems to exemplify the best in explanatory journalism: deep conversations on critical topics in a timely manner. Unpacking these important topics for the audience requires careful, nuanced thought.
In this interview, I shared the stage withDr. He Wenping, Professor and Senior Research Fellow of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, andDr. Mher Sahakyan, Director of the China-Eurasia Council for Political and Strategic Research. We were interviewed by Kun Liu of CGTN, who has welcomed me onto the CGTN World Today’s stage a number of times.
In preparation for this panel discussion postedhere, panelists received nine questions that were, again, both deep and subtle. During the interview, Kun Liu methodically marched us through these questions, building the conversation to achieve a dialogue that would leave listeners with significantly more knowledge than they had at the beginning of the show.
A list of the pre-program questions is attached below. I include this list to highlight an issue: We typically think that democratic societies will always yield a more open, freer flow of information, and thus better news. In areas subject to censorship and control of ideas, this is probably true. However, we should also note that a rapid-fire, free-flowing exchange of ideas often does not yield a better product or leave the audience any smarter.
I would like to commend China’s CGTN World Today for its commitment to insightful panel discussions that both explain, educate and illuminate the news. –Doug Guthrie
Overall, how do you comment on the significance of this SCO summit in Kazakhstan? What’s its role in the development of SCO as a regional organization?This year’s meeting adopted the Astana Declaration, together with a series of other documents on forging friendly neighbors and partners, on investment and so on. In your observation, which one/ones of these documents matter the most and why?In his speech at the 24th Meeting of the Council of Heads of State of the SCO, Chinese President Xi Jinping called on participating countries to fend off Cold War mentality and “small yard, high fences” risks, and to oppose external interference into regional affairs. He also called on all sides to adhere to the Shanghai Spirit. How do you understand the background of his remarks?What does the addition of Belarus as a full member of SCO mean for both Belarus and SCO? How does the addition benefit both sides?The SCO was born primarily for security reasons. Its predecessor, the "Shanghai Five," was formed to manage border security issues after the end of the Cold War. Does this remain the mission of the SCO today? What new responsibilities is the organization taking up or should take up?Some western analysts commented that the SCO is a place for conversation rather than a platform where collective decisions are made, implemented and have an impact. What’s your take?Other western critics said the SCO is merely a bloc through which China intends to project its influence in the region. How do you respond to that?One of the areas the SCO focuses on is Central Asia. China also hosted the first China-Asia Summit last year in Xi’an. And during this trip to Central Asia, President Xi paid state visits to Kazakhstan and Tajikistan. Strategically and economically, is Central Asia increasingly important for China? Why or why not? In forging closer ties with China, what do Central Asian countries want?The China-Kyrgyzstan-Uzbekistan railway project has been agreed and signed off by the three countries in late June. Why is the railway worth investing on for these three nations respectively?
