AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy and, in particular, life in China. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. We have sought to advance a conversation about what the U.S.-China relationship, including through translations of key China documents and scholars. This is one of our ongoing translations of Chinese scholarship and leaders to further illuminate the state of play today. -- The OGL Team

To further consider the White House’s U.S. Strategic Approach to the People’s Republic of China on May 20, 2020, the Center for International Security the Strategy (CISS) of Tsinghua University, a Beijing international policy think tank, held a discussion on June 10 on the topic of China’s options for responding to the U.S. policy adjustment toward China. We share some translated excerpts from attendees:
The United States is trying to drive the dispute with China over institutions and values
Fu Ying, 傅莹 (Director of CISS, Tsinghua University, former vice minister of foreign affairs)
The "Strategic Approach to PRC" and the series of recent speeches by American politicians such as [U.S. Secretary of State Michael] Pompeo pointed the finger at Chinese governance and the ruling party, listed the "value challenge" as one of the China's three major challenges to the United States, and highlighted the political ideological roots of China's domestic and foreign policies. It meant to deliberately paint China as the Soviet Union of the earlier years. The intention is nothing more than to push political and security agendas into the priority of the U.S.-China competition, and to provide a basis for coercing companies and the businesses to accept "decoupling". The reason is that the U.S. hard-line forces want to tighten their strategic competition with China, and not let the need for cooperation in the fight against the pandemic to ease the competition, thereby distracting or even disrupting their "strategic deployment". They try to use the opportunity to enlarge the competition.
Before the COVID-19 pandemic, Western thought circles have begun to worry that China’s success as a non-Western democratic country will have the effect of diluting the appeal of Western values, which further confirms the failure of the United States and the West to dominate the world in terms of political systems and values ​​after the Cold War. The performance of China and the United States in the fight against COVID-19 is very different, and which does better is easy to judge. The outside world has to admit that the Chinese model is effective in maintaining the safety of people's lives and responding to public health crises. From the perspective of the U.S. strategic circles, China's rise is not only a challenge to the actual interests and international status of the United States, but also a threat to the stability and value output of the U.S. system. This is a challenge of deeper significance. From the Chinese perspective, the United States has never given up its attempt to subvert the socialist system under the leadership of the Communist Party of China. Now it is trying to separate the party and its leaders from the Chinese people, antagonize the party and the people, and provoke the legitimacy of the Chinese political system. China must resolutely fight against it.
Looking at today’s adjustments to U.S. policy towards China, we cannot underestimate the deliberate misunderstanding and misjudgment of China by some politicians with various self-interests, the harm it brings to the bilateral relationship, and even temporarily derail from the right track. But we don’t overestimate their ability to change historical trends. The success of historical figures depends on whether their thoughts and actions conform to the objective laws of historical development. The United States no longer possesses the kind of absolute strong position that influences international affairs and international relations like at the end of the Cold War, nor does it have sufficient reasons and necessary appeal to set off a global wave of comprehensive strategic containment and ideological hunting against China.
Safeguarding China's right to development is the theme of China's struggle against the United States
Zhang Baijia, 章百家 (academic committee member of CISS, former vice director of CPC Central Committee History Research Center)
In this competition or game that China and the United States have begun, what the United States wants to maintain is its global leadership, and what China wants to maintain is its own development rights. This is the core of the current Sino-U.S. contradiction. This only occurs when the comprehensive national strength of China reaches a certain level. However, objectively, the goals of China and the United States are not at the same magnitude. China does not have the will to replace the United States' global leadership, and in fact it does not possess such strength. This will leave room for China and the United States to avoid a zero-sum game, and both sides have some room for maneuvering in this struggle.
It is true that the existing international order and international governance system need to be improved, but this kind of reform can only be gradual and requires consultation and cooperation between countries. Although the current Sino-US relations are in a difficult situation, the two countries still have the opportunity to avoid embarking on the old path of great powers' struggle for hegemony. The premise is that the United States recognizes that the decline in its global influence is caused by both its own internal reasons and foreign policy errors, not because of China’s challenges; China recognizes that safeguarding its own right to development is the theme of this struggle toward the United States.
Political miscalculation reflects the illusion of changing China's system
Wang Jisi, 王缉思 (director of IISS Peking University, academic committee member of CISS)
In his China policy speech on June 24, the U.S. President's National Security Advisor Robert O'Brien recalled the U.S. attitude toward China in the past few decades and accused the past U.S. administrations of making "misjudgments" of China. It is thought that opening the U.S. market to China would lead China to "political liberalization". This is one representative viewpoint among the Americans who observe and handle relations with China. Another representative view is that the past economic cooperation with China has caused the United States to “suffer a big loss” and China to take “a big advantage”—this is an important ideological basis for the Trump administration’s trade war against China and pursuing the economic and technology "decoupling". These two viewpoints echo each other and have the same effect. They both say that the U.S. policy of contact and cooperation with China in the past is “the wrong way”, and that the U.S. should put pressure on China across the board.
As for the so-called “misjudgment” of China by the United States in the political field, it actually only reflects the illusions of some American observers. The political mainstream in China has always adhered to the leadership of the Communist Party and the socialist system, and has never wavered or given Americans illusions. The U.S. political mainstream and the mainstream of public opinion know this well, so they continue to attack rather than affirm China’s political system and values. The United States’ past “dual-handed” policy has always been conducive to safeguarding the long-term interests of the U.S., but the current total suppression strategy is short-sighted and detrimental to the long-term interests of the United States.
The U.S. policy toward China has shifted from carrot and stick to full-scale pressure, not only because of the structural reasons that China is getting closer in strength, but also because the United States has increasing negative views on China politics, plus facing the political polarization and social conflicts back home in the United States, and the intensification of ethnic conflicts. The Trump administration has continued to "pass the buck" to China, attempting to achieve domestic political goals by attacking the predecessor’s China policy. We should keep a clear understanding of this.
It is unreasonable to accuse China of being aggressive
Yao Yunzhu, 姚云竹 (academic committee member of CISS, former director of Military Science Research Institute U.S. Defense Research Center)
As the world's second-largest economy, China has extensive overseas interests. China mainly protects these interests through multilateral cooperation and the maintenance of the existing international order. China's small overseas military presence is not only to fulfill international responsibilities (such as escort in the Gulf of Aden), to carry out defense cooperation (such as joint exercises, exchange visits of ships), but also to better protect the safety of Chinese overseas nationals and assets in times of crisis (such as carrying out the task of evacuation of overseas nationals). This is very different from how the United States deploys its forces globally, establishes a network of overseas bases, organizes military alliances, and launches wars at every turn.
China's geostrategic environment is complex and severe. Through peaceful negotiations, the land delimitation with 12 neighboring countries has been resolved, and efforts are being made to resolve or control maritime territorial rights disputes with neighboring countries through peaceful means. And it is precisely because the United States has carried out high-intensity naval and air reconnaissance against China and "free navigation operations" violated China’s sovereignty that the two countries have frequent encounters between ships and aircraft. Just look at the places where the dangerous events happen—all in China, not in the waters around the United States, or even in the vast ocean—to understand whether China or the United States is making aggressive provocations!
The White House's accusations against China are fallacious and unprofessional
Da Wei 达巍 (CISS visiting researcher, School of International Relation professor)
The U.S. government wants to criticize China and adjust its strategy toward China. That is its freedom. However, this document is full of fallacies and is very unprofessional. Even if the U.S. wants to criticize China, it should be more accurate and professional. Here are some examples.
First, the "Strategic Approach" claimed that the U.S.'s past China strategy was based on expectations of changes in China's political system. However, many long-term researchers and practitioners of Sino-U.S. relations in the United States believe that the U.S. did not have such expectations in the past. Obviously, there is at least no unified opinion in U.S. strategic circles.
Second, the "Strategic Approach" says that China has not fulfilled its WTO [World Trade Organization] commitments. Here is a quote from Pascal Lamy, the former Director-General of the WTO and the EU negotiator when China entered the WTO. Lamy stated in 2011 that China's achievements in fulfilling its WTO commitments can get an “A+”. In 2018, in the context of the Sino-U.S. trade war, Lamy criticized China for not opening up enough in government procurement and other areas, but once again said China did not deceive. The United States was wrong on this point. China complied with what she committed to WTO in the past.
The "Strategic Approach" claims that China is spreading anti-Western ideologies abroad. The author seems to observe the Communist Party of China from the perspective of the Soviet Communist Party. China does attach importance to overseas communication, but its purpose is to increase countries' understanding of China and improve China's image. What systemic content does the CPC’s global ideology include? Which country in the world has fully copied China's political and economic system under China's propaganda?
The "Strategic Approach" claims that Chinese high-tech companies such as Huawei pose a threat to U.S. national security. What is puzzling is that if Huawei is so dangerous, why has the US government been unable to produce concrete evidence to prove that when, where, and how did Huawei endanger US security? Where is the "smoking gun"?
When it discusses the principles of dealing with China, the “Strategic Approach” referred to words: “freedom,” “openness,” and “rule-based”. These are actually the core principles of the “liberal international order”. In the last a few years, the most disruption to this order has been the Trump administration, which has continued to “withdraw” to “build walls”, ending with “decoupling”, and to "weaponize" the interdependence of the nations.
The US strategy towards China highlights the dualistic thinking of friend or foe
An Gang 安刚 (CISS visiting researcher,World Affairseditor)
The White House's "Strategic Approach to PRC" declared that future China strategies will be guided by "principled realism" and "result-oriented" as the standard. Looking back at the realist tradition in the U.S. foreign strategy, the most influential is the realist thinking of "peace through strength" during the Reagan era, that is, "Reaganism". The United States vigorously expanded its armaments, expanded nuclear deterrence, and lured the Soviet Union into the trap of an arms race. In the face of challenges such as the revival of Russia and the rise of China, some people in the U.S. strategic circles have actively advocated "offensive realism." The basic judgment is that the "anarchy" of the international system is doomed to the tragic fate of great power competition. This thinking and actions are guarding against opponents, protecting power, and defending hegemony. This is regarded as the norm by the right-wing forces that currently control Washington’s politics. "Principled realism" is a mixture of "Reaganism" and "offensive realism."
For realists, the essence of international relations is the struggle among countries for power. The country can only achieve power change through competitions. The pursuit of power without exception leads to conflicts and wars from a historical perspective. But history cannot be simply copied, with the development of the global system, international order, the evolution of the technology, the degree of interdependence among countries are constantly deepening. The structural relationships between political actors are deeply intertwined and extremely complex and it is impossible to use a simple friend or foe binary. In today's world, the simpler and easier way is for major powers to maintain restraint and prudence, and achieve peace and reasonable redistribution of power through peaceful coexistence, cooperative governance, and mutual benefit. It is sad that a major power would adopt such foreign strategy and practice with absolute guidance of realism, and it is even more dangerous to be controlled by radicals. So calling for multilateralism, international tolerance, and diplomacy to return is extremely necessary.
There is no basis for this so-called U.S. "suffered" and "victimized" theory
Bian Yongzu 卞永祖 (CISS visiting researcher)
In the part of the "economical challenges", White House accused China of infringing on U.S. interests through unfair trade, theft of intellectual property rights, etc., which actually further elevated the U.S.’s "suffering" to "victimization". It has largely distorted the essence of Sino-U.S. economic relations.
The close economic tie between China and the United States is the result of globalization. The economic structure and division of labor between the two countries determined that they are each other’s important trading partners. Technical cooperation between enterprises is also based on the consideration of maximizing their interests. It is an active and spontaneous market behavior. In 2019, the number of international patent applications from Chinese companies ranked first in the world. Therefore, strengthening the protection of intellectual property rights and building a fair and competitive market environment for businesses with different ownerships are also China's needs.
This close economic relationship is beneficial to China. The United States has obtained extensive markets and enormous economic benefits from it. American companies have made huge profits by investing in the Chinese market and achieved their advantages at the top of the global industrial chain. China’s supply of goods gave American consumers better choices and their cost of living greatly reduced. At the same time, the United States also maintains a huge surplus of areas such as agricultural products, tourism, transportation, education, and intellectual property from China. But the White House slandered the Chinese government for violating the principle of fairness that is causing the U.S. trade deficit. There is no basis for this so-called U.S. "suffering theory" and "victimized theory".
