### Entrepreneurship in China Today: A Bookseller and a Basketmaker

23 January 2020|China
This is the first in a series of 3 (or 4) posts from our team. Through these posts we aspire to give a flavor of what entrepreneurship looks and feels like in China today.
1.  We often think of China as the one-party authoritarian system that embraces the mantles of socialism and communism. However, the fact is that China is among the most entrepreneurial economies in the world. This is one of the interesting economic paradoxes of our time: How did it come to be that the largest “Communist” polity in the world has become the most entrepreneurial society and economy in the world?
2.  Entrepreneurialism in China is huge, especially in the “micro-entrepreneurship” sector. Household entrepreneurs employ more people than the entire US labor force (140MM vs 128MM); if you add small-scale entrepreneurs, the size of the total micro-economy labor force is about the size of the entire US population.
3.  Understanding the evolution of this sector of the Chinese economy requires an understanding of Chinese history, culture, and the political moves the current administration is making. And while China is not a democracy and we generally think of China as a state-run economy (or at least an economy in which the state has a significant amount of influence and control), there is a tremendous amount of freedom and encouragement around the entrepreneurial culture in China today.
"Capitalism on Steroids"
I have been studying China’s economy for a long time, so I am not as surprised by what is occurring there as some people might be. Occasionally, I get the opportunity to introduce someone to this world and see it through their eyes. Several years ago, as I was moving my family over to China (for the beginning of a 5-year stint with Apple in China), I had one of those moments. After a few weeks of settling in to our service apartment in Shanghai, my wife, who had just been down to visit the International Finance Center mall underneath our apartment building, said to me: “I know that China has been in the process of a transition from communism to capitalism, but I wasn't expectingthis…This is capitalism on steroids.”
Let’s look at a couple of cases that might help us see into this Communist world that is actually “capitalism on steroids.”
A Nine-Year-Old Entrepreneur Builds a Construction Empire, Opens Bookstores, and Explores Blockchains
Sometime in December (2019), I took a trip to Chengdu with the CEO of Microsoft’s Shanghai accelerator, James Chou. James is a good friend, and occasionally I give talks to the entrepreneurs and startups he works with and supports in his role. I enjoy working with James, because, in addition to him being a great person and a great leader, I always meet interesting entrepreneurs working at the cutting edge of economic development in China.
In this case, James had asked if I would accompany him to Chengdu to give a talk to a group of young entrepreneurs in this important Southwest Chinese City. This group of entrepreneurs was a book group, and I was asked to assign them readings, so I asked that they read Scott Galloway’sThe Fourand Eric Reis’The Startup Way.
I gave the talk in a beautiful Chengdu bookstore called Subset. It is a gorgeous space, and the owner has clearly tried to build something more than just a place to buy books; it is a space to build community. We didn’t end up talking that much about the assigned books, but we had a spirited discussion about entrepreneurship in today’s China and the differences in entrepreneurship between China and the US. The dialogue did not disappoint, and I continue to believe that this “communist” society is the most entrepreneurial place in the world. (Question: How is it that the largest “communist” society in the world is the most dynamic entrepreneurial market in the world as well? The dynamic occurring in China today might well challenge Alexis de Tocqueville’s famous treatise on Democracy in America and the idea that true entrepreneurship can only occur under a democratic regime that accentuates individualism.)
Back to Key Insights
First, a little family history here (i.e., family of the bookstore owner): Over spicy hotpot (a Sichuan specialty), I asked the family patriarch, Mr. Liu, when and why he decided to open the bookstore. He very quickly noted that the bookstore is not his venture – his 24-year-old son, Liu Jiuchen (who invited me to give the talk in the first place), is the owner, proprietor, and visionary for the entire endeavor. “You should ask him,” Mr. Liu said, pointing to the young Mr. Liu seated to my right. “I had nothing to do with it.” It was a little odd talking to a 24-year-old about his entrepreneurial vision for building a multimillion-dollar bookstore/community center in the heart of Chengdu. But he was a convincing and thoughtful spokesperson/CEO.
But how did this come to be? The elder Mr. Liu started his career as an entrepreneur at the tender age of 9 years old. Born in 1971, Mr. Liu turned 9 as Deng Xiaoping was taking power and announcing a number of structural changes that would transform China, all part of the “Economic Opening” (jingji kaifang, 经济开放) movement that would be the signature of Deng’s economic reforms. Mr. Liu did not attend middle school, high school, or college; at the age of 9 he was focused on selling things – he was focused on entrepreneurialism in its most basic form; first vegetables that he bought in the countryside around Chengdu and carted back into the city to sell; then pork. Eventually, having saved enough money from selling vegetables and pork, at the age of 23, Mr. Liu decided to build a construction company, which then led him to the field of real estate development. Suffice it to say, his entrepreneurial endeavors have been wildly successful. Over the course of the evening, it was fascinating to hear Mr. Liu opine on his forays into the fields of Internet platforms for construction and real estate and blockchains (more on this below). As an aside, many of China’s emerging wealthy elite have climbed a similar ladder – small-scale entrepreneurship, leading to bigger and better endeavors, leading to construction and real estate development, which is where a lot of the money is. In China’s period of investment led growth, the state has poured billions into the building of the country and many small-time real estate developers have ridden these coattails.
Second, a little data… Just how entrepreneurialisChina? Micro-entrepreneurship is rampant in China right now and just might be one of the key engines of economic development there. In the early years of the reform era (i.e. the 1980s), when the state employment system was still in place[1], the legalization of entrepreneurship simply allowed households to find a way to make a living. Decollectivization allowed peasant households to sell vegetables at market, and entrepreneurial individuals like Mr. Liu opened little shops along crowded urban blocks, often selling perishable goods – vegetables, water, beer, Coca-Cola, snacks, even pork. Over the years, the harder-line faction of the Chinese government, which opposed the idea of too many people “descending into the sea of capitalism” (xiahai, 下海), became more comfortable with the idea of private entrepreneurs pursuing their own interests, and the system expanded.
Today, there are about 60 million private household businesses (getihu, 个体户), employing some 140 million individuals and operating stores in cities across China. If you add to this the number of “micro enterprises” (xiaowei qiye, 小微企业) – a separate but related category of businesses that can employ more people than private household businesses – the number comes to about 70 million small-scale enterprises employing about 300 million Chinese citizens.[2] And this figure is actually an underestimate of the number of people working in China’s private micro-economy, as it doesn’t include individuals who have not registered as household businesses.
In other words, the population working in China’s micro-economy is more than double the entire U.S. labor force and nearly equal to the entire U.S. population. One might argue that this is not surprising, given that China is about four times as populous as the United States. But this is not a proportional question; it is an absolute one – the question is: how entrepreneurial is China? And if the question is how much entrepreneurism is there in China today, the household and micro-enterprises are only the tip of the iceberg – the larger and higher-valued private enterprises are now becoming a global force in their own right. Mr. Liu started out as an unregistered household enterprise selling vegetables from the countryside; today, he runs a real estate company that has played a major hand in the building of the infrastructure in and around Chengdu. And his son is opening book stores that are building community in the city. The dynamics are fascinating.
Third, a note on the building of a consumption-based economy… As mentioned above, Mr. Liu spent a lot of time over dinner talking about his forays into Internet platforms and blockchains. This was fascinating, if only because I was listening to someone who started out selling vegetables from the countryside talk about the promise of cutting-edge technology. But the more interesting dynamic here was one that I have heard from a number of successful real estate developers I know: they have all gotten the memo from the central government about the importance of investment-led growth to consumption-led growth.
I like to think about China’s reform-era in three phases: (1) export-led growth, where China deployed a lot of cheap labor to become the manufacturer for the world; (2) investment-led growth, where the country build a lot of stuff and employed a lot of people in doing so; and (3) now the transition to consumption-led growth, where the country is building a consumption based economy.
Indeed, as Li Keqiang said at Davos in 2015, “To foster a new engine of growth, we will encourage massentrepreneurshipandinnovation. China has 1.3 billion people, a 900-million workforce, and over 70 million enterprises and self-employed businesses. Our people are hard-working and talented. If we could activate every cell in society, the economy of China as a whole will brim with more vigor and gather stronger power for growth. Massentrepreneurshipandinnovation, in our eyes, is a ‘gold mine’ that provides constant source of creativity and wealth.” In other words, in order to spur on innovation, China needs to continue to develop an entrepreneurial society.
So, if you think about Mr. Liu’s career, he has moved from small-scale, household entrepreneurship, to large-scale investment in infrastructure, now to investment in consumption (a bookstore and community building and Internet platforms for the real estate business). Listening to the life of Mr. Liu, it is fascinating to hear the insights of someone who has been through this trajectory.
Another Example From the Other End of the Spectrum: A Small Town Basket Maker Goes Global
With a surprisingly muscular and lithe physique for a 75-year-old, “Grandpa Tu” (tulaoye, 钍老爷), as he is affectionately called in his city, rises every day at dawn and visits the forest behind his home in Shehong, which is in the heart of Sichuan Province.[3] As the sun rises, our research and film team follow Grandpa Tu as he searches for the right bamboo trees for the day’s work. Using a butcher knife from his kitchen, he chops down two trees with an ease borne of a lifetime handling bamboo. Cigarette dangling from his mouth, with a thick Sichuan accent, he speaks matter-of-factly as he hacks away at the branches and knots of the resilient stalks.
“Every day I make two baskets, including cutting the bamboo. No one taught me how to do this. Do I even need a teacher for this? I used to be a butcher, and no one taught me that either. Two baskets a day, and then I have to sell them. This is how I make my living,” says Grandpa Tu, whose 20-gallon baskets are woven from green bamboo. Shaped like large vats, his baskets might be used for laundry or storage. Grandpa Tu cuts and strips the bamboo with a graceful ferocity, an act he’s done every day for more than 22 years. Then, almost to himself, he starts to narrate again: “Start from the bottom [as he begins weaving the first of his two baskets], two baskets a day. I am diligent and I want to make money. But I also have to like doing it.”
Grandpa Tu does not have a store, and he doesn’t take his baskets to fairs or festivals to trade; he does not even ever leave Shehong. So how does he make money? How do his baskets reach paying customers, some of them as far away as Beijing? Like many local artisans in China, Grandpa Tu relies on an ambitious middleman down the road with access to larger markets. Enter Ren Zuguo, 53, who distributes the hand-made products of local artisans like Grandpa Tu. Ren is the owner of a small family-owned business that sells anything you can make from bamboo – baskets, chairs, floor mats, baby bassinets, dumpling steamers. The Shehong area is rich in bamboo and, over the years, has become known for its bamboo wares. The Ren Family never makes the products; their business is an aggregator of sorts for local artisans. Ren speaks proudly about his independence and success: “I have always run my own household business. We started this business in 1996. It has been growing slowly over the last 22 years, getting a little better every year.”
Sometime in 2015, the Ren Family business took off. At that time, Ren Zugou’s son, Ren Dong, 28, returned home from Chengdu, one of the largest cities in western China, to join the family business. When he was in his early 20s, Ren Dong had headed off to the big city to make his fortune, however, like many young people in China today, he decided that opportunities might be better in his smaller hometown. So, he returned home to work with his father. He introduced his father to the Internet and to the online marketplace, and the Ren Family joined the ranks of storeowners selling their wares on Alibaba’s e-commerce marketplace, Taobao. Ren’s products now sit among the billion-plus products listed on Taobao. His is one of the 400 million Taobao online retail stores. A decade ago, it would have been inconceivable for an elderly basket maker (like Grandpa Tu) to sell his products 3,000 miles away in Beijing. Today, it is a fairly seamless process. In 2017, the Ren Family business netted about RMB 3 million (about $600,000). In a country where the per capita GDP hovers around $8,000, that is pretty impressive.[4]
Grandpa Tu and the Ren Family exemplify the kind of raw entrepreneurial spirit that has taken hold in China, where entrepreneurs industriously find a way to use the resources available to them to make a better life. In conversations with both Grandpa Tu and Mr. Ren, you can hear the pride in the sense of entrepreneurial independence in making a living for themselves. However, that their story also marries a product that has been made the same way for millennia with 21stcentury marketing and sales technology is telling. This is the reality of entrepreneurialism in China today: intensely local, family-based, and determined to reach beyond the boundary of its own neighborhood, city, and province.
So, China’s brand of entrepreneurship has a human face, and it is growing at a hyper-industrial pace and scale. In the West, we know the names Tencent, Alibaba, and Huawei, and these organizations are critical in China today, yet the secret of China’s economic success is also rooted in the armies of small-scale family businesses that fan out across China and use technology to touch the world. It is this kind of dissonance that symbolizes China’s economic ascendance over the last four decades. One of the greatest ironies of our time is that the largest Communist society in the world quietly became the world’s most vibrant entrepreneurial and capitalist economy.
Many observers think China’s rise from an isolated, developing nation – with 800 million people living in abject poverty in 1979 – to the second largest economy in the world in 2019 came as a result of protectionism, state control, and a deep, cheap labor pool. Indeed, these elements are all part of the story but there are more significant and surprising variables: (1) the country’s vibrant entrepreneurial culture, which extends from household entrepreneurs to scrappy startups to national behemoths and even entrepreneurial local governments; and (2) China’s hybrid model of innovation, which relies heavily on a close state-market alliance. The growing alliance between the government and the private sector has been crucial for the evolution of China’s economy. And, over these four decades, the Chinese Government has intelligently and gradually rebuilt the entrepreneurial culture that existed in Chinese society for 2,000 years. This “rebuilding” process has included allowing and supporting small-scale entrepreneurship; learning from powerful players in the global marketplace; the exhortation to build on that learning, scaling, refining; and, ultimately, innovating. It has also included protectionism that shielded the growing new private sector from more powerful foreign brands. And, finally, it has included a close alliance between the emerging national powerhouses such as Alibaba and Huawei and the government to jointly build a consumption-based economy.
The Liu Family and Tu/Ren Family stories yield both fascinating lessons about entrepreneurship in China today. Economic development and entrepreneurship in China are wild and twisting roads. And while China is not a democracy and we generally think of China as a state-run economy (or at least an economy in which the state has a significant amount of influence and control), there is a tremendous amount of freedom and encouragement around the entrepreneurial culture in China today. As Deng Xiaoping used to say: economic development is like “feeling for stones to cross the river…” That’s what entrepreneurship feels like in China today.
[1] The state employment system was a system in which the “work unit” (danwei, 单位) was the backbone of the social security system. Upon graduating from high school or college, people were simply assigned to a state-owned enterprise (SOE) in urban areas or a township and village enterprise (TVE) in rural areas. As of 1979, when the economic reforms began, private entrepreneurship did not exist in Communist China.
[2] The term micro-enterprise (xiaowei qiye, 小微企业) is, technically a (relatively) new category in China as of 2008. In 1980, three new private capitalist categories were introduced into the Chinese system, individual household business (getihu,个体户), individual industrial business (gongshanghu, 工商户), and private enterprise (siying qiye, 私营企业). In 2008, the term micro-enterprise would replace the term individual industrial business. For the sake of simplicity, I use the more recent term for both categories.
[3] Chinese cities are divided into Tiers 1-6, based on a set of criteria including population, GDP, GDP per capita and “political sophistication”. While Shehong is considered a “small” lower-tier city (tier 5), it still has a population of over 1 million.
[4] In a Tier 5 City like Shehong, the per capita income is much lower than $8,000. Statistics are difficult to find in places like Shehong, but estimates are that per capita income in Shehong is closer to $3,000.
