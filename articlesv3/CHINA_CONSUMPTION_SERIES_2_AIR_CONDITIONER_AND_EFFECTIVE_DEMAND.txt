### CHINA CONSUMPTION SERIES 2: AIR CONDITIONER AND EFFECTIVE DEMAND

AtOn Global Leadership, we have developed a deep analysis of the Chinese economy and the Chinese economic transformation over the last 45 years. We have written about China’s innovative approach to building the most dynamic manufacturing supply chain in the world and China’s approach to building the world’s most dynamic capitalist economy. We have advanced this through our work on China’ssecond- andthird-tier city development of innovative,entrepreneurial citiesandlocal industrial clusters. We have also used the field of NewEconomy Sociology(with leaders likeNeil Fligstein,Walter Powell, andHarrison White) and theNew Structural Economics(Justin Lin,林毅夫). In this post, we follow up on a meeting with one of the world’s leading economists, Professor Justin Lin. In that meeting, Professor Lin asked OGL to lay out our analysis of what was happening in China’s Consumption Economy development. This article is the second in a series of OGL analyses on this topic. To dive into this topic, we look deeply into specific issues of the consumption economy, in this case the use of air conditioning.

Consumption has become a central driver of China's economy. However, insufficient effective domestic demand continues to pose a significant constraint. What supply- and demand-side factors contribute to this phenomenon? In ourprevious article, we examined living standards in China through the lens of air conditioning (AC) ownership. This article continues to explore this household essential. By analyzing demand-supply dynamics, we aim to go beyond statistical data to offer readers a more nuanced understanding of how understanding of how Chinese consumption is evolving during economic transformation.
Effective Demand
Effective demand is a key economic indicator used to assess the healthy functioning of an economy, with its foundational definition rooted in Keynesian theory. Although Chinese government documents do not offer a direct definition, effective demand can be described as "the aggregate social demand in the economy that is supported by both the willingness to purchase and the ability to pay within a certain period of time". Insufficient effective demand refers specifically to a lack of demand that is financially viable, resulting in an imbalance between aggregate supply and demand.
Keynesian economics emphasizes short-term demand management as its central theoretical framework, advocating the use of fiscal and monetary policies to regulate aggregate demand and reduce economic fluctuations. However, the insufficient effective demand in China's economy displays a persistent nature, even in some strong growth periods. This contradiction calls for moving beyond isolated concept of demand or supply-side analyses and instead adopting a dual perspective that incorporates both sides of the market.
Accordingly, we choose the air conditioning industry as a case study, as it reflects typical supply-side structural problems and demand-side dynamics driven by consumption upgrading. While single-industry studies belong to the microeconomic level and differ methodologically from the macroeconomic topics like insufficient effective demand, such analyses can still provide valuable insights. Industry-level data and observations can reveal multiple interpretations of macroeconomic trends, helping to uncover their underlying mechanisms.
China's Air Conditioner Demand and Supply
China is the world's largest air conditioner market and manufacturing hub. Air conditioners are classified as major home appliances among durable consumer goods. According to 2023 data from China's National Bureau of Statistics, which reported ownership of 145 units per 100 households (171.7 in urban areas and 105.7 in rural areas), the total installed base of residential air conditioners in China exceeds 500 million units (1).
China's air conditioner market has reached a mature stage, primarily driven by replacement demand consumption upgrading. Over half of sales now come from replacements. As consumers grow increasingly rational and prioritize product quality, demand is gradually shifting toward enhanced comfort, health benefits, and sustainability. Notably, despite steep price cuts from intense competition, most consumers prefer advanced-feature models at the same price point, rather than just lower prices. Chinese-manufactured air conditioners have steadily gained market share globally, supported by consistently stable export prices in recent years.
Amid intense competition from Chinese brands, international AC brands show clear market polarization. Daikin and Hitachi maintain strong positions in the high-end market through localized operations and technological expertise, capturing around 50% of high-end decoration projects (2). In contrast, Fujitsu experienced a 27% drop in sales in Greater China in fiscal 2024 due to weak competitiveness (3).
On the supply side, China's domestic AC production capacity has significantly exceeded both domestic and global demand in recent years, leading to a general oversupply. The industry's average capacity utilization rate has stayed below 70% in most years, with significant regional differences. In this environment, leading companies like Midea, Gree, and Haier have used their first-mover advantages, supported by nationwide production networks and global operations. Facing competition from Xiaomi and AUX, which are quickly capturing submarkets with cost-effective strategies, these leaders are adopting a three-part strategy:
1. Launching budget sub-brands to engage in price competition and protect market share
2. Investing in high-end R&D to build unique competitive advantages
3. Expanding globally to reduce per-unit costs through economies of scale
After years of market consolidation, there are now fewer than 20 independent air conditioner manufacturers (domestic and foreign combined) operating in China. Over the next 3-5 years, under the triple pressure of policy, technology, and market factors, capacity rationalization will further accelerate (5).
China's AC market demonstrates the following key supply-demand characteristics:
1.Market saturation achieved: In demand-active regions, air conditioners have reached near-saturated household penetration, with purchase and usage costs remaining affordable for average residents.
2.Potential but not essential: While per-household ownership still has potential for growth relative to the number of rooms, additional purchases are non-essential for households already equipped with air conditioners, except under exceptional conditions such as extreme heatwaves.
3.Structural overcapacity as the central challenge: Overall production capacity significantly exceeds domestic demand, and intensifying global competition along with rising trade barriers complicates the absorption of surplus output. Although total domestic demand remains substantial and supply in some segments is tight, the industry as a whole faces a structural contradiction — insufficient effective demand coexisting with product surplus.
4.Market-led capacity adjustment: As a traditional manufacturing sector, AC receives limited policy support and resource allocation from local governments, making overcapacity more likely to be corrected through market-driven mechanisms.
5.Trade-in policies yield positive effects: These policies effectively stimulate consumer demand—especially for high-performance models—and help improve capacity utilization while mitigating supply-side volatility.
AC is not an isolated phenomenon in China's consumption landscape, but rather a representative case of most traditional industries. These sectors have largely satisfied basic consumer needs, yet still hold significant potential for consumption upgrades. They commonly face a mismatch between production capacity and effective demand, where structural imbalances coexist with relative overcapacity. Although policy measures such as trade-in programs can help stabilize short term demand fluctuations, market mechanisms remain the primary tools for addressing overcapacity.
Understanding these common characteristics is essential to grasping the nature of effective demand in China. Addressing this issue requires resolving structural constraints while fostering new growth drivers to achieve a balanced supply-demand relationship. The policy response from Beijing emphasizes more comprehensive demand-side management combined with targeted supply-side reforms. Further analysis will follow in subsequent articles.

1. Production and sales data for air conditioners from different sources use inconsistent units: "set" (套) or "unit" (台). In the industry, "one set" typically refers to one outdoor unit paired with one or more indoor units, such as in residential central AC systems. In China, a conversion of 1 set = 1.5 indoor units is commonly applied to installed base statistics.

5. The production capacity data refers to enterprises above designated size (those with a main business income of over 20 million yuan). In the table, Hunan Province's production capacity and capacity utilization rate are reported data, while its output is calculated data; for other provinces, their production capacity and output are reported data, and their capacity utilization rate is calculated data.
6. Chunlan(春兰) and Chigo(志高), once ranked among China's top three AC brands, have now completely exited the domestic mainstream market.
