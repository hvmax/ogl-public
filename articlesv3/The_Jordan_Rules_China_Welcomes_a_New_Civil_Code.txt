### The Jordan Rules: China Welcomes a New Civil Code

27 January 2021|China, Rule by Law
AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience, especially with respect to economic development and governance in China. This is the first of several posts in which we take on the complex issues surrounding China’s transforming legal system. – The OGL Editorial Team

On January 1, 2021, the new Civil Code of China took effect. The Civil Code takes up seven books and 1,260 articles, which include general principles, property rights, contracts, personal rights, marriage and family, inheritance, tort liability, etc. It not only covers the rules for how people's lives are conducted, but also carries the dream of a people yearning for a better and happier life and knowing their rights are protected.
Chinese philosophy has a long history of pondering the role of law in governing society. The role of law dates back to the Shen Buhai in the 4th Century BC and was taken up later by Han Fei in the 3rd Century, China’s Legalist School of Thought has a long and rich history. As we have discussedpreviously, over the course of 40 years of economic reforms, the Chinese Government has used the law to reinforce goals of building a strong economic system.
While the world often views one-party systems as antithetical to law, this view lacks nuance. There are important distinctions between the “RuleofLaw” system of governance, which is typical of Western Democracies, and the “RulebyLaw” system, found in China. RuleofLaw systems typically have independent judiciaries, and a rational process for adjudication of issues raised in the course. The Chinese RulebyLaw system is characterized by a close coordination between the legal system and the Party-State. There are important distinctions here, but it is inaccurate to say that China lacks a system of law. The era under President Xi has seen a dramatic reinvigoration of China’s focus on building a legal system, though one, again, that is closely coordinated with the Party-State system and its goals. (We will continue the discussion of this distinction in subsequent posts.)
The Jordan Rules[1]
On December 30, 2020, the Shanghai Second Intermediate People's Court issued a judgment in the naming-rights case of the American basketball superstar Michael Jordan versus Jordan Sports Company and Shanghai Bairen Trading Company. The verdict of the Intermediate Court ordered the Jordan Sports Company to terminate the use of "Jordan"1 in its business name. It was startling given the long history ofShanzhai(“mountain stronghold” or copycat) production in China. However, for those who have been watching the evolution of China’s Civil Code, which came into effect January 1, 2121, the ruling was actually not that surprising. Indeed, as article 1019 of the Civil Code clearly states, “it is forbidden to make, use or publish portraits of portrait right holders without the consent of the portrait right holders, except as otherwise provided by law.” The interesting question for China watchers was would the Chinese courts enforce the law even in the use of foreign images. Question answered on December 30, 2020: they did.

The Evolution of Law in the PRC
Seventy years ago, at the founding of the People’s Republic, the old legal system, which had evolved over the course of more than 2,000 years of Imperial rule, was abolished. In those early days of the new government, the focus of national political movements was to stabilize the social order, promote land reform, and consolidate the powers of the new regime. Efforts were made to draft a Civil Code in 1954 and again in 1962, but the plans were interrupted by different priorities. From 1949 until 1978, there was only one civil law, the Marriage Law.
After the economic reforms were launched in 1978, there was a sharp contrast between the destruction of the civil legislation and the strong demand of economic and social construction which required rules. The drafting of China's civil laws had been put on the agenda again. Meanwhile, in the years since, the central government has changed its thinking with regards to legislative procedure, advocating for a step-by-step process of enacting a new piece of civil legislation once each subject was ready, instead of waiting for the whole code to be completed. Since then, Chinese lawmakers have been producing new laws, including (but not limited to):
The Economic Contract Law (1982),The Trademark Law (1983),The Inheritance Law (1985),The General Rules of Civil Law (1987),The Contract Law (1999),The Property Law (2007),The Patent Law (2009),The Tort Liability Law (2010)
• The Economic Contract Law (1982),
• The Trademark Law (1983),
• The Inheritance Law (1985),
• The General Rules of Civil Law (1987),
• The Contract Law (1999),
• The Property Law (2007),
• The Patent Law (2009),
• The Tort Liability Law (2010)
Over time, the entire system of civil law has improved the sense that Chinese citizens have rights and responsibilities. The process has been gradual, but it has gradually fostered a sense that individual civil liberties are an important part of the economic reforms. The compilation and bringing together of these individual laws began five years ago, modeled after both the German and Taiwan Civil Codes. The group drafting the code worked to bring the code to the level that can serve today’s China economic and social development stage. The debates were sometimes heated and political within the draft group, and among legal scholars. The disagreement was focused on Personality Rights and Tort Liability. Some even warned the leeway could incite “color revolutions” as happened in Ukraine (Ukraine’s Civil Code, which went into effect 2003, included an independent chapter on Personal Rights.)
After more than five years of compilation and editing, the Civil Code of China was passed by a high vote at the third session of the 13th National People's Congress on May 28, 2020. The final version included the extensive articles on Personal Rights and Tort Liability. The articles stipulated in personal rights and protections are now being used to help define individuals’ data protections.

Rule by law is a distinctly Chinese approach to governance. When talking about China's democratic construction, more and more people believe a kind of development chronology about economic development, social progress and rule based democratic construction, that is, they advocate economic development first, then social construction, and finally rule by law governance. Only on the basis of economic and social development, can individual rights develop considerably in civil society and the public space, social justice properly maintained, and political democracy to be truly realized. Therefore, the construction of Chinese democratic structures is an iterative process rather than an overnight leap. China’s history, tradition, culture, the influence of external forces and the behavior of political leaders can promote or hinder the democratic process in a specific situation and time. However, the development of market economy, as a prerequisite for political democratization, has been confirmed by the practice of political development in many other countries.
The Chinese Government has a theory of the development of civil society, one that has been evolving over the last four decades of China’s Reform Era. The government is clearly interested in civil and social reform, as long as it fits together with the ecosystem that surrounds the Party’s legitimacy.
From the Chinese perspective, rule-based civil society helps to promote citizens' orderly political participation in a number of ways. First, civil society helps to improve citizens' political participation skills – they become more engaged in the global political issues of the day, but engaged in ways that support the government’sgradualpolitical evolution. Second, civil society provides various ways for citizens to express their interests, but, here again, these are tied to the gradual evolution the government would like to see. Third, civil society can become an important intermediary between government, markets, and citizens; and it can form positive interactions between State and society, which are indispensable for alleviating and coordinating interests and contradictions and encouraging citizens' political participation.
The legacy of Chinese traditional political culture, at times, has seemed to treat “the masses” as lacking the independent character of modern democratic participants. For a long time after the founding of the People's Republic of China, the leading Party’s practices of "movements” and participation mobilization have seemed to render the masses “politically indifferent”. At present, contradictions and problems in the field of China's sociological construction are becoming more and more prominent and apparent, and the task of promoting social management and its innovation is becoming more and more urgent.
Twenty years ago, China’s entrance into the World Trade Organization (WTO) forced a wave of reform and legislation in the first ten years of 21 century. Now, China faces new externalities and a seeming lack of drive for system and political reform. The China-EU Comprehensive Agreement on Investment (CAI) and China’s expressed interest to join CPTPP both require a higher threshold for labor practice, human rights, and governance standards. We would like to see this externality force into another wave of societal improvement and political reform.
The Jordan Rules, Part II
Coming back to the Jordan case, we noted that the defendant argued in the trials that “Jordan” is a common surname in the United States and UK. So Jordan, the basketball superstar, should not enjoy the right of a name exclusively in the legal sense in China. The defendant also claimed it had registered and used the "Jordan" trademark decades ago, long passed the statute of limitation, so the defendant could not constitute the infringement on the plaintiff.
The defendant’s remarks were nothing more than legal nuances and quibbles. As is the case globally, in China, people with even a little sports knowledge know that "Jordan" refers to Michael Jordan. Jordan Sports Company took the name as a business name and registered trademarks is an obvious “fox and tiger play”. No matter the common sense or from the legal point of view, it clearly infringes the plaintiff's right to his name.
The store front in Chinese says “Jordan Sports”

The real point of this case lies in the fact that such obvious common sense has been ignored by the relevant parties in China for a long time. The defendant not only openly borrowed the name of Jordan, but also successfully registered it. Since Michael Jordan filed the first lawsuit, the case has extended for nearly a decade, and the High Court of Beijing alone has made judgments on multiple occasions. In 2016, the Beijing High Court’s ruling: the "Jordan + graphics" on the clothing, shoes, hats, socks and other commodities of Jordan Sports Company were revoked. But the “Jordan Sports Company" remained untouched. It continued to advertise in the media with this name, a fact that puzzled many observers around the world.
Clearly, Michael Jordan himself was not satisfied with this, and continued to pursue the lawsuit. Finally, the Shanghai Second Intermediate People's Court ruled and ordered the defendant to publicly apologize to the plaintiff in newspapers and on the Internet, clarify “there is no relationship between the two Jordans”, and stop using the "Jordan" name in its company name and the trademarks, which then marked the finale. Hopefully, in the future, the Civil Code will help make cases like these easier.
Needless to say, there are still great distances to travel in the area of the Chinese Civil Code and the protection of individual civil liberties. But, brick by brick, article by article, progress is being made.

Note 1: The court case was over the usage of names “Qiaodan” and 乔丹, the “Jordan” sound in Chinese pinyin, and the customary Chinese translation for this name. But for reader’s convenience we used “Jordan” in the article as the term for all variations of the name in China and in Chinese.
