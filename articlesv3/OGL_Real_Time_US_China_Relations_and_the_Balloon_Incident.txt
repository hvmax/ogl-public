We hope these breaking news insights from our OGL team members will help illuminate the events of the day and provide the depth needed to understand global political, economic and cultural transitions and transformations. This Real Time Q&A seeks to further explore the views in China with respect to the current spy-balloon fiasco and U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken’s decision to cancel his scheduled visit to China this week.
Regarding the heightened tensions between the United States and China over the recent surveillance balloon situation, what are the sentiments in China with respect to U.S.-China relations right now?
The balloon incident occurred over the weekend during the Chinese Lantern Festival. Aside from adding one more talk point, the majority of Chinese netizens have not treated the incident as "a defining moment in the new Cold War" (1). The Chinese people have accepted the official explanation for the runaway civilian balloon, named it the Wandering Balloon after the name of a popular moviethe Wandering Earth II;some other people compare it to the full moon of the Lantern Festival (Figure 1).
The Chinese Government has referred to the balloon as a civilian airship used for meteorological and other research purposes and argued that the incident is entirely unexpected.
The Foreign Ministry's Mao Ning told journalists that the incident tests the Biden administration's sincerity about stabilizing and improving its relations with China and its approach to crisis management.
Some Chinese citizens are concerned that the severity of the balloon crisis has been greatly underestimated, the Wandering Balloon being a symbol of the runaway U.S.-China relationship. And that the U.S. choose to bring the balloon down rather than allow it to keep floating has extended this line of thinking. Some have more playfully put forward the idea that a U.S.-China Engagement Policy is “Gone with the Wind.”
Indeed, if both countries wanted to improve relations, the Wandering Balloon would not have been such sensational news. At present, many in China believe that the hostility toward China in America has further worsened because of the balloon crisis, and it will fall to new depths that may last for decades to come.
How are Chinese people feeling about the cancellation of U.S .Secretary of State Antony Blinken’s trip to China, which was scheduled to take place Feb. 5-6?
A Chinese balloon that, according to the Pentagon, "poses no threat to people on the ground," has become the reason for Secretary of State Antony Blinken's postponement of his visit to China. A widely held view in China is that this decision underscores the extremely low level of mutual trust between the United States and China.
According to public information, the incident has placed a pall over the U.S.-China relationship, though there is little to report here. On January 17, Kyodo News asked Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Wang Wenbin: ”According to US media, US Secretary of State Blinken will visit China. Could you give us more details?” He replied, "We welcome Secretary Blinken’s visit to China. China and the U.S. are in communication on the specifics of the visit..." On January 31, the tone was much colder, he glibly stated that that he had "nothing to share at the moment" when asked to comment on Blinken's China trip.
This was not a surprise because at the same press conference Mao commented on topics such as the U.S. administration has stopped approving licenses for American companies to export most items to China’s Huawei, including 4G smartphone chips, and the Netherlands will ban the sale of DUV machines to China (responding to pressure from the United States).
The Chinese public has speculated that the postponement of Blinken's visit to China mainly reflects the following reasons:
Succumbing to anti-China sentiment in U.S. domestic politics. Because the Biden administration's handling of China relations has been hijacked by extreme anti-China sentiment in Congress, and the harsh rivalry between the Democrats and Republicans over foreign policy, Biden has been careful in picking a path through the China minefield. In doing so, his policies have not been significantly different from those of Donald Trump.Leveraging the balloon incident as a convenient and timely excuse to postpone a meeting that likely would not have achieved any positive results. What the U.S. government did leading up to the planned Blinken trip has left the impression with China that the United States did not intend on building a friendly atmosphere to ensure Blinken's visit would be a success. Here the Chinese define success as how China can benefit from the relationship, not the United States.

As neither side intends to show softness to the other, Blinken's first visit to China promised to be extraordinarily difficult. Using diplomacy to ease tensions between the United States and China is a big challenge for both Washington and Beijing. For now, China should take the initiative to stabilize relations with the United States, make Blinken’s China trip happen, and the sooner the better.
In general, large, powerful nations gather information on each other regularly and in a variety of ways. Do Chinese people think that the Chinese government overstepped boundaries by allowing a surveillance balloon to encroach on American airspace?
For China, the Wandering Balloon incident is certainly not a good thing. Statements from the Foreign Ministry's Mao suggested that the weather balloon administrator (2) has not shared in a timely way the information of the out-of-control flight plans of the balloon, which crossed the U.S. and Canada. (A second China balloon wandered in airspace over Latin America and the Caribbean.)
The fact is that China's balloons were in the airspace of other countries, and how the United States chose to handle the situation in its own airspace is its own sovereign matter. While the vast majority of Chinese netizens wish China could have found a way to manipulate the balloons, they apparently do not believe that China currently has such a capability.
As China is struggling to boost its economy from three years of the COVID-19 pandemic, and expecting a new government in March, Beijing needs to maintain a stable external environment. Therefore, it is widely believed in China that Beijing has no intention to activate a balloon crisis.
Could the recent Chinese actions be tied to other political and military movements such as the recent announcement of the U.S. securing its access to military bases in the Philippines?
In theory, alliances can build deterrence and project the military power of allies, but history has also shown that such practices often facilitate rather than prevent conflicts. (e.g., NATO)
To many Chinese, after the October 2022 face-to-face meeting between Joe Biden and Xi Jinping in Bali, the relationship between China and the United States has basically not changed much.
The United States' return to the Philippines and opening bases is obviously aimed at containing China. U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin suggested the move may be part of a wider regional strategy in Asia but it also is a response to the concerns of the Philippines government about China's activities in the South China Sea. “These efforts are especially important as the People’s Republic of China continues to advance its illegitimate claims in the West Philippine Sea (South China Sea),” Austin said in Manila. Again, the U.S. presence is meant to signal the United States has a stake in the neighborhood.
Additionally, it is widely reported that four-star U.S. Air Force General Mike Minihan has predicted that a war with China is only two years away – so far the most direct and public prediction by a U.S. official about a potential U.S.-China military conflict, to date. In a January 2023 memo, Minihan, head of Air Mobility Command, said, "I hope I am wrong. My gut tells me we will fight in 2025." [3] Such exaggerated rhetoric is dangerous, irresponsible, and reflects the U.S. military's belief that a war between China and the United States is inevitable. Today, the risk of a great power military conflict is at the highest level since the Cold War.
The Chinese public is hoping that the United States will work to control the anti-China sentiment at home. Because a military conflict between China and the United States would be unbearable for everyone, the only way forward is for both sides to exercise restraint.
