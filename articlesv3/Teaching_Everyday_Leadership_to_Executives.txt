### Teaching Everyday Leadership to Executives

1 March 2022|Everyday Leadership, Leadership, Leadership Development
AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy. Several of us have advised companies and taught about leadership over theyears, and we have developed atheoryof leadership that takes us away from the charismatic leader to the person on the ground fighting for theteam, community,family, or evenyoung adolescent leaders. We have also written a significant amount aboutsystems leadershipandcreative leadership. In this post, we seek to continue our advancement of a view of Everyday Leadership and the teaching of leadership to executive teams. – The Editorial Team
As much as I love teaching about China, my favorite course to teach is Leadership. Recently, I was teaching Global Leadership for Thunderbird’s Executive Master of Arts in Global Affairs and Management (EMAGAM) program in Washington, D.C. It reminded me how much I enjoy teaching leadership at all levels – from undergraduates to master’s students to the executives who were part of EMAGAM.
It’s in these leadership sessions that I am often surprised or confronted by my students about my own life choices or even my shortcomings. Some months ago, I was teaching a leadership class over Zoom, and a student asked me to talk during a break. I hadn’t recognized him, but he had been an MBA student of mine at NYU-Stern more than a decade ago. He said, “Professor, please don’t take this the wrong way, but you seem like a more thoughtful person now. You seem moreintrospective.”
This got me – both devastating and exhilarating at the same time. What happened, as I explained to my student, was that I was fired. Back then, I was an arrogant young professor, more than a little bit full of myself. Today, I have been through some of the hard knocks that life and leadership can teach. In essence, the student was right: I am happy to say that I am more introspective and self-aware now than I was back then.
It’s a reality of the profession of academic leadership education: most of us have been raised in business schools, learning the literature and the art of teaching leadership, but few of us have actuallyledanything. That was me when I was 35. I was a hotshot young professor, with teaching experience at NYU, Columbia, Stanford, and Harvard. I knew how to teach leadership because I had learned from the best. But the thing is, I had neverbeena leader.
But then I got the call: I was recruited to be the dean of a business school at a very young age and with very little experience. Things went well for a while, and then the world blew up (I was fired after three years). So, what my student was experiencing was a different professor, someone who had flown close to the sun, had his wings melted away, and fell back to earth. And, ironically, it made me a better leadership professor.
Even as I grew up learning to teach leadership in the hallowed halls of academia, I always felt like something was wrong with how we teach leadership. We quietly stoke the fire of the arrogant, charismatic leaders of the next generation: you guys are awesome, you are the stars of your generation, we are going to teach you how to go in there and command a corporation. Since my earliest days of leadership teaching and mentorship, it always felt a little off to me. Then I was fired, and I realized not only was it off but I was one of those people.
Humility, Vulnerability, and Everyday Leadership
These days, I start every leadership class by having the students introduce themselves and then follow by introducing myself. This sequencing is important. When the students introduce themselves, it is usually very factual, unemotional, and structured around their work experiences and successes. I then tell them a little bit about my career, and tell them about one of the most painful things that happened to me in my career – when I was very publicly fired from a very big job – and how it changed me as a person and as a teacher and coach of leadership. I do this at the beginning of every class, as I want to set a tone that ties to vulnerability and humility. Modeling vulnerability and humility changes the culture of the class. And this is what good leadership is about – not just in the classroom but in all organizations: exposing yourself, connecting to people, and realizing you always have much to learn from everyone around you. And almost always at the first class break, at least one student will come to me and say, “I can’t believe you told us that story. Thank you.”
I then go into an exercise in which I ask students to think about the leader they admire the most in the world. Big names always come up – Barack Obama, Steve Jobs, Deng Xiaoping (if I am teaching in China), Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk, etc. I always close this exercise with one observation and one question. (1) “It’s interesting that you all named famous people at the peak of some mountaintop. I find it curious that no one named their Mom, their Dad, their high school volleyball coach.” I then talk about the leader who probably had the biggest impact on my life, my 11th grade high school English teacher, Joyce Calabrese. She was a leader, and she changed my life. (2) “When are you going to be a leader?” Participants will often say, “When I am promoted to be head of my division… When I become a Senior Director… When I become a VP.” My answer is always: “How about today? How about now?” Leadership is not about the position you are in, it is about how you influence the people around you to make the organization and the world a better place. Don’t wait for a promotion. I want you to walk out of this classroom, and choose to be a leader now, today.” Everyone, Every day, a Leader. Everyday Leadership.
Vision, Strategic Alignment, Motivation, and Introspection
When I was teaching this executive group, I was amazed by the dynamic interactive experience and the reception. It was a bit of a strange room. There were participants who were former ambassadors, there was the former Minister of Education in Afghanistan, and a number of other transitioning high-level government officials. And there was a group of mid-level rising leaders in the U.S. government and industry.
What did we talk about? We talked about leadership in the broadest sense. We talked about Vision, Strategic Alignment, Motivation, and Introspection. We talked about the fact that these leadership attributes and skills are not just the province of people in the C-suite; they are the domain and responsibility of every aspiring leader in the organization. I have to say, I have never had an executive class that engaged so deeply in the issues. It was truly amazing. Sometimes it is difficult getting students to talk and engage as much as you might like them to. This class, not so. The thoughtful engagement and deep thinking were truly remarkable. Although at least half of this room was quite senior, the interactive dialogue across the classroom and online (it was a hybrid class), was noteworthy.
When I teach leadership using the Vision-Alignment-Motivation-Introspection framework, I always emphasize four things that I think are underrepresented in leadership teaching: vulnerability, humility, alignment, and organizational culture. If you want to build an organization that rewards humility and vulnerability, you have to lead in building an “aligned” organizational culture that supports these behaviors.
As I listened to these leaders talk about humility and vulnerability in places like Afghanistan, the U.S. government, and corporate America, I was pleased to see the depth and thoughtfulness of these executives as they engaged with questions of leadership in the very real worlds they operate in. I have never been more proud or more thankful for the privilege of talking with a roomful of people about leadership.
Everyday Leadership. Everyone, Every day, a Leader.
