### A GLIMPSE INTO CHINA’S 2025: PRESIDENT XI’S NEW YEAR MESSAGE

3 January 2025|China history, China politics, Geopolitics
At On Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy and, in particular, life in China. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. In this post, we continue our work on the hidden strengths of China’s capitalist economy. In our view, China has struck a remarkable balance between building sophisticated industrial clusters while also gradually creating domestic consumption markets across a number of different sectors and products. Yet, there have been concerns over the last year. President Xi’s New Year’s Eve speech laid out a vision for China in 2025 and addressed some of these concerns. This post explores the highlights of President’s Xi’s vision for the coming year.
On December 31, 2024, President Xi Jinping delivered his 12th consecutive New Year message for 2025 (known as the 2025 Address). On this occasion, the New Year message provided a concise and focused reflection on the past year while also offering an outlook for the year ahead. How is the 2025 Address different from the previous ones? What are the codes of governance hidden in this oral executive summary?
Urging Confidence
President Xi exhorted Chinese citizens to be confident in the coming year:“As always, we grow in the wind and rain, and we get stronger through hard times. We must be confident.”In our memory and close watching of Chinese politics for many years, this is the first time China’s top leader has appealed for confidence from the people.
The current economic landscape in China is characterized by new challenges, namely uncertainties in the external environment and the transition from traditional to emerging growth drivers, which have impacted public confidence and business expectations. In 2024, “we have proactively responded to the impacts of the changing environment at home and abroad. We have adopted a full range of policies to make solid gains in pursuing high-quality development. China’s economy has rebounded and is on an upward trajectory, with its GDP for the year expected to pass the 130 trillion yuan mark”, Xi noted. He also emphasized that China can overcome these difficulties with hard work. However, while the macroeconomic data appear positive on the surface, they don’t fully reflect the real experiences of people, a discrepancy observed in both China and the United States.
Compare this vision with the wording of the 2024 Address, “Going forward, we have full confidence in the future.” How to boost confidence remains a big question for Beijing in 2025. Xi’s humble entreaty for people to be confident is a striking message on where the Chinese economy and society are today.
New Quality Productive Forces (新质生产力)
In the 2025 Address, the term “new quality productive forces” has supplanted the previously popular buzzwords “innovation (创新)” and “creation (创造)”. The shift to new quality productive forces is exemplified by the new energy vehicle industry, which for the first time surpassed an annual production output of 10 million vehicles. Breakthroughs have been made in integrated circuitry, artificial intelligence, and quantum communications, according to Xi. Taking semiconductors as an example, China has been actively establishing a comprehensive and self-sufficient supply chain to counter Washington’s tech barriers. This industry cluster covers production, manufacturing equipment, materials, and design software.
In 2025, further U.S.-China “Tech Decoupling” appears inevitable. As Beijing advances its initiatives for greater self-reliance and strength in science and technology (S&T), what skills will it master to maintain and secure the partnerships with American tech players in the forefront of the industry such as Apple and Tesla?
With the convening of the Third Plenary Session of the 20th CPC Central Committee in July 2024, China has entered a new “window of reform”. The 2025 Address dedicates the most space among the four most recent addresses on reform:
"At its Third Plenary Session, the 20th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China sounded a clarion call for further deepening all-round reform. We will march forward in great strides to advance reform and opening up as the trend of our times. We will surely embrace even broader prospects in pursuing Chinese modernization in the course of reform and opening up."
The success of China’s reform and opening-up policy, which began in late 1978, has led many to view reform as a panacea. However, it is precisely the achievements of prior reform and opening-up initiatives, along with the emergence of multiple stakeholders, that have significantly increased the complexity and challenges associated with further reforms.
As China’s reform process treads deeper waters, the “stones in the river” are more difficult to feel (1), resistance is mounting, and public expectations remain high. In today’s social and economic landscape where entrenched interests are more difficult to address than one’s soul (2), it is nearly impossible to create a reform plan that will satisfy all stakeholders. In 2025, China must grapple with how to push forward the reform tasks set by the Third Plenary Session of the 20th CPC Central Committee. Ensuring that the benefits of the reform and development are more accessible to the general public remains a significant challenge for reformers.
There is a common view in the Chinese mainland that the Taiwan issue is the biggest obstacle to achieve rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, and this obstacle is becoming more complex and difficult to solve with changes in geopolitics. Comparing the rhetoric surrounding the Taiwan issue in the New Year addresses of recent years, we conclude that Beijing has acknowledged the declining support for reunification among Taiwan residents.
As the prospect of reunification by force becomes an increasingly realistic scenario, the development and strengthening of military capabilities have become imperative. Though the 2025 Address does not mention the breakthroughs China has made in cutting-edge weapons, the end of 2024 became a carnival for military enthusiasts. Within one week, China unveiled an array of new weaponry. It appears that Beijing is conveying to President Trump that it is not intimidated by the prospect of conflict, so don’t take risks.
2023 marked the first year of China’s transition from its epidemic prevention and control measures prompted by the pandemic. Consequently, in the 2024 Address, the word “活力 (meaning vitality)”, appeared five times, underscoring the message that social life had returned to normal. Rather than using the word “活力” in the 2025 Address, Xi noted:
"On the new journey of Chinese modernization, everyone is a key actor, every effort counts, and every ray of light shines."
Indeed, turning around a sluggish economy and improving the vitality of Chinese society is contingent upon the collective efforts and sentiments of each individual.
