“Not everything that is faced can be changed, but nothing can be changed until it is faced.”
~ James Baldwin (1962)
Most models of good leadership don’t describe how to address the racial, social, or political rage and discord felt by employees or their psychological impact on teams and organizations. When workers bring intense emotions into the workplace, managers often deal with the immediate situation in one of several ways. These include seeking to calm or comfort individuals in order to return to workaday normalcy or, perhaps, to channel that energy toward more constructive ends. Another tactic is to pathologize individual anger or grief as a mental health issue to be dealt with by specialized colleagues or support groups. While many of these efforts may be well-intentioned, the aim of mitigation, re-direction, or referral is generally to move on quickly from emotions and their temporary disruption of team or organizational life.
The current unrest over systemic racism and police violence roiling U.S. cities offers a stark reminder that business leaders need to approach their colleagues’ rage and frustration differently. Rather than a transitory problem to be resolved and left behind, leaders need to work actively with people anguished and infuriated by endemic challenges with the longer-term goal of building a shared future. Particularly amidst the uncertainty created by the coronavirus, that imperative may seem a far cry from the priorities of many teams or businesses. Yet assuming deeply felt emotions around racial, social, and economic unrest will pass on their own or can be relegated to a generic category of mental or emotional health concern misses something fundamental and, sadly, enduring about the rage and pain and even hopelessness many are feeling.
Employee well-being and mental and emotional health themselves deserve greater attention and support from many leaders and organizations. These are vital and necessary resources, though, particularly for the current crisis, they are not sufficient. In fact, that attention and support should be made increasingly available as one aspect of a wider range of actions and resources to help employees and engage their intense feelings, frustration, and (often) fatigue. In particular, leaders should take action in these times of racial or social crisis by building on team or organizational priorities for concretely improving equity and inclusion. Even more urgently, they need to address the impact of institutional biases and exclusions and the resulting feelings of mistrust and disempowerment. Leaders can begin by taking several related actions.
Embracing Discomfort, Listening, and Learning
It is crucial now for business leaders to be pro-active about checking in with employees, particularly people of color, about their feelings and state of mind. Leaders then need to be present for others and open to their diverse perspectives and potentially raw emotions. Listening to colleagues filled with anger or pain, without being defensive, requires a willingness to remain reassuring and accept people and how they’re individually dealing with current events. Since every leader also needs to manage his own feelings and thoughts, this is a time for many to be disciplined in dealing with conflicting emotions, uncertainty, and discomfort. One helpful approach is for leaders to embrace the call by London Business School’sHerminia Ibarrato use the bigger-picture values and principles they aspire to (say, of human dignity, equality, and social justice) as bases for exploring their best possible everyday decisions and interactions with others. Often, this growth and development requires leaders to confront and commit to learning more about their own biases, beliefs, and privilege.
Shortly after AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson addressed thousands of employees at a September 2016 company diversity event, a video of his talk, “Tolerance Is for Cowards,” went viral on YouTube. The preceding summer had been notably divisive: after a spate of killings by police of Black civilians, more than 100 protests erupted in at least 88 American cities. Speaking of the pressing need for diverse employees to understand each other better, Stephenson indicated that any ongoing internal dialogue should begin with him. That intentional public commitment by the CEO, already made in the current crisis by many leaders, includingApple’s Tim Cook, sets an unmistakable tone of inclusiveness and rejection of racism and intolerance for an organization and its customers.
Demonstrating Empathy and Building a Culture of Safety
Offering opportunities for others to share feelings or thoughts is vital. Someresearchhas shown, in fact, that people can suffer at work when they can’t discuss the racial bias they face outside of it. By demonstrating empathy – for others’ feelings and ways of thinking or seeing the world, and by showing compassion – leaders provide the makings of a safe work setting. In her research onpsychological safety, Harvard Business School’s Amy Edmondson has shown how such settings, in which people can be vulnerable in the presence of others, support both meaningful interactions and enable learning about the team’s and organization’s work (and the accompanying performance). More specifically, a leader’s commitment to learning about his own biases and blind spots, as well as about historical and contemporary systems of racial injustice, can contribute to building a culture of safety and inclusion.
At the recentAdWeek 2020 Diversity and Inclusion Summit, Endeavor CMO Bozoma Saint John spoke powerfully about the need for corporate leaders (and brands) to acknowledge structural inequalities in the United States and to move beyond conversations about diversity and take more substantive actions. She concluded her interview with three takeaways: “1. Be Enraged, 2. Be Enraged, 3. Be Enraged.” Her combination of clear-sighted strategic thinking and acutely felt anger at the racist violence illustrates how leaders must embrace and work with their own and others’ complex responses to events and the underlying conditions driving them.
Acting Together to Drive Change
Anguished people aren’t problems to be solved. Whilehealthy and honest discussions about raceshould have multiple aims including learning and healing, as consultant Kira Hudson Banks argues, they should also help to determine the meaningful ways forward for a team or business. These need to be more than benign conversations about the post-pandemic future of work. They should prompt organizational action: expand the roles of Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) and Allyship and Mentoring programs; release public statements like Nike’s recent “For once, Don’t Do It” message about accepting the reality of racism; and permit employees to take off work time to participate in peaceful demonstrations (likePatagonia).
In 2016, after a spate of civilian and police deaths, the advertising agencyWieden+Kennedyre-posted on its homepage (with permission) an internal email written by a Black employee about #BlackLivesMatter and the fear of racist behavior he lived with every day. Such support for diverse employees in publicizing their perspectives goes beyond branding to become a powerful statement by the agency of the importance of open and positive dialogue. During the current crisis, Airbnb has published an “Activism & Allyship Guide,” prepared by the Black@ Airbnb ERG, as a resource guide for the company’s global community to learn more about and take further action against racism.
Advocate Vocally, Visibly, and Consistently
Supporting diverse colleagues and driving purposeful change within teams and organizations require everyday leadership. In part, this includes actively supporting diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) efforts – anti-bias training, recruitment and performance appraisal checklists, and ERGs – that many companies have already made. Yet as New York University Stern’s Dolly Chugh describes inThe Person You Mean to Be, social (and organizational) change is not typically made through big, bold actions. Rather, it is more effective to build change with everyday leadership – through the consistent efforts of leaders to educate and grow themselves, address micro-aggressions, engage people, and contribute to dismantling systems of privilege and discrimination.
For example, after the shootings of several unarmed Black men in the summer of 2017,Tim Ryan, U.S. chair and senior partner of PwC, organized a series of company-wide meetings around racial diversity and injustice. The gatherings generated insights for Ryan and others while providing a critical forum for people of color in the company to share their views and experiences. That internal initiative was embraced by colleagues, and Ryan went on to help launchCEO Action for Diversity and Inclusion, now a global coalition of more than 900 CEOs committed to advancing diversity and inclusion in the workplace. It can also be helpful for businesses to partner with existing social justice or advocacy groups, such as #BlackLivesMatter or the We Are All Human Foundation, asP&G’s Marc Pritchardhas recently done to leverage knowledge and other resources for change.
Today, we might add two further considerations for leaders. One is the realization that any such efforts by leaders will likely be complicated by continuing restrictions around in-person gatherings and social distancing to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. Yet it remains vital to connect with remote or distributed colleagues in order to listen, pledge support, and begin dialogues that can foster shared understanding and yield the basis for change. Remote-first companies, such asGitlab, offer relevant lessons in building more inclusive remote communications and cultures. Similarly, DEI specialists such asParadigmhave developed recommendations for more inclusive remote work that also support difficult dialogues.
Another overarching consideration during the current crisis is the wide range of resources available to help educate and support leaders and teams in their efforts to promote change. A new generation of activists and thinkers have spoken and written powerfully abouthow white people can talk about racismandbe activelyanti-racistrather than merelynon-racist. Likewise, recent management research provides helpful and updated accounts of the Black experience of workandhow businesses can take meaningful actions against racism. This work builds on a long history of analyses of racist mindsets, behaviors, and institutions in the United States, including writings byJames BaldwinandMalcolm X,and the landmark television series about the civil rights movement,Eyes on The Prize. Many more digital resources, such as the Smithsonian Institution’s “Talking About Race” web portal and theVienna Global Leaders’ guidefor business against racism are freely accessible to leaders, as people and citizens, to help them combat bias and inequality and effect change.
Racism, police violence, and social justice are enormously difficult topics for corporate leaders to address. However, staying silent or ignoring those issues promises even greater difficulties for businesses and their communities going forward. Referring to politicians at every level of government in the current crisis, Princeton historianJulian Zelizerobserved, “Good leaders cannot separate themselves from the turbulence. If they’re silent, or if they’re too distant, it just adds to the frustration people feel.” The same holds true for business leaders, who need to take meaningful actions that support their colleagues and help to build more equitable organizations and more just social and economic systems.
