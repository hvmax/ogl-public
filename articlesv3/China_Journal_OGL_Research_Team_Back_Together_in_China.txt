### China Journal: OGL Research Team Back Together in China

20 March 2025|China, China history, China politics, China Population, Chinese Culture
At On Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy and, in particular, life in China. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. We share our expertise about economic development in China and China’s economic reforms, U.S.-China relations, China’s changing role in the global political economy, and the history and current state of Chinese politics. We also aspire to help our Chinese audience understand broader changes in the global political economy. In this post, we discuss our most recent on-the-ground research trip, where OGL’s Guthrie joined the team in China to conduct research and give talks in Shanghai, Shenyang, and Beijing.
Just returned from an insightful trip to Shanghai, Beijing, and Shenyang, where I had the privilege of engaging with academics and business leaders shaping the future of innovation and industry. From university students to executives driving economic growth, the exchange of ideas was both inspiring and thought-provoking.
These engagements reinforced the importance of cross-sector collaboration and the value of global perspectives in tackling complex challenges. Looking forward to building on these conversations and exploring new opportunities for partnership, innovation, and impact.
