### Some Thoughts on China’s Latest Economic Data

17 February 2022|China, Economic Development, Geopolitics
AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy and, in particular, life in China. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. We have written a series about the strength oflocal economic development in China’s 2nd and 3rd tier citiesandentrepreneurship in China today. We have written aboutinnovation in the Chinese economyandeconomic developmentas it relates tosocial inequality. We have also written about thestrategy and logic of local economic development in China’s reform era. This post focuses on China’s latest economic data.

How should we think about China’s economic performance in 2021 and what does that performance tell us about the coming year? And, importantly, how can we help foreign investors think about this performance?
Recently, President Biden made the pronouncement that “For the first time in 20 years, our economy grew faster than China’s.”
The statement was puzzling to economists and China watchers as it doesn’t match the reality of the situation. China’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew by 8.1% in 2021, while the United States' GDP grew at 5.7%. It is true that the US grew at the highest rate it has grown since 1984, so congratulations on that.
However, we were all left wondering what President Biden means by this statement. It is clear that there are a number of pundits and outlets that continue to make arguments for the backward nature of the Chinese economy (e.g.,here), but arguing that the US economy grew faster than the Chinese economy is, quite simply, false. Regardless of the comparisons between national GDP growth rates – and, by the way, both 8.1% and 5.7% are good GDP growth numbers for advanced industrialized nations in the pandemic era – let’s dig in to the Chinese economic numbers here.
For China, 8.1% is higher than the target 6% proposed by Premier Li Keqiang in his March 2021Government Work Report. The GDP in the four quarters of 2021 grew by 18.3%, 7.9%, 4.9%, and 4.0% on year-on-year basis respectively, compared with the same period in 2019. The two-year average growth rate of each quarter is 4.9%, 5.5%, 4.9%, and 5.2%.
Meanwhile, China’s population almost stops growing during this period. By the end of 2021, the population of mainland China had reached 1,412.6 million, an increase of 480,000, the natural population growth rate is only 0.34‰. China's GDP per capita in US dollars jumps by an astounding 19.5% over 2020, reaching $12,551 (￥80,976), its total GDP reaches $17.7 trillion, 77% of that of the United States in 2021 (2).
In Figure 2, we compiled China’s 2019-2021 GDP, the value-added of primary, secondary, and tertiary industries, and four economic sectors with the fastest and slowest growth in terms of value-added. The growth rate of the information technology sector ranks No. 1, showing the result of economic structure transformation. Benefiting from strong exports, with a 21.2% increase over 2020, the sector of industry and manufacturing surprisingly ranks the third and fourth respectively. The bottom four sectors all belong to tertiary industries, of which real estate is subject to strict regulation in the second half of the year, and the other three sectors are dragged down by strict COVID-19 control measures. While the added-value of these service sectors may seem relatively minor, they do employ a large percentage of the work force, their downturn has seriously affected people's direct perceptions of the economy and expectations for the future.
From the components of GDP by expenditure (Figure 3), final consumption has made the biggest contribution for China’s economic development. However, the two-year average growth rate of the total retail sales of consumer goods was 4.3%, indicating that consumption has not recovered as expected under repeated waves of COVID-19. Gross capital formation includes gross fixed capital formation and change in inventories. This data mirrors sluggish investment and reluctance to increase inventories. In essence, market players are not optimistic about China’s economic outlook. The two-year average growth rate of fixed-asset investment contracts to 3.9%, mixed by improving manufacturing, bottoming out real estate, and tepid infrastructure. Net export is the strongest component that maintained its contribution in 2021 after a robust 2020.
From the three Q4 2021 survey reports released by the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) (3) on December 31, 2021, we can draw similar conclusions. Results from the Urban Depositor Survey Report are the weakest, all indexes are lower than Q4 2019. People’s willingness to spend is far from restored. The Entrepreneur Survey performs better, with the exception of the profitability index, though declined slightly but remains positive, all major operating indexes have improved. Among banker surveys, the loan index for all-sized firms fell, especially for small and micro-sized firms. This is another sign of a pessimistic outlook, and entrepreneurs put “survival” as primary strategy so they are reluctant to borrow more.
The Chinese government’s revenue contains general public budget revenue (mainly taxes) and government funds (for local governments, the majority of this section is the revenue from selling use rights of state land). From the fiscal revenue data released by the Ministry of Finance (4), we have the following takeaways:
In 2020, while tax revenue was significantly reduced, land-selling income increased notably, while in 2021 the situation was exactly the opposite.The results of tax and fee-reduction policies of the central government are mainly reflected in the reduction of VAT and corporate income tax, which can be verified with the results in Entrepreneurs Survey (Figure 4).To many people’s surprise, the growth rate of personal income tax is much higher than that of the economy and other taxes, particularly dazzling and painful in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.
• In 2020, while tax revenue was significantly reduced, land-selling income increased notably, while in 2021 the situation was exactly the opposite.
• The results of tax and fee-reduction policies of the central government are mainly reflected in the reduction of VAT and corporate income tax, which can be verified with the results in Entrepreneurs Survey (Figure 4).
• To many people’s surprise, the growth rate of personal income tax is much higher than that of the economy and other taxes, particularly dazzling and painful in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Compared with the 6% GDP growth target and 12.9% nominal GDP growth, China’s fiscal spending in 2021 appears conservative. In 2021, the general public budget expenditure is ￥2.46 trillion, a year-on-year increase of 0.3%. Among them, the central government expenditure has decreased 0.1% to￥3,505 billion; the local expenditure has slightly increased 0.3% to ￥2.11trillion. Without the endorsement of the central financial support, it is natural for local governments and enterprises to hesitate on more fixed assets investments.
At the operational level, local governments are the biggest engines to drive China’s economic development. They act like  business units with P&L responsibility in big corporations, turn Beijing’s blue print into actions and results. In 2021, China’s North-South economic gap kept widening. With GDP surpassing South Korea and Russia, Guangdong and Jiangsu are the two most economically powerful provinces in China. Among the top 10 Chinese cities ranked by GDP, Beijing is the only city in northern China (5), the Yangtze River Delta has four slots, the Pearl River Delta and Chengdu - Chongqing region has two slots each. Beijing produced 5 billion COVID-19 vaccines in 2021, driving its GDP growth to 8.5%. New energy vehicles are the new economic driver in Shanghai, annual output has increased by 1.9 times to 632,000 vehicles, and Tesla alone contributed half a million units (6). Shenzhen, China’s star city, has been slowed down by the China-US. trade war and the regulation of the Internet and real estate industries.
Overall, there is little surprise in China’s 2021 economic score card. While the 8.1% growth rate may seem high, two-year average of 2020 and 2021 is 5.1%, a step down from 6%+ in the years before COVID-19. In order to speed up the transformation of its economic structure, Beijing has launched some harsh measures in 2021, such as strengthening Internet governance and real estate regulation. Strict COVID-19 prevention and control measures combined with economic restructuring have resulted in a situation that China's economic growth rate started strong and ended weak.
More worthy of attention than statistics and data are the perceptions of ordinary people and market players. For most Chinese families, there is a hard budget constraint on household consumption. Without expectations of improvements in wealth and income, people can’t anticipate strong spending growth. Similarly, lacking good projects that can bring positive cash flow has lowered the willingness of local governments and enterprises to invest more, when the prospects are uncertain, it is preferable to operate prudently rather than to be blindly optimistic.
The Central Economic Work Conference in December 2021 pointed out that the Chinese economy is facing pressure from declining demand, supply shocks, and weakening outlook. The external environment is becoming increasingly complicated, grim and uncertain. The meeting called on “all regions and departments to assume responsibility for stabilizing the macroeconomy, and all sides to take the initiative and launch policies conducive to economic stability” (7). After the conference, the central and local governments held symposiums to appease and cheer up private and foreign enterprises. Entering 2022, a large number of infrastructure projects in various provinces went into intensive development, and the PBC has also cut RRR (Reserve Requirement Ratio) and interest rates.
In 2022, as long as China’s GDP growth rate is not less than 5%, we should not be focusing on specific growth numbers. Instead, our focus should be on what measures Beijing has taken to motivate local governments and entrepreneurs and the effectiveness of these measures.
After building a moderately prosperous society in many respects -- the first centennial goal of the CPC -- in 2021, the next goal is to build China into a modern economy by 2049, the centenary of the PRC, and to fully realize the national rejuvenation for the Chinese nation. Justin Lin, a famous and respected Chinese economist, proposed that from now to 2049, China’s average annual per capita income level must increase 2.5% faster than that of the U.S. in order to achieve Mission 2049 – China’s per capita GDP in terms of purchasing power parity (PPP) will reach half that of the US, and its economic output will be twice the size of the United States. Lin’s concern is that “if the US economy grows faster than China’s for a year or two, it may lead to excessive interpretation by people who do not understand the laws of the economy, and affect the confidence in China both at home and abroad.” (8)
For what it’s worth, OGL's prediction is that China is going to overtake the United States as the largest economy in the world in 2028. And we would emphasize here that the economy -- its success and failure -- is among the biggest political issues for China today.

3. PBC started the Entrepreneur Survey in 1992. Some 5,000 industrial firms are surveyed nationwide (excluding Tibet) on seven aspects of business operation. The Urban Depositor survey is established by the PBC in 1999. Fifty depositors are selected randomly on a quarterly basis from each of 400 bank outlets in 50 large, medium and small-sized cities across the country to make up a survey sample of altogether 20,000 depositors. PBC started the Banker Survey in 2004, surveying approximately 3,200 banking institutions nationwide. Most indexes in these survey reports are calculated using the diffusion index approach, i.e., a weight of 1 to the “good/increase” option, 0.5 to “mediocre/unchanged”, and 0 to “poor/decrease”). An index reading above 50% indicates an upward trend or expansion while an index below 50% is a sign of a downward trend or contraction.
4. Chinese fiscal data is calculated in present value, and some official economic growth figures are adjusted for inflation, such as GDP growth rate.
