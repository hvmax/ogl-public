### A Conversation About Leadership

16 October 2020|Creative Leadership, Everyday Leadership, Leadership, Leadership Development
On Global Leadership has a long history of thinking deeply about leadership development, and our team has been at the forefront of the Creative Leadership and Systems Leadership approaches. In this post, we talk in more detail about Creative Leadership and its overlap with Everyday Leadership -- two approaches to leadership that hold great promise for corporations looking to fully engage their entire workforces in supporting, guiding, and leading their organizations. -- The OGL Editors
A Conversation about Leadership
Let’s toss out the common and antiquated business school notion of leadership, one where superstar CEOs and executives shoot to the top because of their combination of charisma and inspiration. Instead, we’ll start this conversation with our On Global Leadership (OGL) view: Leadership is not reserved for the C-suite, or the highest levels of management in a company. Leadership is a priority for everyone. Leadership for you, as an individual, comes from decisions you make, how you approach your job and how you interact with people in your organization. It’s how you pick up the phone and connect with a client or constituent. In this sense, leadership happens at every level of the organization, and people at all those levels must be encouraged to step up to take on authority and leadership, regardless of their titles.
Recently, there’s been an antiquated approach to leadership development that focuses so much on people at the top of organizations that it strips any semblance of leadership and authority from the majority of people who make up the company.  We often think of leaders as being smarter, more charismatic, and more inspiring than everyone else inside the organization. As such, it’s produced the destructive myth of the natural leader, one who is born to power, and with the idea that you can only succeed if you are a member of the elite and inclusive membership club.
The majority of leadership professors and scholars are “micro” in their orientation (so more on the M-I end of the spectrum). Most of them come out of the fields of psychology or Micro-Organizational Behavior, which focuses on the psychological aspects of interpersonal interaction in the workplace.
There is a second group or movement that has been central to the development of leadership education over the last 40 years. Let’s call it the Harvard School. In his 1977 essay, “Managers and Leaders: Are They Different?”, Harvard Business School Professor Abraham Zaleznik dramatically changed the trajectory of leadership scholarship, and not for the better in my view. By turning leadership into a personality trait, Zaleznik laid the foundation for the cult-based view of leaders. Only visionary, charismatic and inspiring individuals need apply for the ranks of leadership. This view of leadership is wrong and depressing.
For us, the key question at this point is: how do you create an effective organization culture that will serve the strategic imperatives of the organization? You create an organization where everyone is invested in seeing the organization’s success and guiding the path there.
We think of leadership as creating an effective organizational space in which people can thrive within their work environment while having access to tools that help them create expertise and gain experience. We don’t think leadership has much to do with whether you have authority or not, and who are your direct reports. It has more to do with how you approach your work, and that applies whether you’re at the bottom or the top of the organization. And frankly, if you believe that leadership is about when you have a structural position to lead, you're not going to be the person who actually thinks actively about leadership every day and how to strengthen those around you. The person who might make the best leader is usually not the obvious choice, and a savvy manager understands and sees the possibilities in everyone around them.
Some think of leadership as something that is earned in crisis, where you actually are able to remain calm and think through the problems and challenges in real time. Yet, that has very little to do with traditional leadership because we don’t select leaders based on how they’re going to do in crisis because we don’t know until the crisis arrives. Even if we did, wo we really want somebody who's effective 99% of the time, the day-to-day work of the company, or somebody who will be effective 1% of the time when a crisis exists? The 99% makes more sense. But how do we get there?
Creative Leadership
Creative Leadership is built on the idea that everyone at every level in the organization is a leader; that leaders must know themselves, alert to their failings and graces, to better serve the organization; and that only by mastering complexity – both human and organizational – will leaders be able to achieve alignment.
The structure of leadership teaching (and research) has broken down along four levels of traditional analysis: (1) vision and strategy—how well does an individual understand the competitive environment in which their organization is embedded, and how well can they create the competitive advantage the help this organization win in the market?; (2) alignment—given that strategy, how well is this organization going to be able to be aligned to meet these strategic ends?; (3) interpersonal motivation—how well is this leader and this organization going to be above to motivate people to work for these ends?; (4) and introspection—how well is this individual going to be able to think about him or herself in an honest way? This is often referred to as the V-A-M-I framework—Vision, Alignment, Motivation and Introspection.
The majority of leadership professors and scholars are “micro” in their orientation (so more on the M-I end of the spectrum). Most of them come out of the fields of psychology or Micro-Organizational Behavior, which focuses on the psychological aspects of interpersonal interaction in the workplace.

By turning leadership into a personality trait, Zaleznik laid the foundation for the cult-based view of leaders. Only visionary, charismatic and inspiring individuals need apply for the ranks of leadership. This view of leadership is wrong and depresses me.
Human resources professionals often talk pay and incentives, but I think motivation relates directly to how much people perceive whether you are listening to them or not. Listening is much more crucial. In my leadership classes, I would spend less than 20 percent of the time on personalized motivation, but I realize now that this is probably more important than anything else in the leadership oeuvre.
Introspection & Motivation
Leaders need to ask hard questions, but first and foremost, they must pose those questions to themselves. How much are you thinking about and analyzing yourself, your own motivations, you own anxieties and your own goals? To what extent are you being honest about all of these issues? I have always thought being honest and real is an important part of leadership, but it was always given short shrift in the classroom.
Taking a step back and assessing yourself honestly and critically, admitting where you have made mistakes and failed, and adjusting your course in response to those failures are truly the marks of creative leaders. People often realize they have spent a lot of time thinking strategically and trying to convince people of the importance of the organization’s strategic vision and not spending nearly enough time listening and engaging. A rookie mistake from a leadership perspective and a hard lesson learned.
Complexity & Alignment
One of the other central tenets of our theory of Creative Leadership is the importance of complexity and alignment within the organization, as well as its relationship to nurturing and sustaining dynamic organizations and creative leaders.
Complexity and alignment have been constants in organizational theory in the past, though often casually dismissed as the duty of managers and not the province of visionary leaders. Recent calls to focus on complexity are welcomed, but they also miss the point by stressing only the inner psychology. In our view, both are ultimately shortsighted. Both are damaging to leaders striving to build great organizations.
Thanks largely to globalization and the revolution in information technology, institutions have become far more complex. The distance between New York and Bangalore has been reduced to mere bits and bytes, allowing organizations to grow beyond the constraints of time and place. These changes naturally introduce more competition, processes and sophistication.
Moreover, individuals at every level of the organization contribute to complexity as employees look for new ways to achieve strategic goals or add value. It is this element of human dynamics in the workplace that injects another level of complexity – one that cannot always be addressed with a process or system change, or the right mental state. Instead, it demands a more robust and profound understanding of creative leadership inside organizations.
The creative leader sees opportunity in this organizational and human complexity. By analyzing the organization and by focusing on the power of alignment, leaders create harmony among all the various components of the organization. The result? What we all want: a culture of innovation and change. Witnessing lagging performance, we are too quick to point to the poor vision of uncharismatic leaders; or we call for deep cultural change. Yes, great leaders and cultures of innovation drive business success. But leadership and values are also emergent traits: they come from building environments where thought, behavior and group dynamics can align. We believe that understanding organizational complexity can provide unheralded opportunities for change.
The infinite complexity of the organization and the individuals who make up its workforce should be celebrated. Good leaders understand that complexity adds depth, and they embrace it. In fact, we would argue they embrace both the intricate workings of individual and organizational complexity. When leaders follow the typical mindset of strategy and economics – simplifying assumptions and working toward theoretical abstractions – they gravitate toward what is common, comfortable and known. By embracing complexity, leaders can find endless opportunities to create something new. The real world is much more exciting and interesting than the staid assumptions of theoretical mathematical models.
Much of today’s business whether in the private or public sector is carried out by complex organizations that are populated by individuals with varying capabilities. Not everyone has the same strength or aspiration. Only by developing a deeper understanding of the organization – both internally and in relationship to the wider ecology – can leaders create environments that catalyze human potential and align the institution for success.
Alignment must not be a secondary objective – nor can it be seen as a simple byproduct of great vision or culture. And analysis is not what happens in the dark corners, among the quants and technocrats. Great leaders analyze their organizations continuously, seeking out strategic alignments that invigorate everyone to meet their goals.
To get the right fit of strategy, processes and people, leaders ask the hard questions about their institution and their goals, as well as analyze the capacities of each individual worker. Leaders need strategic road maps that help the organization and individuals, both separately and together, achieve clearly defined outcomes.
People always think a leader is, quite simply, the person with the grandest title, but maybe it’s really somebody who actually knows where the organization needs to go. You can have that vision from the lowest rung of the ladder, deeply understanding what motivates your colleagues and what can take the organization to the next phase of development.
Finally, the most basic building block of leadership -- trust, which is an integral component of our thinking around Creative Leadership. Trust allows for a covenant between leaders and their colleagues and employees, providing the foundation for interpersonal bonds that lead to organizational success. Most problems in the workplace, although some bosses might disagree, stem from a lack of trust.
Since our theory of Creative Leadership is built on the idea that everyone at every level in the organization is a leader, yet leadership without trust is often a hollow victory because there is no guarantee it can be sustained. Much is made of trust in interpersonal relationships, political life and general society, but there is not nearly enough focus on the role of trust within complex business organizations. A trust-based ecosystem builds confidence and certainty. Of course, that doesn’t mean that leaders won’t have to make difficult decisions that impact lives, but there is a way of approaching these things that does not undermine trust.
The four decades of corporate greed and wrongdoing has taken their toll on trust in the workplace. Outsourcing, financial scandals, exorbitant CEO pay and downsizing have helped to create an environment of anxiety, fear and suspicion in corporate America. While understandable, it is toxic. Without organizational trust, morale wanes, productivity declines and profits disappear. Distrust inside an organization is a poison, one that spreads with an insidious speed and with disastrous consequences. Trust brings respect for the organization and its leaders. It allows employees to feel invested in the organization and to fully contribute, whether offering solutions or daring to take informed and necessary risks.
We have found, and believe quite passionately, that good people need to trust their leaders, and leaders must strive to trust their people. Building an organizational culture of trust is perhaps the most important thing a leader can do to build a successful organization, regardless of whether the leader is the CEO or a mid-level manager or a junior employee fresh on the job.
