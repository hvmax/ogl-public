### China's Oppressed White-Collar Class: The Curious Case of Netease

In the 1980s and 1990s,  China was often targeted for labor abuses. A number of organizations,  from labor unions in the United States to Human Rights Watch and Amnesty  International, placed China under scrutiny for overworking blue-collar  labor class. And, to some extent, this international criticism was  accurate: China was allowing for the exploitation of a massive labor  force to build a manufacturing juggernaut, one that would reshape the  global economy as the manufacturer for the world.
For those of us  who were watching China closely in the mid-1990s, these criticisms  seemed to become more and more unfair. For one thing, in its bid to join  the World Trade Organization (WTO), China was working hard to display  to the world its new respect for labor rights. The clearest example of  this shift was the passage of The Labor Law (1994), which set out  extensive protections for manufacturing labor rights, including  aggressive limits on working hours, mandates for overtime pay, and the  like. In the years that followed, we also saw laws like The Contract  Labor Law (2008) and The Dispatch Labor Law (2015).
In China  today, a new set of labor scandals are sweeping the country, and the  group of people who feel most oppressed and aggrieved are the  white-collar workers in China’s fast-growing high-tech industry.
Let’s  begin with the case of NetEase. Most people have heard of NetEase, as  it has become a gaming juggernaut over the last two decades – second  only to Tencent, which recently took over the #1 position as the world’s  largest gaming company. Founded in 1997 and taken public in 2000,  NetEase has become one of the great success stories of China’s growing  high-tech economy. Recently, the company has also become emblematic of  the abuse of workers in the high-tech sector. Long work hours and a  brutal attitude toward laying off “older workers” (reportedly anyone  over 35 is viewed as “old” in China’s high-tech sector) are common  tropes in discussions about China’s tech sector.
On November 23,  2019, a WeChat post entitled “Your Game My Heart” went viral. The author  wrote, “NetEase layoffs, security guards kick me, with serious illness,  out of the company. The nightmare of my personal experience in NetEase!  – Persecution, calculation, surveillance, fabrication, threats and  violent layoffs I experienced at NetEase.” Claiming he was fired because  of an unspecified terminal illness, the author went on to say,  “Although I am just nobody, although I know that an ant cannot shake an  elephant, but now I am bullied, even if the elephant is standing in  front of me, I must defend my rights fairly.” Within two days, the post  had garnered 280 million views. On November 29, the two parties (NetEase  and the employee) posted that they had “reconciled” and “reached an  agreement.” Despite the “reconciliation,” however, a national  conversation had begun.
First,  even with the new labor laws on the books in the reform era, China has a  long history of taking its population for granted. In the  post-revolution era, Mao’s policies sought to deploy the Chinese  population in industrialization with the goal of “leaping” past Britain  and the United States. The Great Leap Forward was ridiculously  ill-conceived, and tens of millions of people died in the famine that  followed. And before the Chinese labor reforms that came in the 1990s,  it was certainly the case that China took advantage of the massive  population that were willing to work in factories to make China the  manufacturer for the world. So, this is not new. And when the regulation  of labor entered the equation in the 1990s, the focus was on  manufacturing labor, while the exploitation of white-collar labor was  left untouched.
Second, this dynamic is not unique to China. The  United States, for example, has a storied history of supporting the  rights of blue-collar laborers while leaving unexamined the grueling  work hours of young white-collar employees. A number of authors and  industry insiders have documented this plight. As former investment  banker, Andrew Gutman, has written that young banker analysts and  associates often log 100-hour work weeks. And, like China’s tech  industry, Silicon Valley is not immune. As Joscelin Cooper recently  wrote on the “My Say” Forbes Column, “Working marathon hours is part of  Silicon Valley’s DNA.”[1]So the dynamic of oppressed white-collar workers is not new.
Third,  the interesting thing about China, however, is the unabashed nature of  the conversations among Chinese high-tech executives. It is striking to  hear Chinese business leaders talk about these issues. For years,  Chinese high-tech companies have extolled the virtues of the “996” work  week (9am to 9pm, 6 days a week). And NetEase is not alone in this  mindset. Alibaba’s founder, Jack Ma, defended the mindset at one point,  saying, “996 is a blessing, salute to hard workers.” The CEO of JD.com,  Liu Qiangdong, has his own take on 996: believing 996 is too lax, he  prefers what he calls 8116+8 (8am to 11pm, six days a week, plus 8 hours  on Sunday). When netizens questioned this attitude, CEO Liu glibly  chastised the questioners, saying, “loiters are not my brothers.” Now,  people who have worked with the JD.com CEO will readily point out that  Mr. Liu demands of himself just as hard as he demands of his workers.  Never mind that Mr. Liu is worth about $6 Billion.
Fourth, the  viral nature of this conversation among the population also tells us  something. The viral spread of this post was certainly symptomatic of a  broader ethos that is shaking China’s tech industry. As a number of  scholars and pundits have argued, China’s growing middle class is among  the most powerful economic forces in China and perhaps the world.[1]And  many of the workers in China’s growing high-tech sector would be  counted among this emerging power. This is the group of people who have  given stability to China’s authoritarian government – as long as people  continue to become wealthier and live better lives, people have  basically been willing to allow the one-party system to continue on. But  there is growing discontent here. In addition to the workweek demands,  people in this sector and this middle class increasingly feel taken  advantage of, overlooked, cast aside. Take, for example, the language  that China’s tech industry coders use to describe themselves: Manong  [码农] (coding farmers, peasant coders). Given China’s class system and  the ways in which China’s white-collar workers view themselves, the  emergence of the term manong indicates a sense of class angst, a sense  of oppression. The sense here is: “yes, maybe our lives have gotten  better over the last forty years, but we are still feeling that sense of  expendability.” For many years, since the beginning of China’s economic  reforms, the vast majority of people have believed that things are  going to get better and better; but today things feel more uncertain  than they have in a long time.
With respect to the viral spread of  ideas like this discontent, our analysis also suggests that the nature  of viral messaging over social media is different in China than other  places in the world. The social media phenomenon is a global phenomenon,  but the spread of information and opinions in China can take on a  different tone from other places in the world. It is not an exaggeration  to say that information can spread like wildfire in China. People are  thirsty for information in China and they are eager to share. It is also  the case that the social media platforms are more pervasive in Chinese  society. There are 970 million Chinese citizens on WeChat. So, when  portals like Sohu.com, Sina.com and QQ begin pushing content out to  WeChat groups (as was the case in the NetEase situation), pretty  quickly, one person’s ideas are reaching hundreds of millions of WeChat  users.
The interesting question now is: what impact might this  dustup have? In the short term, the overwhelming shared sentiment has  had an immediate impact on NetEase. Less than a week after the original  post, NetEase management announced that it had formed a commission to  look into the treatment of the man and had issued a formal apology. The  longer-term impact is less clear. On the one hand, the government is  unlikely to step into a labor conversation about the long work hours of  tech industry employees. The balance is a difficult one, because the  government has worked hard to co-opt this sector in part as these  companies provide the data for social monitoring programs. But it is  interesting to see such rapid spread of ideas surrounding corporate  practices. It will also be interesting to see what will happen as the  world’s most powerful middle class becomes more anxious and begins to  flex its muscles.
