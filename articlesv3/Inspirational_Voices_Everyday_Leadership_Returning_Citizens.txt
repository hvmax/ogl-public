### Inspirational Voices: Everyday Leadership & Returning Citizens

2 August 2023|Creative Leadership, Leadership, Leadership Development
AtOn Global Leadership, we have developed a new theory of leadership that steers away from the C-Suite, the charismatic leader approach to leading. Instead, we focus on what people do as leaders in their lives on a daily basis – every day everyone a leader. We have written about this concept in several articles (see, e.g.,here), profiling people likeDov Gelman,Jiyin Wang, andBrayden Harrington(and for the humility emphasis in everyday leadership, seehereandhere). We have been finding inspiration in our work withViaPath Corporationin support of the company’s work with Returning Citizens. This post is a continuation of anearlier piecewe wrote about On Global Leadership’s theory of Everyday Leadership and the work we have been doing in this area around leadership teaching and coaching with incarcerated individuals and Returning Citizens.
A little over a year ago, a friend who was involved with a group of Returning Citizens had read some of my writing on Everyday Leadership and thought it might be interesting for them. I spoke to this group a few times and was eventually invited by the inspirational leader Tony Lowden, Chief Social Impact Officer of ViaPath Technologies, inc., to help build an Everyday Leadership program for incarcerated individuals and returning citizens. ViaPath’s tagline is “Breaking the Cycle of Incarceration with Education,” and it was an honor to be invited to work with this group of visionary leaders.
Recently, I attended the official launch party of the ViaPath Foundation. It was a truly inspiring event. It was also a great reminder of the challenges some people have faced to rise up and become true leaders in their own right.

The Foundation has been operating for over a year and has been awarding grants to support organizations that work with the children of incarcerated individuals and, more generally, at-risk youth. At this event, I met many inspiring people who are becoming OGL collaborators and friends in this area. I spent time with Sidney Davis, who is a humble leader. Sidney’s story has been told in other venues, such asThe Washington Post(e.g.,here). When you meet Sidney, you are struck with a strong sense of his leadership and his drive to have a positive impact on the lives and opportunities of Returning Citizens. His drive is balanced with a soft-spoken sense of humility.

I also spoke with Dr. Ron Garrett and Alexander Campbell. Ron completed his doctorate while in prison. Alexander completed his BA while incarcerated and then pursued further degrees upon his release. Both of these individuals are deeply committed to helping incarcerated individuals and Returning Citizens find a way back to a productive life post incarceration. It is an inspiration to work with both of them, and I have learned so much about reaching certain populations through my work with these two men.

Louis Sawyer, Mike Stanley, and Christopher Washington,  members of the ViaPath Returning Citizens Advisory Group, were there, and it was wonderful to find time to talk with them as well. I met the well-known Returning Citizen, Brandon Chrostowski, who has built the remarkable institution serving Returning Citizens,Edwins Leadership and Restaurant Institute. (Meeting Brandon was a bit like one of those star-struck moments I have had in the past when I finally get to meet a creative leader I have been studying and writing about for some time.)

We then listened to the ViaPath leadership team speak at the launch. We heard from ViaPath Chief Executive Officer Deb Alderson and Chief Social Impact Officer Tony Lowden, both of whom spoke about ViaPath's amazing and inspiring vision for changing the lives of Returning Citizens.
Because this was an event for the launch of the ViaPath Foundation, they spoke about the organizations the ViaPath Foundation has been supporting. We then heard from several of the grantee organizations, entities that are step by step leading the way to positively impact the lives of Returning Citizens and their families.

What I find particularly impressive about the Foundation is its vision for its work. It wants to:
Generate meaningful, positive, creative change and opportunities among individuals with experiences with the judicial system.Expand the ways that ViaPath Technologies and the people in the communities we serve can get to know each other better.Explore and advance new ideas and be willing to take risks to achieve our mission.

Our final speaker of the night at the launch was Frank Murphy. Author ofThe Man Behind the Helmet: The God of Second Chances, Frank was incarcerated as a youth. In prison and later through his support network, Frank found a second chance (and redemption), eventually making it to the NFL, living out a successful career there, and then going on to write a book, become a motivational speaker, found a charity, and help at-risk youth find their path.
All in all, it was a striking evening with awe-inspiring people: People stepping up and leading, people finding a way to make the world around them a little better, helping one person at a time. Everyday Leadership is right in front of us. Everyone, Everyday, a Leader.
