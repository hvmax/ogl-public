### Everyday Leadership: Returning Citizens

29 June 2023|Creative Leadership, Everyday Leadership, Leadership Development
AtOn Global Leadershipwe have developed a new theory of leadership that steers away from the C-Suite, the charismatic leader approach to leading, and instead focuses on what people do as leaders in their lives on a daily basis – every day everyone a leader. We have written about this concept in several articles, profiling people likeDov Gelman,Jiyin Wang, andBrayden Harrington(and for the humility emphasis in everyday leadership, seehereandhere). In this post, we highlight the leadership surrounding and the leadership voices within the Returning Citizens movement.
Lessons in Everyday Leadership: Tony Lowden, Dan Wright, and Returning Citizens
Over the last three years,Everyday Leadershiphas become a core concept behindOn Global Leadership’s teaching, coaching, and thought leadership. As we have developed our theory of Everyday Leadership, we have contrasted our view with the bombastic, charismatic leadership of today: In the last few decades, society has come to worship the charismatic leader – strong in crisis, magnetic in personality, and passionate of vision. Yet, after years of the born-to-lead culture, today’s public space is sorely lacking individuals who are capable of mastering their organizations, leading movements and inspiring change. We sadly overlook, however, the people who are in the trenches, quietly toiling away to make their small parcel of the world a little better every day. Many of them are leaders, too. They are the leaders that might matter the most.
The core concept behind our thinking, teaching, and coaching around leadership is this: leadership is not about the position you are in or the number of followers you have; it is about the decisions you make every day to make the people and the world around you a little better. It could be the entry-level member of a team who sees the team dynamics and works to subtly change the team culture. It could be a friend who goes out of his or her way to motivate or console a friend in need. It could be a member of a community organization working diligently to help the organization achieve its goals. It could be someone who chooses to have the courage to be vulnerable with a friend or colleague to build an emotional connection with that person. It could be someone who has experienced hard knocks in life and is working to rebuild their life and be present for the people around him or her. Everyone, every day, a leader.
We should note here that our approach to leadership does not dismiss the importance of the leaders at the top of the pyramid, most of whom have worked for a lifetime to achieve their positions of power and influence. Our goal, however, is to broaden the conception of leadership so that all individuals – all members of an organization, a team, a group, a family – see themselves as potentially acting with leadership qualities at every moment, regardless of the position they occupy.
Recently, our team has been engaged with teaching our leadership philosophy to a new group of students, and it has been a truly inspiring experience. A little over a year ago, a lifelong friend, Dan Wright, invited me to give a talk on Everyday Leadership to a group of Returning Citizens. At the time, this was a new term to me. For readers that may not be familiar with the term, Returning Citizens are individuals who have spent significant time in prison and have returned to their lives outside of prison. I was intrigued but was also a little puzzled as to whether I was the right person for this audience. After all, I have no specific expertise in the legal system, the prison system, life after prison, etc. Dan was familiar with my work and interests – we have followed each other’s careers, as we have some overlapping areas of interest and we have become close friends over the years – and he asked me to have faith and give it a shot. He had read some of my writing on Everyday Leadership, and he had listened to me talk about the issue over the years, and he felt sure there could be a fit.
A little about Dan. He is a wonderful, successful, thoughtful person. In addition to building a very successful China advisory business, in recent years, Dan became interested in and deeply engaged with the Returning Citizen population. He began building relationships in the Returning Citizen community and formed a friendship with Returning Citizen Sidney Davis. Listening to his passion for building relationships in this community was without a doubt one of the more striking moments of Everyday Leadership in practice that I have witnessed in my life.
I accepted Dan’s invitation and traveled to Washington to give a talk about Everyday Leadership to a group of Returning Citizens. A group was pulled together to see if my Everyday Leadership ideas resonated with them, and to see if it would be a good topic for incarcerated individuals who were beginning to think about their lives after prison. I didn’t do much teaching, not in the formal sense, but there was a lot of learning, especially from my end.
Enter Tony Lowden. Tony is a rockstar in the prison reform and Returning Citizens field, having devoted his career to these issues. Tony has worked on prison reform with various political administrations including those of San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown, California Governor Pete Wilson, and eventually as “Re-Entry Czar” for former President Donald Trump. He has also served as the Pastor for Jimmy Carter’s church in Plains, Georgia, hand-picked by President Carter. Today, Pastor Lowden serves as the Chief Social Impact Officer for ViaPath, a leading provider of reintegration services for incarcerated individuals.
In June 2023, about a year after my first introduction to the Returning Citizens group, I was invited back to explore the delivery of Everyday Leadership for Returning Citizens. Tony and Dan brought together another advisory group of Returning Citizens, and we talked about how Everyday Leadership thinking could serve incarcerated individuals. I cannot describe what an inspiration it was to be in a room with these gentlemen. The thoughtfulness, depth, and personal introspection of the men in that room was truly a gift. It was an unbelievable lesson in and display of everyday leadership. These were not individuals attending to share woe-as-me stories about their lives. They were there to play leadership roles in helping incarcerated individuals find their way in their post-prison lives.
The most powerful moments with these men were the leadership they displayed in that room. They spoke with candor, vulnerability, and depth. Their very presence in the conference room was a lesson in Everyday Leadership. We saw the leadership of Sidney Davis, who sits at the center of this collection of men, many of whom he has known for much of his life. We learned of the leadership of Dr. Ron Garrett, a Returning Citizen who now serves as the Director of Reentry Health Services and Supports at Mettle-Works Behavioral Health. We heard the story of Alexander Campbell, a Peer Support Specialist who helps Returning Citizens with jobs, job training, coaching, and internal development.
And there was Tank. All of these men’s stories were memorable, but Tank left a special impression on me. As I engaged with these citizens over the course of the first day, Tank was quiet. He was clearly engaged, but his voice had been absent. Toward the end of the day, I began to talk about leadership being about connecting with the people around you. I talked about vulnerability and sharing, allowing the people around you to hear your voice. At one point, I looked at Tank, and said, “Tank, we haven’t heard much from you today. I know the other men in this room know you, but I do not. I would love to hear your thoughts. I would love to hear you voice and hear a little bit about the thoughts that move you.” Tank looked at me for a long silent minute. Then he began to speak. He talked about leadership. He talked about spending six years on death row and three years in solitary confinement. He talked about the long hours he spent alone imaging who he would be as a leader when he emerged from that darkness.
At one point, he began to cry, and his trickle of tears became weeping. The room sat silently listening. I was in awe of this man’s courage, his vulnerability, his sharing of his story and feelings. After the session ended, I wanted to thank Tank for his vulnerability, for his courage. He cut me off: “No Professor.Ishould be thankingyou. You pushed me where I needed to go. And you helped me see that being vulnerable takes courage. Vulnerability and the courage to share is leadership. Thank you for pushing me there.”
I was moved by his words. Everyday Leadership, right there, standing in front of me.
Postscript: At the moment I was writing the above paragraphs about Tank, I received a call from Dan. Two days earlier, Tank had died suddenly of natural causes. Moved to tears by this sad news, I felt so thankful for the opportunity to have known Tank for those short two days. This sharing of Everyday Leadership teaching and learning experiences is now dedicated to him. Thank you, Tank, for your vulnerability, your courage, your leadership.
