### Behind Every Global Tension: A Personal Take on Geopolitics

29 March 2023|China, China history, Taiwan
AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy and, in particular, life in China. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. In this post, OGL’s Doug Guthrie reflects on a moment that reminds us just how personal global tensions can be. We have written about the personal experiences of everyday leadership in the midst of global tensions (see, e.g., our piece everyday leadership in Ukrainehereandhere) and in the midst of the COVID-19 crisis (see, e.g.,here). In this post, we look at the tensions around Taiwan. We have written previously about the Taiwan question, its history and how the future of this island affects US-China relations (see, e.g.,hereandhere). But here we write about the ways in which this issue hits some citizens deeply.
A couple of weeks ago, I traveled to Japan with a group of Thunderbird Executive Management students so they could experience the dynamics of doing business in important markets with different cultures and institutional environments. For me, this particular trip had a special allure. Although I am not a Japan specialist, I have spent much of my adult life studying and living in Asia (China and Taiwan), and this was my first trip to Asia since the pandemic began. Even though Japan is very different from China, it felt like a bit of a homecoming for me.
That week, our Tokyo hotel seemed to be filled with Taiwanese tourists. As a Mandarin speaker, it was a treat to be walking through the lobby listening to tourists conducting their business in my beloved Mandarin. At times, I couldn’t resist jumping into conversations, deploying my language skills to ask a family, “Where in Taiwan are you from?” One morning, as I was heading down to the bus to meet our student group, I found myself in one of these conversations on the elevator. It went something like this:
“Hi. How are you? Where in Taiwan are you from?”
“How do you speak Chinese?”
“Well, I studied Chinese for many years.”
“How did you know we are from Taiwan?”
“I could tell by your accent. I studied in Taipei many years ago.”
“Oh, my goodness. We must exchange cards. You should come visit us next time you are in Taiwan.”
This type of banter is fairly common, but then the conversation took a surprising turn. As we were getting off the elevator, the 63-year-old woman, somewhat sternly, said to her daughter, “Go wait for me in the lobby.” Then she turned to me, saying in a more serious tone, “I need to talk to you.” She grabbed my arm and pulled me to a private space at the end of the elevator bank.
Ms. Chen (speaking urgently): “You have to help us.”
Me: “Um. OK. How can I help you?”
Ms. Chen: “Well, you are a friend of Taiwan; you love Taiwan. You even said you loved living there and you have many friends.”
Me: “But how can I help you?”
At this point her voice was wavering and a tear began to trickle down her cheek. I didn’t know what was happening or what to do next.
Ms. Chen: “You must help save us. You must help people in America understand. We are going to be eaten alive by the dragon. We are Chinese, but we are also Taiwanese. We are independent. You have to help people understand. We need your help.”
At this point, I put my hand on her shoulder and Ms. Chen put her head on my shoulder and began to cry. I said, “I will do everything I can. But I am a small person, I cannot do much. But we are all doing everything we can.”
These issues are complex, and we won’t go deeply into them here. Suffice it to say, there is a long and complicated history  about Taiwan being a part of China. This historical narrative includes two Sino-Japanese wars, the battle between the Communists (CCP/CPC) and the Nationalists (KMT), the Nationalists settling on the island province, Taiwan holding  China’s UN Security Council seat, former President Nixon’s visit to China, the Shanghai Joint Communique, in which it was affirmed that Taiwan is part of China, and many others.
This is more than history, though. These moments are all the more fraught today given that former Taiwan President Ma Ying-jeou, who has become the first sitting or former Taiwanese leader to visit mainland China since the Communist revolution in 1949, boldly declared in Beijing, "We are all Chinese." Meanwhile, current President Tsai Ing-wen is visiting the United States for private meetings, although she is scheduled to meet with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy on April 5. China has threatened retaliation if she does: ”Those who play with fire will perish by it,” warned Xu Xueyuan, the chargés d’affaires in the Chinese embassy in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday.
Due to these tensions, we are now in a position in which Mainland China fundamentally believes that there isonly one China(the so-called One China Policy), and Taiwan is a part of that national body. However, it is also the case, that Taiwan has evolved independently over the lastseventy years– both culturally and institutionally – and many people there believe, as Ms. Chen does, that Taiwan deserves a chance to survive and thrive independently.
We will not take a position on this issue. Our goal is to analyze issues like this one in a deep and nuanced fashion. However, it is also important for us to remind ourselves and our readers that there are people behind the geopolitics and global tensions. They are people with feelings: fear and anguish and pain. They are people who need the world to listen to them.
So, Ms. Chen, we are listening, and we heard you. Thank you.
