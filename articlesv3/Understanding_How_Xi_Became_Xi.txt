### Understanding How Xi Became Xi

Having spent a week inChinarecently, I thought it would be a good time to assess where things are  today, especially since this was my first trip to China since the 18th  Party Congress and the official ascension ofXi Jinping.
Let’s be clear, although I am often accused of being a Pollyannaish  supporter of the Beijing regime (some bloggers have speculated as to  whether I am actually on Beijing’s payroll), from a political and economic standpoint, the last decade in China has not been a good one.
With that in mind, it's an interesting time to consider the decade ofHu JintaoandWen Jiabao’s  regime. However, in order to do so, I need to first reflect on Zhu  Rongji. I have always been a fan of Zhu Rongji. I think, more than any  other leader, Zhu is responsible for where China is today. Of course Deng Xiaoping set China on its current path, and Zhao Ziyang was a key  person in pushing forward the export-oriented economy. But it was really  Zhu Rongji in the 1990s and early 2000s that built the economic engine  that is China today.
There is a great deal to say about this (and I have written about the topic extensively in my bookChina and Globalization),  but suffice it to say that Zhu Rongji took on many of the difficult  issues of the reform era – from state-owned-enterprise (SOE) reform to  the building of the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration  Commission (SASAC) to the passage of many laws that helped set China on  the path toward a rule-of-law economy and society.
By comparison, the decade under Hu Jintao and Wen Jiabao has  been a disaster. Perhaps calling it a disaster seems a little extreme, as the country did average about 8 percent growth during that decade and  weathered the global financial crisis better than most countries. But a  disaster it was.
Actually, the weakness of the Hu-Wen regime was initially a little  difficult to see, precisely because so many of the policies that Zhu had  set in motion carried forward with a momentum of their own. Yet by the  mid-2000s, it became clear that China was sliding. These leaders just  did not have the economic chops or political clout to continue what Zhu  and Jiang had started. There was a retrenchment of the SOE model in a  number of different sectors (This is not the new-phase SOE model under  SASAC, but rather a retrenchment of the old-school models of economic  behavior.) And the Hu-Wen regime couldn't stop it because it didn’t have  the clout with the provinces.
Then there was the dramatic rise in corruption over the decade. Zhu  had not solved the corruption problem, but things were definitely moving  in the right direction. By the early 2000s, many Chinese executives would bristle at the talk of corruption and back-door practices. The  culture was definitely shifting. Today, we seem to be back in the  mid-1990s, and I’m not just talking about the high-profile cases of Bo  Xilai and the like. I am talking about the ways in which corruption in  middle management has worked itself back into the expectations of how  you progress in your career.
One U.S.-educated Chinese lawyer I met with agreed with this  sentiment. As he put it, “When I came back here in 2002, I was surprised  by how much better things seemed in this area. It was much different  than when I left [in the mid-1990s]. But, then over the course of the  last 10 years, it just seems like corruption has reemerged. It’s  everywhere today. When I deal with cases today, people just tell me  which judges have been bought, how the cases are going to play out, and  what we are eligible for behind the scenes. We always turn them down,  but the offers are always out there. It’s amazing how far backwards we  have gone in the last 10 years.”
Which brings us to Xi Jinping andLi Keqiang.  Xi stayed far below the radar screen in the months leading up to his  appointment. I thought this was just because he was another blank slate  like Hu before him. But I think the reality is far more different and  savvy. He was waiting until the moment of his ascension, not wanting to  risk anything before he was actually in a position of power. Now he has come out of the gates looking strong and determined. There are subtle  signs that point to this.
As practiced in the United States, the China policy field has the  feel of a tealeaves reading. What did the use of this phrase mean? What  did it mean that this politician was or was not evoked in a speech? I  don’t want to delve too deeply into that line of analysis, but some  things are worth noting here. For example, in his first official speech  to the nation, Xi went off script. He did not read the standard canned  speech that is so common at an event like this. Instead, he spoke in  broad brushstrokes about the things that are important to China in the  coming years. He was direct about further liberalization, containing  corruption and supporting the rule of law.
It was not a speech that could be described with the euphemistic term  “xu-yen” (best translated as “empty words”). Further, Xi’s initial actions and positioning supports this view. He has been outspoken on  corruption; he has gained control of the military (a feat that Hu did  not accomplish until two years into his tenure); and he has invoked the  memory of Deng Xiaoping with a Southern Tour resembling the one that  Deng took in 1992. The signs are there: Xi is going to be reform  oriented. He is going to push the country to resume the path that Zhu  Rongji set, and he is going to be in control.
Many of the business leaders I spoke with in Shanghai, Beijing and  Hong Kong confirmed these views time and again. One very senior business  leader noted, “I feel that things have been so uncertain for the last  five or six years. And now since the 18th Party Congress, for the first  time, I really feel a little optimistic. I think Xi is going to get us  back on track. Many of my business associates feel the same.”
We will see what Xi Jinping and Li Keqiang can to do rein in  corruption, restart SOE reform and advance the further liberalization of  the economy. But I am certainly more optimistic today than I was two  months ago. For better or worse, China needs another strongman, and it  looks like Xi Jinping is going to be it.
