### President Biden: Please Bring Some Sanity to U.S.-China Trade War

22 July 2022|China, Trade, US-China Relations
AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy and, in particular, life in China. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. We have also written about thehistoryandcurrent stateof U.S.-China relations. Recently, we have written about the 50th anniversary ofPresident Nixon's visit to Chinaand how U.S.-China relations have evolved over that period (e.g.,here,here, andhere). In this post, we return to these issues with some advice for President Biden and the Trade War, which began under President Trump.
President Biden is expected to soon consider lifting the tariffs on goods imported from China, which were the result of the Trade War that was started under President Trump. On the campaign trail, Biden promised that he would rethink the relationship with China, including considering a roll back of the Trump trade  tariffs. Biden has been disappointingly slow in setting U.S.-China relations back onto a better, more collaborative road.
To be very clear, the Trump-era policies and rhetoric vis-à-vis China were a disaster. Trump’s focus on tariffs was a loser from the start. Tariffs do nothing but hurt American consumers and their pocketbooks. Period. Full stop. Tariffs are a tax on U.S. consumers. (The vast majority ofgoodeconomists agree on this.)
Tariffs are sold to the public as a tax on Chinese companies and, therefore, a tax on China. The core idea here is to make Chinese goods more expensive in an effort to re-balance trade – the U.S. trade deficit with China is in the $300 billion range, i.e., China exports about $300 billion more to the U.S. than it imports from the U.S. Thus, if Chinese goods are rendered more expensive through a tariff, people will buy U.S. goods over Chinese goods, which will in turn create American jobs and boost the U.S. economy.
The problem here is that this political and economic approach reflects a simplistic and ineffective understanding of the global economy and U.S.-China trade relations. Frankly, it is just bunk. Bizarrely, this entire approach to the trade imbalance has mostly ended up hurting U.S. consumers and thus hurting the U.S. economy in the long run.
How does it really work? Today, Walmart is the single largest China exporter globally, and Apple, Tesla, and several other U.S. companies dominate the list. By category, textiles and shoes are the top, then computers and computer components, then cell phones. For two companies, Walmart and Apple, the vast majority of their products are produced and assembled in China, and their largest market in the world is the United States.
Apple may be a U.S. company, but because its iPhones are assembled in China, they enter the United States as a Chinese export and are subject to the Trump-era tariffs. The U.S. Department of Treasury collects the extra "tax" on the Chinese exported goods, immediately making those goods more expensive than U.S. versions. But the reality is that most consumers don't switch to the cheaper brand.
If you are an iPhone owner or a Walmart shopper, you remain loyal to the products you know, and so you will pay the higher price. In essence, U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods end up being a tax on U.S. consumers – a transfer of wealth from the American consumer to the U.S. government. There is no economic logic here, only political grandstanding.
Trump and his (reckless) trade czar, Peter Navarro, argued these higher prices would force companies to bring manufacturing jobs back to America. This argument shows a ridiculous lack of understanding of how manufacturing supply chains work, particularly those in China. There have been a few discussions of bringing some manufacturing back to the U.S., but the reverse flow has been more symbolic.
Casual observers believe China has too much of an advantage with its deep, cheap labor pool. And, indeed, China does have an advantage there with a migrant labor force – the so-called “floating population” – of about 300 million people. But this is only part of the story.
What makes the Chinese manufacturing supply chain so powerful is that, for the last four decades, local officials have built localized industrial clusters that specialize in different types of products. Many outside observers superficially surmise that China technology manufacturer Foxconn builds Apple’s phones when really it is only an assembler.
Apple works with more than 1,000 suppliers in China developing components, modules, and final assembly sites. The idea that a tax in the form of a tariff would lead Apple to move all of its production to the United States is just silly. Instead what we have is a pattern where excessive tariffs have become a tax on the consumer in the form of higher prices. Good one guys.
Biden said in May he was considering rolling back some of the hundreds of billions of dollars in Trump tariffs on Chinese goods. In early July, tariffs were the subject of a meeting between senior U.S. and Chinese officials as a response to out-of-control inflation globally.
Easing these “taxes” on U.S. consumers would lower the costs of everyday purchases, whether diapers, furniture, or technology, at a time when inflation is overwhelming Americans. So, President Biden, please be smart: remove the tariffs, end the trade war, and return to a full-bodied engagement model for U.S.-China relations. It’s a win-win-win scenario.
