### What Trump Meant (and What Biden Will Mean) to US-China Relations

13 November 2020|China, China politics, Geopolitics
AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy and, in particular, life in China. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. We have sought to advance a conversation about theU.S.-China relationship, and a deep understanding of local economic development in China. We have also written about theU.S.-China Trade Waras it relates China’s role in the global economy. With the recent election of President-Elect Joe Biden and Vice President-Elect Kamala Harris, in this post, we present a retrospective on the past four years with some predictions about the four years to come for the U.S.-China relationship. – The Editorial Team

On November 13, nearly a week after Joe Biden and Kamala Harris had been declared President-Elect and Vice President-Elect of the United States, the People's Republic of China belatedly congratulated the new president. The Chinese foreign ministry, days after other regional powers had spoken with Biden, acknowledged it would  "respect the choice of the American people".

That China took so long to acknowledge Biden's victory might reflect how rocky U.S.-China relations have been in the last year. In fact, the tensions that emerged in the four years after the election of President Trump will likely prove a sharp contrast to how that relationship might change with a Biden-Harris Administration.
Leaving aside the current chaos in the transition period, we argue the following:
(1) The Trump Administration has done significant damage to the relationship between the United States and China, the world’s second largest economy and the United States’ largest trading partner.
(2) The new administration will face political pressure to be tough on some issues, but overall a Biden Administration will be guided by more of an engagement-oriented approach to dealing with China, and that will be a positive thing. In addition to watching the behavior of President Trump and his administration, there are some additional data points that can help guide our analysis: as the vice president under President Obama, President-Elect Biden has eight years of executive experience in guiding U.S.-China relations; four of those years were in direct dialogue with President Xi Jinping’s administration.
And (3) all that being said, to the Chinese government and Chinese citizens, none of this might matter, as China may already be heading down a different path, one of self-sufficiency, which will increasingly lead to them ignoring the United States.
Offensive Diplomacy and a Power Vacuum Under President Trump
On October 31, 2020, a few days before the U.S. presidential election, CNN’s Ben Westcott wrote about how President Xi Jinping “missed a golden opportunity with US President Donald Trump.” The article is deeply flawed. It basically places the blame of the souring of U.S.-China relations on China. As Westcott puts it, the “outstanding relationship,” to use Trump’s words, “is a distant memory… As Trump battles for reelection in November’s presidential election, experts now say that Xi may have missed a golden opportunity to establish a more beneficial relationship with the U.S. President.” At the very least, this is an absurd comment, as it places the starting point of the Trump-Xi relations on a photo-op dinner at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago Resort. Despite the sense of decorum in that meeting, we need to remember that the newly elected Trump’s attitude toward China was tied to a long history of China-bashing rhetoric.
Before getting into the contrast of Trump and Biden, let’s begin by looking for a moment at what China is trying to accomplish right now. Beginning with Deng Xiaoping’s leadership, all leaders of the last forty years of China’s economic reforms have been pragmatically focused on bringing China back to life after the tragic chaos of the Mao years and the “Century of Humiliation” (百年耻辱) at the hands of the West and Japan. Many people in China, regardless of education levels, can cite the offenses or the First Opium War, the Second Opium War, the Sino-Japanese War, the Boxer Rebellion, and the Rape of Nanjing. For Chinese leaders and citizens, Chinese sovereignty and control has become a paramount issue. Even today, China’s leadership often reminds Chinese citizens of the Century of Humiliation. Today, the Chinese leadership views sovereignty and respect as being among the most important dignities in China today. Other issues are viewed as transactional, business-oriented, and simply a part of China’s next phase of development.
In the wake of the Century-of-Humiliation tragedies, China’s Reform Era leaders have been oriented toward economic development, poverty alleviation, technological advancement, and self-sufficiency. They have focused on carefully guiding the country through the complex transitions from export-led growth to investment-led growth to consumption-led growth. Xi has forged a path that diverges from his predecessors of the Reform Era in significant ways, as he has plans that extend beyond economic development and poverty alleviation, technological advancement, and the transition to consumption-led growth. Xi aspires for China to reclaim a position as one of the, if not the, most powerful and influential nations on the planet, and also to be more self-reliant. During Xi’s tenure, China will become the largest economy in the world, and it’s likely to play a major role in economic development for poorer nations and containing global climate change.
In his CNN article, Westcott does cite the views of several prominent China pundits (most of them hawks). And he cites a number of instances – from China’s conflicts with Australia to a renewed conflict with India – as well as Pew opinion data about declining public attitudes toward China. However, there are two major problems here: First, U.S. foreign and domestic policies are equally if not more to blame for the rift in U.S.-China relationships right now. When the U.S. has been a stable diplomatic partner on the global stage, it has been able to engage with partners like China in ways that lead to predictable outcomes. Recently, the U.S. has been erratic, disrespectful, and even incompetent, and this has created a vacuum in the geopolitical landscape. It is true that U.S. public opinion about China has dropped precipitously in the last four years, but global public opinion of the United States has fallen even more dramatically.
Moreover, it is not clear whether China evenwantsto have strong relations with the likes of Australia and India, among others. The entireBelt and Road Initiative (BRI), which we have written about previously and which we have referred to as China’s Marshall Plan, is set up to make China the leader of the developing world, the so-called “Global South.” China’s focus is on Southeast Asia, Africa, parts of the Middle East and Eurasia. (There is a phrase that is often uttered in China, “south-south cooperation” [ 南南合作]). While it is certainly true that China’s relationship with the United States has cooled significantly over the last four years, it is certainly not all China’s fault. Worse for us, China might not even care.
Trump Incompetence
In a number of decisions regarding China policy, the Trump Administration comes across as simply incompetent. Take, for example, the trade war and tariffs. You cannot find a credible economist who will agree with the administration that the tariffs are (a) good for American consumers and (b) will make any headway on bringing jobs back to America. Here is the real deal on tariffs: tariffs are not paid by China; they are paid by the companies that are transporting goods from China to the United States. This tax goes to the U.S. Treasury. Among the largest exporters from China to the United States are companies such as Walmart and Apple (Walmart is #1). In the logic of shareholder capitalism, publicly traded companies are loath to allow this tax to cut into profits, so the vast majority of this tax is passed onto U.S. consumers. So, in the case of Walmart, which has a customer base that is largely lower- and middle-income consumers, what you have here is a transfer of wealth from Walmart’s consumers to the U.S. Treasury.
Further, in our advisory work with U.S. companies, not a single one we have worked with has confirmed that they are moving manufacturing back to the United States as a result of the tariffs. Perhaps moving manufacturing to Vietnam or Malaysia, but no one is talking seriously about relocating manufacturing jobs from China to America as a result of the tariffs. This is simply not how global supply chains work. The fact that Trump and Navarro think that tariffs will compel companies like Apple and Foxconn to simply build final assembly factories in the United States reveals a deep misunderstanding of how flexible supply chains in China specifically and Asia more generally are structured.
Another example of ineptitude is the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). One of the first tough-on-China actions of the Trump Administration was to withdraw the United States from the TPP, an order which he signed three days after taking office. The administration’s argument was that it was following through on a campaign promise to be tougher on China. The only problem is that the entire logic of the TPP was to pull together a coalition of nations that would be acounterbalanceto China and its growing role in the region. So, the U.S. pulled out of the TPP and left a power vacuum in the one multilateral Pacific agreement that was set to contain China.
Respect and Diplomacy
It is also important to touch on global diplomacy and respect. Over the last four years, the U.S. treatment of China has been disrespectful. Having Peter Navarro as a central figure in U.S.-China trade discussions has been an astounding decision. The idea that we would have as a lead negotiator with our largest trading partner a person who has written an extremely xenophobic and sensationalistic book about China – a book that is rife with inaccuracies and unsubstantiated accusations – indicates that the Trump Administration has had little interest in respectful diplomatic talks with the world’s soon-to-be largest economy. Respect and “face” matter in Chinese diplomatic relations and placing an incendiary pundit like Navarro in a lead position here sent a very clear message to China that the U.S. had little interest in working together in pursuing positive shared outcomes.
The outcome has been growing tensions over trade and diplomacy, and a lack interest in building a true partnership with the world’s most populous nation. These lapses have come to define U.S.-China relations in the Era of Donald Trump.
Let’s analyze President-Elect Biden in parallel to the missteps of the Trump Administration. At the highest level, we predict that the transformation of U.S.-China Relations will unfold under the following cadence: (1) In the first half of 2021, the Biden Administration is going to be focused on righting the ship on the COVID-19 pandemic and the pandemic’s impact on the U.S. economy. U.S.-China relations are not going to be a priority. But China is a critical partner with the U.S. economy, so we will need to re-engage; that will begin in the summer of 2021. And that will require us thinking about tariffs, engagement, multilateralism, and diplomacy, all with respect to China, the largest population in the world and the soon-to-be largest economy in the world.
So, let’s go a little deeper on each of these points. First, the initial question we raised above still stands: does China even care at this point? We have long argued that China has many advantages in a trade war with the United States, and we do not believe the U.S. can come out of this game of chicken victorious, as the Trump-Navarro-Robert Lighthizer team think it will. China’s manufacturing supply chain is simply too sophisticated, and the government spends far more time than the U.S. in thinking about how to maintain these advantages. China wins the Trump Trade War, tariffs or no. And, as we discussed above, China may already be pivoting toward self-sufficiency, self-reliance, and playing a leading role in developing the “Global South” through the Belt and Road Initiative.
Tariffs and Engagement
With regard to tariffs and the Trade War, the Biden Administration will feel pressure – particularly from the left and organized labor – to continue a tough-on-China trade policy. As we have argued above, tariffs are a simplistic and illogical way to pursue the goals of reducing the trade deficit or rebuilding manufacturing in America. After decades of careful planning on the building of a sophisticated, dynamic, integrated supply chain, simply raising costs through tariffs will not force companies to leave China and return manufacturing to the United States. As we have argued previously, the benefits of manufacturing in China include a deep cheap labor force (the so-called “floating population”) but also very careful strategic planning by local governments in how to buildniche markets in the manufacturing supply chain.
That being said, as U.S. citizens have been subject to decades of facile arguments on these issues (especially over the last four years), the idea that tariffs are a powerful lever in dealing with the trade imbalance has become a pillar of U.S.-China trade rhetoric. President Biden will not be able to simply wipe four years of rhetoric under Trump away. However, Bidenwillhave smarter trade negotiators than Navarro and Lighthizer. We expect a reset on trade negotiations, but not an immediate abandonment of tariffs.
As a good-faith compromise position, we expect the new administration to move back to the Phase 1 agreements of the Trump Trade War, with a goal of re-opening negotiations over Chinese imports of U.S. goods. The U.S. is going to want more purchasing of U.S. farm goods; China is going to want a relaxation on restrictions of U.S. technical goods (e.g., semiconductors). Also, from the Chinese side, keep an eye out forHuawei,Tencent (WeChat), Alibaba, andBytedance (TikTok)being a part of these conversations. From the U.S. side, keep an eye out for Google, Facebook, and Twitter being a part of the conversation. The bottom line on the tariffs/trade war: the issue will not go away immediately, but we expect that a Biden Administration will approach this issue in a more intelligent and engagement-oriented way.
Multilateralism, Respect and Diplomacy
With respect to multilateralism, Biden has a long history of championing policies that think carefully about how to bring together multilateral institutions with a policy of engagement in dealing with China. In 2011, under the Obama Administration, the TPP was set up to be a multilateral counterbalance to China and China’s influence in ASEAN. The main point is that Biden has a long resume of balancing multilateral partnerships and institutions with direct engagement. This is a much more sophisticated approach to foreign policy than the current administration exhibits.
As a long-serving member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and with eight years as vice president, Biden has a good deal of experience in foreign affairs and a long history of multilateralism. As senator and vice president, Biden was a politician who took multilateralism seriously and conducted political affairs in a respectful and diplomatic manner. These two facts alone will make a significant difference in the tone and partnerships that will come to re-define U.S.-China relations in the years to come. While it is likely Biden will be firm with respect to certain aspects of China policy domestically and in the region, it is also very likely that the tone will be much different – more respectful and diplomatic.
Sensitive Issues
Biden will also be under pressure from various groups and sectors of U.S. society to not ignore sensitive issues such as Hong Kong and Taiwan. More importantly, there will be pressure to respond forthrightly to the repression of the Uyghur ethnic minority in Xinjiang. These are difficult issues, and Chinese leaders have strong views on its sovereignty over affairs that they view as Chinese internal affairs. However, here again, we expect that a more diplomatic and engagement-oriented approach to negotiations on all fronts will have a better chance of advancing conversation than Trumpian bravado.
In the main, with regard to U.S.-China relations, we believe the Biden Administration has the potential to engage in a reset in the relationship between the world’s two largest economies. We expect that the tariff discussions will be rolled back. We expect a multilateral re-engagement around the themes that emerged in the Obama-Biden “Pivot to Asia.” It would be very difficult for the United States to re-engage with the TPP, as that organization has changed significantly in the four years since the U.S. withdrawal. But Biden has such a long history of focusing on multilateral engagement and institutions, it is difficult to imagine that this would not be a core feature of U.S.-China relations in the years to come.
There will be much rebuilding to do, but Biden also has a long history of respectful diplomacy, which should help the dynamics between the two nations. Two wild cards remain: (1) How much pressure will a President Biden experience to maintain tariffs and a tough-on-China stance under the illusion that tariffs will somehow restart manufacturing in America. And (2) given the damage that has been done to U.S.-China relations over the last four years and given China’s current drive toward self-reliance and South-South relations, will China even care what Biden might want to do regarding engagement? The answers to these questions remain to be seen.
