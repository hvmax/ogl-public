### Where Customer Service meets Everyday Leadership

1 December 2021|Creative Leadership, Everyday Leadership, Leadership
AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. Several of us have advised companies and taught about leadership over theyears, and we have developed atheoryof leadership that takes us away from the big personality or charismatic leader to the person on the ground fighting for his or her team, community, or family. In this post, we seek to continue our advancement of a view of everyday leadership in this day and age. – The Editorial Team

The Inn at Little Washington, Virginia, USA
The Inn at Little Washington is known for its luxurious service, almost as much as its three-star Michelin cuisine. The hotel and restaurant are designed to surprise, setting the stage for  unforgettable sights, sounds and tastes, as well as a seamless experience of personal care.
The owner and chef is Patrick O’Connell, known affectionately as the “pope” of American cuisine, and he has created a renowned restaurant in a tiny village 90 miles southwest of Washington, D.C. The Inn’s flair and personality reflect his own, and his almost military allegiance to lavish customer service.
While the food has been called the “heartbeat” of the experience, and it definitely leaves the heart aflutter, the enthusiasm and service of the staff gives the Inn its unmistakable atmosphere of sophisticated elegance and distinctiveness in the gentle foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains. From the waiters to the concierges to the pastry chef, the Inn is populated by a team of steadfast souls who have ownership and agency in their work.
When we discuss Everyday Leadership in this blog, we often focus on the qualities of individuals who may not shine as brightly as their polished and flamboyant leaders but who still make important contributions that ensure the success of the organization. Such is the case with the staff at the Inn.
A recent visit showed the value of customer service but also the importance of giving staff a chance to lead their own contributions and to distinguish themselves with guests. Reading the mood of the guests, a server might choose to pour an extra measure of wine or provide a late-night tour of the famous kitchen.
Yes, this qualifies as superior customer service. It also qualifies as strategic leadership on the individual level where a server, concierge or a footman can decide the fate of a request or wish, or go the extra step to ensure a positive outcome. Since the experience there is of aprix fixenature, little is connected to direct tipping.
Time and again, the staff both at the Inn and its corresponding shops reached for that next level of service, looking for solutions to problems or finding opportunities to enhance the experience of guests. These came in both small and larger acts, always without expectation and often surprising.
At On Global Leadership, these small and large acts reflect an intense creativity in the face of a host of disparate challenges. The staff was exhibiting both intuition and institution, which was embodied by its training. There is value that comes from a deep understanding of people and always trusting your intuition, both habits of creative leaders.
Certainly, the staff is paid well for its service compared to the surrounding area, which is mountain rural. Many of them stay for years, even decades, while others go on to new careers and adventures. It’s also not uncommon to find a family tree of brothers, sisters and cousins working together at the Inn.
The quality of the service comes from the individual employee. It also comes from a dedication to teamwork. While every individual can and does shine, the team is at the forefront of the service. By working together powerfully and effortlessly, the Inn’s staff was able to provide a level of attention that resulted in personal achievement and organizational success.
One of the more memorable members of the staff, the tea master Cameron, who also serves a remarkable cheese plate, is known for his encyclopedic knowledge, silly puns and impish giggle. (Also, it doesn’t hurt to be pushing a plastic cow on wheels around the dining room with a bell and a cheese tray on top.) As is the case with any terrific server, or everyday leader, Cameron had found his place on the team yet was able to differentiate himself among his colleagues and with guests.
Without a doubt, the Inn’s staff is highly trained and expertly managed. The place would fail without its commitment to training and customer service. Yet that doesn’t take away from the personal leadership and creativity required of the individual staff members who hold in their hands both the experience of the guests and the fate of the Inn.
