### Everyday Leadership: The Case of Amy Guthrie

2 September 2021|Everyday Leadership
AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. Several of us have advised companies and taught about leadership over theyears, and we have developed atheoryof leadership that takes us away from the charismatic leader to the person on the ground fighting for theteam, community,family, or evenyoung adolescent leaders. In this post, we seek to continue our advancement of a view of everyday leadership. – The Editorial Team

I raised four children. Amy Guthrie is the oldest. When my children were growing up, she was the quiet one, read a lot, was really cooperative, and not at all competitive. She loved French, working backstage on theater productions, and did well in school. Amy went to a Quaker college, again worked on theater productions, and had a double major—peace and global studies and French. Who writes a senior thesis in French on the separatist movement in Quebec for a college in Indiana?
When she graduated, she went on to get a master’s degree in education, taught school, and then got married. Eventually, she and her husband, Ray, had a baby. Their child, Ben, was born with Down syndrome. I remember an early conversation with Amy, walking through Pittsburgh’s Frick Park, in which she talked about needing to come up with different dreams. When you have a baby, you often map your future onto dream templates that you know: early childhood achievements, high school graduation, college graduation, marriage, grandchildren. But, in that moment, Amy was already thinking about new dreams, a different template for an unknown future.
Our quiet child took on this challenge with the greatest determination possible. Ben had interventions by the time he was 3 months. He started school as early as possible. They moved to the city so that he could go to kindergarten and have access to an aide. Amy was basically going to school twice. For every year that Ben was in public school, she dived into the curriculum with him so she could reinforce at home what he was learning in school.
Ben has always been interested in music, so she signed him up for music lessons at a local academy, where he got to play in a community orchestra. In the percussion section, there was one young man with Tourette Syndrome, one on the autism spectrum, and Ben. They played serious music. Ben got to play the anvil in the “Anvil Chorus.” He played the bass drum, the bell lyre, and the tympani drum. This, of course, meant that Amy was with him for every practice, drum lesson, and concert. She helped him practice at home, learning each piece of music as much as he did.
Ben played in the high school band, not an easy project for Amy, because the director didn’t  want someone with special needs in his band. Amy fought like a tiger for him to stay in the band, and was the most faithful band parent any director could ever dream of. She was there for every special practice, parade, football game, city-wide festival, and car wash. She helped get the plumes on the hats, passed out water to the kids, even carried the banner at the beginning of the parade if there weren’t enough kids there.
Ben took French and physics along with the usual courses. She said he might not get all of the concepts in physics, but he could understand gravity. She speaks French with him at home, has taken him to France three times, and encourages his interest in Notre Dame. She has helped him to be involved in Special Olympics, social programs, and volunteering at the local botanical garden.
She has encouraged a local university to develop a college program for students with special needs, so he is now a student at that college. That means that Amy continues to go to school. Additionally, Ben is fascinated with the bagpipes, so he’s been taking lessons for several years. How many young adults with Down syndrome have played “Amazing Grace” at the graveside of a dear uncle?
Amy has leveraged all the knowledge she's built up with Ben to help others, a characteristic she shares with other Everyday Leaders. She works for a local agency as an advocate, helping parents of children with special needs get the help they need in school districts in the area. Amy knows how to work the system, knows the rights of students, and is tireless in assisting parents to get the help they need for their children. She also works with the self-advocacy program.
Amy's kind of leadership has been built and sustained through everyday action because life insisted on her full participation. Everyday Leadership's goal isn’t the creation of effective leaders alone, it is the creation of successful links between real life and far-sighted, humble, and creative leaders of their own lives, families, companies, and organizations.
You never know what a person is capable of until she’s given the challenge. It's a given she's an amazing mother like parents of most special needs children. Will life’s circumstances defeat her or will she soar and become the best advocate in her community? For me, it’s pretty clear which path Amy has chosen.
An additional note from OGL’s Doug Guthrie (Amy’s brother).
As I have described in other posts, I often teach Everyday Leadership with an opening exercise, asking students to identify the leader they most admire in the world. The typical list that comes back is pretty predictable – Oprah Winfrey, Elon Musk, Kamala Harris, and Martin Luther King, Jr. I always follow up by asking students: “Why do our most admired leaders always seem to involve people at the top of some very high mountain. What about your mom, your dad, or a high school English teacher?” In my own life, I think my sister is one of the greatest leaders I know. For Everyday Leadership, don’t forget about the people around you. Everyone, every day, a leader.
