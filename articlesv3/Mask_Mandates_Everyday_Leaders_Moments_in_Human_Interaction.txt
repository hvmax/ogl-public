### Mask Mandates & Everyday Leaders: Moments in Human Interaction

AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy. Several of us have advised companies and taught about leadership over theyears, and we have developed atheoryof leadership that takes us away from the charismatic leader to the person on the ground fighting for theteam, community,family, or evenyoung adolescent leaders. We have also written a significant amount abouteveryday leadershipandcreative leadership. In this post, we seek to continue our advancement of a view of Everyday Leadership from a personal perspective with a new piece by OGL CEO Doug Guthrie. – The Editorial Team
Humans are social beings. We interact. We engage. We even choose to self-isolate and ignore. In our theory of Everyday Leadership, we believe that leadership is not about some hallowed position that has deigned you a leader; instead, it is about leading in life, leading every day, regardless of the position you are in — in your organization, on your team, in your family, in your community. Everyone, every day, a leader.
We rarely write about ourselves when we talk about Everyday Leadership. We like to feature the stories of everyday leaders in everyday situations. In this case, I want to write about a mask moment that occurred an airport recently. This is not a post intended as self-aggrandizement or virtue signaling; rather it is a post meant to reflect on how people look to each other in our social worlds.
Preparing for my flight, I read the news about the chaos in airports with the new no-mask decision by the CDC. I thought about what I would do, and my decision was that I would wear a mask, as I simply believe that, for those who are still immunocompromised, they might need to see others supporting them.
When I arrived at the airport, few people were wearing masks. It seemed like a festive moment in which finally we had been liberated. In the security line, waiting to take my shoes off and put my laptop through the scanner, the passenger behind me said, “I am impressed you are wearing a mask.” I explained that I try to always wear a mask, as I want to set a good example for my kids (all are vaccinated but none have had boosters). She reached into her bag and got out a mask and put it on. She then said: “I felt self-conscious about wearing a mask because no one was wearing one. I thought people would be angry if I was wearing one. But you are wearing one, and now I feel like I can… I am a cancer patient. I am actually headed to a Chemo session in Houston right now. And my oncologist will be happy that I wore a mask on this fight. Thank you.”
We were going to different places, but we were on the same airport tram together. As our eyes met across the car – we were the only two people wearing masks in the car – she gave me the thumbs up (as my 5-year-old has learned to do in the mask-wearing era). She yelled, "you can’t see my face, but I am smiling. Thank you."
I tell this story to remind us that we are social beings, and we are all shaped by the social pressures and social dynamics around us. Everyday Leadership is about helping the people around us navigate these difficult social pressures and social moments. Leadership is not about the position you are in in a given corporation; it is about how you show up to life every single day. Everyone Every Day a Leader.
