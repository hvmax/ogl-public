### WeChat, TikTok, and the State of US-China Trade Relations

9 October 2020|China, Innovation
AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy and, in particular, life in China. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. We have sought to advance a conversation about the U.S.-China relationship, and a deep understanding of local economic development in China. We have written a series about the strategic strength oflocal economic development in China’s 2nd- and 3rd-tier citiesandentrepreneurship in China todayas well as a series aboutChina’s Belt and Road Initiative. More recently, we have been writing about the US-China Trade War as it relates toinnovation in the Chinese economy. This post adds to that conversation. – The OGL Editorial Team

Someday soon, the 330 million people in the world’s largest economy (United States) could have their access to the most convenient and increasingly most popular daily communications apps on the planet (WeChat and TikTok, respectively) blocked. Why? Because the companies that own these apps are headquartered in mainland China—the country that has become the bogeyman of every Trump administration trade nightmare.
Just to be clear, in China and in a growing proportion of the “Global South,” WeChat has achieved something truly dramatic: For a majority of users globally of mobile technology, WeChat isthede facto entry point to the Internet. And, with about 800 million users worldwide, TikTok is among the most popular apps in the world. It has more than 2 billion downloads on Apple’s App Store and Google Play combined.
Yet the Trump Administration seems deeply committed to the idea that Americans should not have access to these innovative social media applications. There are arguments about data mining in collusion with the Chinese Government, arguments that have been a centerpiece of excluding mega tech firm Huawei’s products from US markets. There are also whiffs of protectionism, as these Chinese applications surely pose a threat to major technology companies with parallel applications. And this, of course, is the looming backdrop for the US-China Trade War.
The Executive Orders
On August 6, 2020―lost among memorandums on COVID-19 relief, the use of National Guard to protect government assets, and nominations sent to the Senate―President Trump issued an executive order addressing “the threat caused by WeChat” and “the threat caused by TikTok.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Trump summarized these executive orders in the following way: “As I explained in an Executive Order of August 6, 2020, the spread in the United States of mobile applications developed and owned by companies in the People’s Republic of China continues to threaten the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. To protect our nation, I took action to address the threat posed by one mobile application, TikTok. Further action is needed to address a similar threat posed by another mobile application, WeChat.”
Where does this come from? Actually, the current administration is extending Executive Order 13873 that was issued more than a year earlier, on May 15, 2019 (Securing the Information and Communications Technology and Services Supply Chain). Apparently, the US is in need of protection as the president is basing this action on the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701et seq.) (IEEPA), the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601et seq.), and section 301 of Title 3, United States Code. That’s a lot of codes to throw at a social media app. What is happening to require such protections?
Many wondered what would happen on September 20, 2020. According to the August 6, 2020, executive order, “45 days after the date of this order, the Secretary (of Commerce Wilbur Ross) shall identify the transactions subject to subsection (a) of this section.” As the date approached, millions of WeChat users with relatives or colleagues in the US took to the communication tool, their questions flying to and fro. Millions of TikTok’s social media fans expressed their same concerns. Would we have WeChat and TikTok by the end of the day? And would it mean that an American with a WeChat account operating off a phone registered in Zambia to communicate with friends in China or the US be liable? Would they have committed a criminal act?
WeChat and TikTok users turned to their platforms to figure out what to do. Apple owners were advised that only upgrades would be blocked. This meant that nothing would change for WeChat users initially, but the lack of upgrades would render the app unusable over time. How about using someone else’s Apple ID to do the deed? Owners of Android phones were assured that since they can download the apps to their desktops, they don’t need to use the app store. Apple users were drawn a very different picture. Thoughts of the sudden wholesale offloading of Apple phones came to mind. For TikTok, the ban could block user access to the app on their phones, and certainly would force US app suppliers to take TikTok off their app stores.
Nearly two months after the executive orders, there was no further guidance on how to proceed and or even what it means. Like so many other executive orders or tariffs or speeches outlining new policy, Trump’s grand plan came to nothing. Not a peep as the clock ran out. What does it mean to put so much into bringing down these platforms without execution orders, clarity, or transparency?
In the case of TikTok, there was an executive reprieve from the White House, as a theoretical deal between Oracle, Walmart, and Bytedance (TikTok’s parent company) was announced. The reprieve for WeChat came from an U.S. judge who ruled that Trump’s executive order violated the First Amendment. There was no further word or actions from the US government.
What is really going on here? On Global Leadership’s editors would like to offer three lines of reasoning that might lend some insight to the dynamics at the heart of this standoff: the Cybersecurity Threat, the US-China Trade War, and the Protectionism Impact.
The cybersecurity threat. The Trump Administration’s argument is that applications like WeChat and TikTok pose a cybersecurity threat to US citizens and to the US government. As Trump articulated in the August executive order: “Like TikTok, WeChat automatically captures vast swaths of information from its users. This data collection threatens to allow the Chinese Communist Party access to Americans’ personal and proprietary information. In addition, the application captures the personal and proprietary information of Chinese nationals visiting the United States, thereby allowing the Chinese Communist Party a mechanism for keeping tabs on Chinese citizens who may be enjoying the benefits of a free society for the first time in their lives.” The US government has long made similar arguments about Huawei. As U.S. Sens. Marco Rubio and John Cornyn argued in their 2019 legislation, “Huawei poses a significant threat to U.S. economic and national security, as well as our critical infrastructure. This legislation makes it clear to the Chinese government and Communist Party that Huawei’s attempt to abuse American rule of law will not be tolerated.”
Frankly, we don’t buy this argument. The arguments about companies like Huawei, which Rubio and others have been making for over a decade, are simply specious. As we have argued in an earlierpost, “No one ever seems to mention that Huawei was the first Chinese vendor to use third-party verification through the well-respected Virginia-based Electronic Warfare Associates (EWA); that it is the only Chinese company to have established a Global Cybersecurity Task Force to work directly with international governments (with great success in Canada and the United Kingdom) to develop ways to mollify the fears of international governments; and that it is the only Chinese vendor to have set up a North American Cybersecurity office. Beyond the misinformation or gaps in the reported facts, even more shocking to me is how little accountability there is for these reports on the US side. We have never seen it detailed, for example, where members of Congress, like Senator Rubio, are getting their information or who is supporting their lobbying on this issue.”
Further, with respect to WeChat and TikTok, while there is no arguing that these applications and their parent companies (Tencent and Bytedance, respectively) have access to significant amounts of user data, the US is hardly a paragon of respect for personal data privacy. The revelations of Edward Snowden point to the fact the US government doesn’t have a pristine record on data privacy. But beyond that, US technology giants Google, Facebook, and Twitter have become masters at scraping personal data and selling it to the world. The United States can’t occupy the moral high ground here.
The US-China trade war. Trump’s trade war is not going well. There are a number of reasons for this. Over the last three years, the US treatment of China has not only been disrespectful, it has also been incompetent. Having US Trade Representative Peter Navarro as a central figure in US-China trade discussions is an odd choice: he is the author of an inflammatory and sensational book about China. His selection indicates that the Trump administration had little interest in respectful diplomatic talks with China, the world’s soon-to-be largest economy. In the cases of WeChat and TikTok, the Trump administration was lambasting China yet again, lashing out with aggressive executive orders against its homegrown talent. Unfortunately, it appears that the administration could not defend what Trump wanted to achieve with these executive orders, especially in today’s social-media-rich and connected world.
Moreover, with many of its decisions, the Trump administration comes across as struggling in the trade war negotiations. Take, for example, the tariffs: You cannot find a credible economist who will agree with the administration that the tariffs (a) are good for American consumers and (b) will make any headway on bringing jobs back to America. Tariffs are not paid by China. They are paid by the companies that are transporting goods from China to the United States. This tax goes to the US Treasury. The two largest exporters from China to the United States are Walmart and Apple. With today’s shareholder capitalism, the majority of this tax is passed on to US consumers. In the case of Walmart especially, which has a customer base that is largely lower- and middle-income consumers, what you have is a transfer of wealth from lower- and middle-income consumers to the US Treasury. Further, in our advisory work with US companies, not a single one has confirmed that they are moving manufacturing back to the United States as a result of the tariffs. Perhaps moving manufacturing to Vietnam or Malaysia, but no one is talking about relocating manufacturing jobs to America.
What does all this mean for the cases we are discussing here? At first glance, there is a logic to targeting companies like Tencent and Bytedance for a protectionist war as they go out into the global market. But rather than basic trade war escalation, the administration needs to find other ways to look strong.
Protectionism, pure and simple.The third argument might be that this is just retaliatory protectionist play. The Chinese government is a protectionist cheerleader for its high-tech national champions. It has kept foreign competition – Google, Facebook, and Twitter, to name a few – outside its borders so that China’s homegrown technology companies could survive their infancy without being gobbled up by their fierce foreign competition. It is in this protected environment that China’s national champions in the tech sector matured and thrived.
Perhaps the WeChat and TikTok executive orders (together with the executive order excluding Huawei from the US market) are just a reprisal against the exclusion of Facebook, Google, and Twitter from the Chinese market. If this is the case, it is interesting to note that the Chinese Rule by Law system is more effective at backing up protectionist policies than the US Rule of Law system where you can’t control federal judges.
Ultimately, the constitutionality of the executive orders will be decided in the courts. U.S. District Judge Laurel Beeler, who ruled against the administration, has scheduled an Oct. 15 hearing on the Justice Department’s request she reconsider her ruling and allow the WeChat order to go forward. And U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols, who rejected the government’s invoking of the Espionage Act last month in the TikTok case, has given the parties until Nov. 12 to offer additional filings before he makes his final decision. As to the rationale for the Trump administration’s motivation for aggressively pursuing WeChat and TikTok, which may or may not come up in court, we are placing bets on the trade war and protectionism.
