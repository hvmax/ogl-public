### OGL's Guthrie in the News

9 November 2023|China, China politics, Economic Development
AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy and, in particular, life in China. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. We have written about economic development in China and China’s economic reforms, US-China relations, China’s changing role in the global political economy, and the history and current state of Chinese politics. We write, advise, and coach corporate leaders about the political climate and current state of the economy in China. Occasionally, we are also called upon by media representatives to think through current issues emerging for doing business in China. In this post, we bring our readers two such recent reports, one a Bloomberg News Network Interview and the second, answers to questions put forward by CNN.
Doug Guthrie: Apple is Married to China, but it just can't leave.
Doug Guthrie, OGL founder and CEO, professor of global leadership and China at the Thunderbird School of Global Management, former senior director at Apple and Faculty member at Apple University in China, joins BNN Bloomberg to discuss Apple's complex relationship with the Chinese government. He says Apple's manufacturing will be heavily tied to China for the inevitable future, despite reports of an India push.Watch the interview here.
More recently, Professor Guthrie responded to questions from CNN Reporter/Digital Producer Laura He about China’s crackdown on the private sector.Read the story here.
Guthrie's answers to CNN questions:
1. Before this year, Beijing had launched a years-long crackdown on the country’s private enterprise, ranging from tech to education sectors, as it sees the private-sector business as too powerful or causing economic/social instability.  Do you think the crackdown is over?
No, the crackdown is not over. My reading of the landscape is the following. First, while the crackdown on tech and education sectors seems to have winded down, it is important to note that, over the last decade, China has entered a new phase of regulatory control over the private sector and foreign investors. In the early years of the current regime (2013-18), the stance that was adopted was a “Rule BY Law” approach, where the government passed a number of regulations that were nearly impossible to comply with. Examples of this were the Labor Dispatch Regulations (2014) and the Cybersecurity Law (2015). In some cases, these regulatory changes were so difficult to comply with that companies were often left open to aggressive corporate governance rulings by central and local officials. Signals were sent, and companies figured out ways to comply with, support, and partner with the Chinese government. In recent years, the most aggressive and high-profile action taken was the blockage of the ANT Financial IPO in November of 2020. The message was clear: regardless of global financial status – e.g., a public listing on the NYSC – if you are a Chinese company, you will work with the Chinese Government first and foremost; and if you do not, you will suffer significant consequences. In recent years, it seemed that the a “crackdown” had abated. However, my view is just that the government had sent strong enough signals that no private Chinese corporation would be allowed to act in a way that was not in partnership and coordination with the Chinese government.
So, bottom line: the “crackdown” is not over. This type of aggressive corporate governance is still going on and will continue into the future. Beijing will use selective cases to send signals to the market that behaviours and practices that do not fit with the Central government’s goals will not be tolerated. The cases of Doyou and Shandong Wohua are very clearly part of this continuing trend.
2. Why is Beijing continuing to toughen its stance on businesses?
Beijing has very specific economic and political agendas. Businesses will be allowed to survive and thrive as long as they are serving the government’s mission and goals. These goals are largely based on economic development and maintaining a unified political system that is committed to the continued successful development of China. This process of development has seen great success since the economic opening in 1979, seeing 800 million people lifted out of poverty and seeing China rise to the world’s second largest economy. However, since 2013, Beijing has made it very clear that even as Chinese companies become more global, they must continue to partner with the Chinese government (Central and local governments) and they must continue to serve China’s interests. Those that fail to do so, will suffer costly consequences.
3. FDI into China hasturned negativefor the first time in 25 years. Beijing has tried to reverse the outflows and woo foreign capital to support the country’s wobbly economy. But will the missing or detention of more Chinese entrepreneurs dent business confidence?  Will it scare away international investors?
This question must be addressed on two levels. First, for foreign companies that are largely trying to gain access to China vast consumer markets, and in particular attempting to do so through closely regulated sectors – namely, technology, finance, and education – some will undoubtedly be scared away. So, we will continue to see declines in foreign capital in these sectors. Second, for those that are heavily dependent on China’s vast and integrated manufacturing supply chain, they will continue to invest in and operate in China, and there will be no downturn in investment. If anything, China is successfully expanding its dominance as the most powerful manufacturing supply chain in the world. Companies like Apple, Tesla, and Walmart, will continue to operate in China, will continue to invest there, and will continue to find ways to closely partner with the Chinese government. Despite the recent handwaving surrounding the building of a Foxconn factory in Chennai, Foxconn is just one final assembly factory. China’s vast integrated manufacturing supply chain, which companies like Apple, Tesla, Walmart, and many others rely heavily on, will continue to dominate global manufacturing for decades to come.
4. What do you think is the investment outlook of China for global business?
From an economic standpoint, I am actually quite optimistic about the investment outlook of China for global business for at least the next decade. My prediction is that China *will* continue to grow at close-to-projected levels of growth. It *will* surpass the United States as the world’s largest economy, and it will continue to grow beyond this period. And it *will* continue to control the world’s most sophisticated manufacturing supply chain. Finally, as China continues to take on a greater leadership role with the “Global South” through institutions like the expanded BRICS coalition and through the Belt and Road Initiative, foreign investors are going to have to deal with China more and more. They will continue to invest resources in China because China will play a key role in global economic manufacturing and growth for decades to come.
