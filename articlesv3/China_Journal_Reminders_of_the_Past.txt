AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide analyses about leadership in the global economy. In this post, Dr. Doug Guthrie, who is a co-founder of OGL, continues to curate a special series of China Journal entries over the next two weeks as he returns to China for the first time in four years. In this post, Dr. Guthrie contemplates his China past, and discusses another field interview that brings up some memories from his time as a graduate student in Shanghai.
Feeling a mix of emotions as I continue my trip. My first interview day in China was amazing. So good to be back in China doing face-to-face, on-the-ground research. But there are so many feelings about my previous life. In my early morning walk around Shanghai’s Jingan District where I am staying now, my mind drifted back thirty years. This place brings back so many memories of my time here as a struggling graduate student, my time traveling back and forth from America to Shanghai as a young professor, my time here with my three kids and my wife, Mira.
One interesting sidenote: China has played such an outsized role in my life to this point, including being the reason Mira and I got married. In 2014, when we decided to return to China, we were in a lifetime partnership with two children, but China would not grant us a family visa unless we were married, so we had a private ceremony and moved the kids to China. Interestingly, we moved to the same place I am staying at this moment.
As mentioned in a previous journal entry, my brand as a knowledgeable and legitimate China scholar is closely tied to the experience of on-the-ground interviews with players in the market; individuals who are interpreting their environments, feeling the pressures of a rapidly changing marketplace and society and making decisions to help move the economic ideas they hold forward. Anyone can read China’s State Statistical Yearbook and draw what conclusions they will from them, but hearing the unique perspectives of actors in the marketplace is something different. These meetings may not be easily aggregated to broad forces or trends in the market, but they give us unique insights into the datapoints that define the economic transition.
On December 5, my colleagues, Diane Long and Chris Gao, and I sat down with a senior manager of the China International Trust and Investment Corporation (CITIC) to discuss the recent deal the fund did with America’s iconic consumer brand, McDonald’s, which entered China in the early 1990s. When I first lived in Shanghai in 1994, the country had ten restaurants, one of which was located a block away from my dorm room at the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences. By 2016, there were 5,500 restaurants, making China the brand’s second-largest market in the world.
But the 2010s saw a slowdown in sales for the restaurant. As early as 2013, there were signals that the market was weakening for the restaurant, with revenues dropping by 5.5% in that year and nearly 10% by 2015. In January 2017, the company announced that it would sell its shares to CITIC and the Carlyle Group, effectively franchising the company in the one country where it had originally resisted going down the franchise path. The interesting twist in this journey is that, in 2023, the company decided it wanted back into the world’s largest consumer marketplace, announcing in November that it was repurchasing Carlyle’s stake in the China operations. Thus, the McDonald’s corporation re-entered China as a large minority shareholder – owning 48% to CITIC’s 52% -- of the company’s China business.
We received a warm welcome from the CITIC manager and sat down to a nice breakfast to discuss the CITIC-McDonald’s partnership, the Chinese economy, the APEC meetings and the Presidential Summit, and the future of U.S.-China relations. Like every major corporation and investment firm, CITIC has its own economists who are analyzing data, watching macroeconomic trends, reading the tea leaves, trying to predict the future. It was enthralling to hear someone at his level working to predict the future, working to analyze where the country is headed, what the numbers mean, and where the economic opportunities are. It was a heady meeting, and look for a McDonald’s in China case reflecting our interview soon on theOGL site.
