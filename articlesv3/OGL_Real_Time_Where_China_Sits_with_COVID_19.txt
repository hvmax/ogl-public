31 December 2022|China, Coronavirus, COVID, Leadership
On Global Leadership's feature, OGL Real Time, presents our up-to-the-minute insights on current news and events. We hope these breaking news insights from our OGL team members will help illuminate the events of the day and provide the depth needed to understand global political, economic and cultural transitions and transformations.This Real Time Q&A seeks to further explore the current situation in China with respect to the government’s current policy on COVID-19, the impact of the demonstrations, the re-opening of the economy, and public sentiment.
After China's long commitment to its Zero-COVID policy, the Beijing government has finally reversed course, and in a rather dramatic and accelerated fashion. Some Western media outlets have connected this reversal to the recent protests. Some have argued that Beijing has changed course because of the economic threat a continued lockdown might pose.
Based on your on-the-ground observations, how do you read the drivers of the new policies?
We believe that the decision to relax Zero-COVID is a policy adjustment because Zero-COVID measures (mainly the lockdown) have not been working effectively to prevent the spread of the Omicron variant.
In the first two years of COVID-19, regional lockdowns were supported by the majority of ordinary people. The public is well aware of the seriousness of COVID-19, and regional lockdowns ensured the normal life of people in most other areas. In 2022, however, the Omicron variant proved a different animal. Its severity was milder but still not mild, and Omicron’s high level of transmissibility exceeded the control capacity and operational capability of grassroots organizations in China.
Entering Q4 2022, China's economy slowed down again, with provincial fiscal revenue in decline. Officials at different levels of government were already exhausted. More and more ordinary people had experienced lockdowns, and they weren't sure when they would return to normal life. People began to ask the question, “people first or epidemic prevention first?” It is obvious that current epidemic prevention measures were unable to effectively stop the spread of Omicron. Meanwhile, as the severity of the virus declined, relaxing Zero-COVID seemed an obvious choice for China. Without a doubt, there are already many expectations of future policy changes, and the question is when and how.
The CPC 20th National Congress in October affirmed the Zero-COVID policy.20 Measuresintroduced on November 11 aimed at relaxing the "Zero COVID" policy such as narrowing the scope of lockdowns from an entire community to a specific building, it still demanded the spread of the epidemic be controlled. Unfortunately,20 Measureswas issued at a time when the Omicron outbreak was on the rise, and many local governments in China were unable to fully understand the intentions of the central government. As infection figures went out of control, they had to return to the old way of stricter lockdowns, which made people unhappy. This likely ignited the small-scale demonstrations in some cities at the end of November 2022.
To the general public's surprise, Beijing released10 Measuresjust 26 days after20 Measures, or about one week after the A4 demonstrations. It is a fundamental shift from Zero COVID. The epidemic prevention policy focuses on medical treatment going forward.10 Measureswas an abrupt but not a reckless decision.
The risks of lifting prevention and control measures are obvious even to ordinary people: winter is the high season for respiratory infectious diseases and other diseases, and most booster shots in China were given six months ago. Major areas in China have entered winter. The Chinese New Year is in 50 days. If China has to give up Zero COVID anyway, can or should Beijing afford to wait another three to six months?
On November 28, 2022, the U.S. Embassy told U.S. citizens in China to keep a supply of 14 days of medications, bottled water, and food for their household, because they believed that Chinese authorities had expanded COVID-19 prevention restrictions and control measures as outbreaks occurred. U.S. diplomats in China miscalculated Beijing’s next move.
After more than two years of intensive national epidemic prevention, China suddenly has entered a period of national COVID infection. There appeared little planning or true warning before dropping protocols. It has left many loyal supporters of the Chinese government asking questions on social media. They are having difficulty accepting the change, which generally feels way too radical and immediate. They expected Beijing would have planned more thoroughly to allow people to have more time to prepare.
How are President Xi and the Party handling the messaging of the reversal of policy and the current surge in COVID cases in China right now?
The meeting of CPC Politburo Standing Committee was held before the release of20 Measures, and a meeting of the CPC Politburo was held before10 Measures.Therefore, every major change in epidemic prevention policy appears to be the result of the collective decision making of the CPC's top leadership. To evaluate the pros and cons of China's new move on epidemic prevention, we need to wait longer, to a minimum until the first quarter of 2023, after the test of large-scale population movement during the Chinese Spring Festival. So far, the Chinese government has not lost too much politically, because no other political force has benefited from the policy change.
Over the last few weeks, there have been many reports in Western media about how the demonstrations in China, sparked by the COVID lockdown policies. However, some reports also suggest that a significant population are actually against the loosening of COVID lockdown restrictions. Based on your reading of Chinese social media, please give some thoughts of the general population’s mood regarding the new COVID policies.
Due to some very sensitive political slogans shown during the demonstrations, it has deviated from the intention to express dissatisfaction on epidemic prevention measures, so A4 has not received the full support of the Chinese people. The A4 movement lasted only three days, thanks to the Chinese government's security policies.
Authorities accused external forces of seizing the opportunity to engage in political manipulation and to try to trigger a revolution in China. There are many stories circulating on Chinese social media, mocking the ineffectiveness of external forces and their agents withholding funds for the activity. After the lifting of the Zero COVID policy, participants in and supporters of A4 have come under more criticism. After China changed its Zero-COVID policy, practices by the United States and other Western countries seemed to have endorsed the Chinese government's accusations regarding external forces.
After three years of COVID in China, please provide some on-the-ground experience and observations of how Chinese society may have been changed for the long term, focusing on social dynamics and social structure.
Chinese people do not want to miss this coming spring after three years of security measures and lockdowns. Here are a few observations that will be long remembered and discussed:
Common sense matters. Common sense is that epidemic prevention is for people's lives, not an end in itself. Common sense is there will be a wave of infections after relaxing, so keep some medications. If many people you know are testing positive for COVID, and daily 3,000-4,000 new positive cases arise, the data released by the National Health Commission (NHC) may be contrary to people's common sense. At the end of 2022, most people in Shanghai accepted the status quo, because common sense had told them that "it can't be worse than April and May, when the city was under lockdown -- never seen in the city’s history".China's acquaintances culture (熟人文化) has been strengthened. During the pandemic period, the people who can help you the most are your family members, your neighbors and your friends. Among all information sources, people trust real experience from acquaintances much more than official media. The younger generation is accustomed to the virtual world, and they may come to realize the value of the real world through the pandemic.Chinese society has been diversified. After more than 40 years of reform and opening up, diversification has been one of the most significant characteristics of China's profound economic and social change. The debates on epidemic prevention and control in China have proved the challenge of coordinating the demands of different stakeholders, and amplifying or ignoring the voices of any interest group could have unintended consequences. Beijing and Shanghai are the undisputed centers of public opinion, so all COVID-related issues have be amplified in these two cities. There are also many more tier 3, 4 and 5 cities in China that are home to China's silent majority that might not be on social media. Thus, mainstream public opinion cannot be judged by social media alone.In the eyes of the public, the NHC has been deemed a loser in the three-year campaign of epidemic prevention and control, mainly due to its performance in 2022. The epidemic data released by NHC lacks the rigor that a professional organization should have. Taking the COVID fatality rate as an example, in order to support Shanghai’s lockdown, the definition of the "cause of death" was changed from "die of" to "die with", which greatly increased the severity of the virus. After shifting its Zero-COVID policy, the definition was changed from "die with" back to "die of". In terms of COVID-19, the Chinese people are calm, tenacious and sensible. Seeking truth from facts and letting the people know the real information will definitely have a greater positive effect than a negative one. In terms of information transparency, Chinese officials should have more confidence in the wisdom of Chinese people.
