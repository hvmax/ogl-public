### Cross-Cultural Leadership: When the Other Culture is Russia

18 March 2022|Leadership
Our leadership team is watching what's happening in Ukraine with both our hearts and our minds fully engaged. Like you, we are saddened by the deaths and massive dislocation of a free people. We also see in it clear leadership lessons for our times as the international community responds to the war. As this unfolds, or devolves, we urge caution in how we describe the Russian people and what expectations we put on them in this critical and chaotic moment. - The OGL Editorial Team
The war in Ukraine has created many challenges for business leaders. Most prominent, for large businesses especially, are the decisions regarding withdrawal from or continuing operation in the Russian market. Others may be experiencing supply-chain or remote workforce disruptions. Closer to home is the vital clarification of companies’ positions vis-à-vis Russia for the publics and governments in Western Europe and North America.

Internally, too, leaders have had to manage the anxieties and potential disagreements of employees and colleagues with differing political beliefs and concerns about the impact of changes in business wrought by the Ukrainian crisis. To these, we might raise a further challenge: the need to acknowledge the adversities of the Russian people who, amidst forceful calls to constrain Vladimir Putin and those close to him, including oligarchs, are often largely left out of discussions about the conflict and responses to it.
Sanctions, withdrawals, and disengagements are perhaps the most notable of the many current economic actions that relate to corporate leadership during this crisis. Sanctions are both political and economic, of course, and they have a mixed historical record.The Global Sanctions Database, maintained at Drexel University, has tracked sanctions and their mixed results over more than five decades. Yet part of what distinguishes this crisis in 2022 is how, in different ways, politics have taken priority over markets and business activity in a way that has not been seen for more than three decades. Recall that post-Cold War globalization, beginning in the 1990s, prioritized the faster and faster flows of people goods capital and information across borders through less and less political regulation. In the sanctions now mounted against Russia, a political imperative has taken precedence and mobilized economic and market forces. For many business leaders, this shift requires a greater reckoning with geopolitical issues than they have needed for many years.
The Yale Management School’s Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, in histracking the withdrawal of Western businesses from Russia, has shined a light on the various levels of disengagement and often competing motivations faced by corporate leaders in doing so. In fact, while discussing the motivations of many companies, Sonnenfeld highlights the “strong reputational incentive to withdraw,” that is, the perception of companies in the West and by the Western public rather than any potential political or economic impact on Russia.
To his credit, Sonnenfeld also acknowledges the inconsistent historical record of economic boycotts and, citing the example of Apartheid-era South Africa, the risk of a disproportionate impact on ordinary Russian people. This should not be surprising. As political scientist Dursun Peksen notes, these economic actions always need “to strike a balance between political gain and civilian pain.” In the current case of Russia, much of what remains unaddressed in Western debates is the amount of pain being delivered to Russian civilians in the attempt to produce some political effect on President Putin and his circle.
The characterization of the Russian people across Western media coverage of the war appears much less clearcut than that of the Ukrainian people. Recurrent emphasis on the suffering of the Ukrainian people at the hands of the Russian military, combined with coverage of millions of refugees leaving the country, positions Ukrainians as victims. At the same time, President Zelenskyy and other official voices have underscored how the Ukrainian people embody broadly European and specifically democratic values. As a result, a related discourse is the heroic and freedom-seeking Ukrainian resistance to invasion.
While less consistently developed, the corresponding discourse for Russians is as perpetrators or collaborators. Besides the military invaders, consistent attention is paid to the political and economic beneficiaries of the current Russian government. The foremost groups addressed by many media and politicians are the oligarchs andthesiloviki(or ‘men of force’),the tight circle around Vladimir Putin drawn from leaders of the military and intelligence sectors in that country who have long known the president and are primary targets for sanctions.

In a contrast that sharpens the definition of these perpetrators, some coverage is given to individuals seen as resistors or heroic victims of Putin's government. Jailed opposition leader Alexei Navalny and 2021 Nobel Peace Laureate journalist Dmitry Muratov are the foremost exemplars of this group. Likewise, younger Russian generations sometimes appear as both better able to access Western media information and more willing to risk participation in public protests against the government. But other Russians, particularly the great majority who don’t fit easily into the perpetrator/collaborator-resistance binary, are much less commonly addressed. Probably the largest subgroup of ordinary Russians, implied in the consistent attention given in the West to the manipulations of media and information in Russia, are citizens who are willing or unconscious dupes of the Russian state and its official media and narratives. For this subgroup, especially, the default response of many Western media, people, and governments alike is Russophobic fear, prejudice, and mistreatment.

Despite being a predictable metaphor, the implicit Western media messaging about these ordinary Russians can resemble stacking Russian doll (Matryoshka) figures: beneath their outer layers, which help them to cope with harsh living conditions brought on by the government or the economy, these Russians live fuller private lives. More nuanced commentators, likeThe New Yorker’s Masha Gessen, emphasize precisely theseconflicting public and private responses to the current crisis, drawing comparison to the double lives, or at least behaviors, of the Soviet era. But more typically, the impression of ordinary Russians can be of capitalists or democratic citizens trying to get out from under the yoke of autocratic rule and a cronyistic economy. One of the great problems with trying to recognize and respect Russian people from Western media accounts is that little attention is paid to potential future scenarios for the country and for them besides ending the rule of Vladimir Putin. Paths toward potential democratization and moves toward Western-style capitalism are rarely formulated. The tacit assumption appears to be that, perpetrators aside, they all just want to be like us.
Wartime always brings distortions and oversimplifications in the ways that media and politicians represent other peoples. The consistent calls and multiple actions taken recently to punish the Russian nation often appear to disregard the Russian people presumably at its heart. On March 1, the French Finance Minister Bruno LeMaire said bluntly that, “We will cause the collapse of the Russian economy.” One wonders, beyond indicators like the cross-border flows of capital and goods, exactly what impact he envisioned for that collapse. Historically, wartime allegiances, and the media messaging reinforcing them, have often been a zero-sum game. Social media now amplifies the force of such Manichaean representations and, with the war in Ukraine, the omission if not outright demonization of Russian people. Avoiding their humiliation and even ‘collapse’ is a priority that government and corporate leaders and everyday citizens elsewhere need to adopt now.
Forward-looking analysts are already discussing the longer-term consequences of the current crisis. The Eurasia Group’s Ian Bremmer, for example, sees the severe economic sanctions driving a “decoupling of the Russian economy from the West.” Moreover, combined with the pandemic, this decoupling is going to “seriously unwind the growth of the global middle class,” including Russia’s, that flourished during the last three decades of globalization. The resulting multipolar era will require a greater willingness and ability, from leaders and citizens alike, to understand and engage differences more actively. Embracing multiple ideas about how individuals want to live their lives, build their communities, and advance their societies and economies will require us to appreciate differences rather than trying to homogenize our political and economic assumptions and expectations.
In other words, for leaders and citizens alike, such a revised framing can embrace working to end the war and the suffering it is causing, supporting the Ukrainian people and – at the same time – backing the Russian people other than the political and military decision makers who have brought about this conflict. In management thinking and practice, this multidimensional approach is sometimes referred to as both/and leadership. Across cultures, a both/and approach entails the willingness to understand and interact with different kinds of people, different sets of political and economic priorities, and different ways of approaching global relations. This is not to suggest absolute tolerance of any alternative social or political (or military) pursuit. It does, however, recognize the complex differences among peoples, historical legacies, and ways of seeing the world in the global family of nations.
A crucial if difficult insight of both/and thinking is that embracing multiple groups and priorities at once, particularly in the realm of culture and politics, can be messy. Too often, comparisons of peoples or nations are rejected because they fail to meet an artificial standard of equivalence, be it moral or ideological; lost is the recognition that important similarities can still exist amidst differences and inconsistencies. At a time when many business leaders globally are prioritizing the fuller understanding and inclusion of diverse perspectives and experiences in the workplace, they strive to look beyond their own biases and reducing people to affiliations with specific racial, gender, ethnic, or other groups. The imperative is to respect whole persons beyond any single attribute, affiliation, or orientation and to interact with their similarities as well as their differences. Having the commitment to be open to the humanity of ordinary Russians – a humanity we share across political, economic, and cultural borders – and the courage to act and support them accordingly, is today’s litmus test for cross-cultural leadership.
