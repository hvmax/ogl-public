The On Global Leadership feature, OGL Real Time, presents our up-to-the-minute commentary on current news and events. We hope these breaking news insights from our OGL team members will help illuminate the events of the day and provide the depth needed to understand global political, economic and cultural transitions and transformations.This Real Time Q&A examines the recent trip by French President Macron to China, and considers the geopolitical impact of his efforts to strengthen his relationship with China's President Xi.
French President Emmanuel Macron (and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen) finished their 3-day-trip to China recently. Did China get what it expected from the visit?
President Xi couldn’t have asked for a better result from the trip, as French President Macron, on his flight home, told western reporters that Europe shouldnotbe a “follower” of the United States, and that Europe has no interest in getting involved in the status of Taiwan. “The paradox would be that, overcome with panic, we believe we are just America’s followers,” Macron said in aPoliticointerview. “The question Europeans need to answer … is it in our interest to accelerate [a crisis] on Taiwan? No." China couldn’t have scripted it better.
The comments might have brought cheers in Beijing, but Macron quickly found himself in frigid water in Europe, as his peers in European leadership rejected his comments on both the U.S. and Taiwan. (Macron even doubled-downed on the comments upon his return to France, suggesting Europe wasn't interested in becoming the U.S.'s "vassal.") German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius pointedly noted, "We have never been in danger of becoming or being a vassal of the United States.”
One of the reasons for the trip’s uniqueness was Xi’s informal rendezvous with Macron in Guangzhou’s Pine Garden, an exceptional level of treatment that perhaps would have been reserved in the past for the presidents of the United States. It is obvious China had expected something from Macron and France, and he delivered.
China sees France as a comparable advocate of independent and autonomous foreign policies, although France has welcomed the U.S. support of Europe in Russia’s war on Ukraine. There are some interesting similarities between China and France:
Centralized state political system;Revolutionary and deep socialistic roots;Both were traditionally agricultural countries;Pursue an independent foreign diplomacy.
• Centralized state political system;
• Revolutionary and deep socialistic roots;
• Both were traditionally agricultural countries;
• Pursue an independent foreign diplomacy.
Even more than 100 years ago, the famous Chinese scholar Gu Hong-ming [辜鸿铭] wrote in his bookThe Spirit of the Chinese People: "The French are the people, it seems to me, who can understand and have understood the real Chinese and the Chinese civilization best". Today, many in China believe France is probably the country in Europe that understands China best.
Of course, in China, Macron may feel more glorious than in France. He has been under attack for months, facing protests by millions of his fellow countrymen for his efforts to increase France’s pension reforms. While his reason for coming to China was nominally to urge China to not take sides with Russia in its war with Ukraine, but there was a lot more to it.
Sixty French business executives came with Macron, and the opening of China’s market to French products was clearly a benefit of the trip, including an order for 160 Airbus-built planes. “Both sides will deepen cooperation in aviation, aerospace and civilian nuclear power, which are our traditional areas of cooperation. We will cultivate new cooperation and new growth pillars in green development and innovation, including jointly setting up a centre for carbon neutralization and talent training,” Xi said, according to state news agency Xinhua. China sees opportunity to promote the sense of independence and the strategic autonomy of France and Europe.
Is it true that China invited the French president and accepted the European Commission President coming along?
China's protocols toward France as a head of state were quite different from the head of European Commission as an organization. There were obvious differences in the arrangements for Macron and von der Leyen (see below table for details). But Beijing seemed willing to let Ursula von der Leyen and Emmanuel Macron sing a duet in China, at times in harmony and at other times not.
Letting von der Leyen join the visit would allow her to criticize China in a way that is inconvenient for the cunning French. The less she is liked by the Chinese, the more popular she is with American and European China hardliners, favoring her to run for future NATO leadership. Being a hardliner on China, von der Leyen still said that Europe cannot de-couple from China, in result it earned her meetings with the Chinese president and premier. Of course, the Chinese top leader also used this opportunity to bash her, noting "If anyone expects China to compromise and concede on the Taiwan question, they are having a pipe dream..."
The fact that European leaders can come to China shows that China and the EU still have an ongoing dialogue, have some common interests, and continue normal relations under the cloud of "de-coupling" between China and the United States. The visits of leaders from Germany, Spain, France and EU to China in just a few months have demonstrated that China-European relations have stabilized, even as European leaders talk about “de-risking” their competitive relationship with China.
What was President Xi’s response to European entreaties urging China to not support Russia in the Russia-Ukraine war?
For China, it is indeed good for Europe to maintain its strategic independence, but at the moment, the Ukraine war has pushed many European countries toward the United States and strengthened their decades-old relationship with NATO. The invasion has given Europeans a strong sense of insecurity. Europe countries, either because of their own ideology or moral standards, have sided with Ukraine, both politically and emotionally. Meanwhile, China has stayed neutral in terms of directly sending weapons to Russia, although it has frequently touted its deep friendship with Russia and provided other financial support such as buying Russian oil. (Russia surpassed Saudi Arabia to become China’s top oil supplier in the first two months of 2023.) Europeans have interpreted this “neutrality” as supporting Russia.
During the visit, the two European leaders kept pushing China on the Ukrainian war, with harsh words from the European Commission president and a more pragmatic tone from the French president, who believes China could have a ‘game-changer’ effect on the conflict. Xi remained open to speaking with Ukrainian President Zelenskyy, but only when the time is right and offered to “support all efforts to restore peace in Ukraine” in a joint statement between China and France. China is also working with the Global South leaders like Brazilian President Lula on a possible solution.
How can the European Union and China rebalance their trade relations with the breakdown of a landmark trade deal, which has been stalled since 2020, especially after von der Leyen’s comments last week urging EU countries to “de-risk” from dependency on China?
China is the EU’s No.1 origin of its imports (20.8%), No. 2 trade partner (15.4%), and No. 3 destination of exports (9.0%).
The China Ministry of Commerce reported that in 2022 the trade between the EU’s 27 countries and China resulted in:
Total trade between China and the EU was euro 856.3 billion, up 22.8%, 15.4% of EU total (EU with US euro 867.7 billion, up 37.1%, 15.6% of EU)Export to China euro 230.3 billion, up 3.0%Import from China euro 626.0 billion, up 32.1%EU trade deficit euro 395.7 billion, up 58.1%
• Total trade between China and the EU was euro 856.3 billion, up 22.8%, 15.4% of EU total (EU with US euro 867.7 billion, up 37.1%, 15.6% of EU)
• Export to China euro 230.3 billion, up 3.0%
• Import from China euro 626.0 billion, up 32.1%
• EU trade deficit euro 395.7 billion, up 58.1%
The trade numbers for the first two months of 2023 show down trending. But if EU wants to balance the trade, there is a huge gap to be filled. Any disengagement won’t help its economy. China understands EU’s awkward position on the China-EU Investment Agreement under the current geopolitical pressure from the US. China will not re-open this talk but wants to find the fissure between the EU and the US to stimulate a European strategic autonomy, if there is such thing, especially countries like Germany and France, which don’t want to be ruled by the US. For China, the rhetoric of de-risking rather than de-coupling is only acceptable from a supply chain point of view, after having experienced the chaos and shortfalls from the pandemic. What China worries about is that under the name of “de-risking”, the EU implements a “de-coupling”. In the end, China doesn’t trust von der Leyen because she is viewed as being too close to the United States.
How will Xi respond to Macron’s charm offensive and his visit to the city of Guangzhou?
Macron’s previous visits were to Xi’an and Shanghai. His visit to Guangdong this time was a meditated plan by Beijing to showcase an investment opportunity. The Greater Bay Area (GBA) has been an ambition for Guangdong’s outreach to Hong Kong and Macao, and there is a 55-kilometer ocean bridge that links the areas. GBA has over 80 million people and accounts for RMB 13 trillion in GDP. It is home to vast numbers of high-tech companies, creative industries and private enterprises. The area has a natural cross-border cooperation and is closer to ASEAN markets. Unfortunately, the plan was hindered by the Hong Kong street protest movements, and then the pandemic lockdowns. GBA provides opportunities for co-investments with Chinese investors targeting Southeast Asian markets, where there already have been active Chinese businesses. China-ASEAN trade reached RMB 6.5 trillion in 2022.
France has its own "interests" in the Asia-Pacific region, with overseas territories and military operations. Will China respect those interests? Or will there likely be some pushback on French pressure?
Actually, in China's eyes today, France has the best soft power in its history, arts and literature. The Chinese appreciate France’s attitude toward the United States, as well. AUKUS, the strategic military partnership between Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States (AUKUS) in the Indo-Pacific, has sidelined French role there, and France was not happy to be excluded.
In his conversations in China, France brought up European strategic autonomy, shorthand now for keeping the U.S. and its policies at a measured distance, which China wants to see. If China is sophisticated enough to indulge France’s leadership aspirations, yet not be openly judged by France on human rights issues, the Taiwan Strait and South China Sea issues, France can be a reasonable ally for China. The fact that Xi flew to Guangzhou to be with Macron shows an eagerness in developing a stronger relationship, and the order of 160 airplanes from Airbus is a big gift to Macron to take home and claim success.
