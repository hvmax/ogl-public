### China's Industrial Clusters: Suzhou Industrial Park

17 August 2020|China, City Profile, Innovation
AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy and, in particular, life in China. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. We have sought to advance a conversation about the U.S.-China relationship, and a deep understanding of local economic development in China. We have written a series about the strategic strength oflocal economic development in China’s 2nd and 3rd tier citiesandentrepreneurship in China today. This post adds to that conversation. – The Editorial Team

There is a famous Chinese proverb: Above there is heaven and below there is Suzhou and Hangzhou (上有天堂下有苏杭). That sounds impressive – and it is – but it was not meant to be a statement about Suzhou and Hangzhou’s economic prowess. Rather, it was a statement [S1] about the beauty of these places, and anyone who has strolled along the banks of West Lake in Hangzhou or the series of canals and gardens that define Suzhou’s beauty can see the logic (Suzhou is often referred to as the “Venice of the East”). Today, Hangzhou and Suzhou also are powerhouse economies in high tech and manufacturing, respectively. Following our post last week focused on Foshan, we focus here on the development of Suzhou. Today, Suzhou is technically considered a Tier One Chinese city, but this is a relatively new phenomenon. As recently as 2018, Suzhou was listed as a Tier Two city, but the modern development and transformation of this city goes back at least as far as 1992.
Our decision to focus on Suzhou relates to a research project we are conducting. Many economic research groups focus on macroeconomic data to make sense of how China is faring in the reform era. For example, theRhodium Grouphas done a wonderful job of tracking China’s economic progress through a usefuleconomic dashboard. Strong as these analyses are, our group wanted more. Macroeconomic data allow analysts to see how acountryis doing with economic progress, but it does not allow analysts to seewhich placeswithina country are doing well andwhy. We are interested in these latter questions, as they allow us to see types of investment that matter in a decentralized system like China’s.
In anearlier post, we described economic development in China this way: “Economic development in China is fundamentally shaped by government guidance and centralized control. There is a lot of strategic planning going on in five-year plans, 10-year plans, and 20-year plans… While we often think of the Chinese government as an authoritarian, protectionist, and centralized party in Beijing, that is only one side of the government. In reality, local governments are the engines driving China’s growth. Indeed, the Chinese government is an extremely decentralized and entrepreneurial system of district and township governments. The mayors of China’s districts, townships, and villages behave like corporate CEOs, focusing on Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), pursuing foreign investment, and advancing their own careers through the financial and economic achievements in their districts and townships… But local governments don’t do it alone. They do it through close coordination with China’s private sector and with foreign investors from abroad.”
Our research tracks data on 37 Tier One, Tier Two, and Tier Three cities in the Xi Jinping era of economic development. Our goal is to go deeper than standard macroeconomic indicators and to go beyond the standard cases that are the common targets for focusing on development and economic opportunities in China. We focus on economic indicators such as electricity usage, total loan balance, real estate development investment, car ownership, and many others. Like most economic modeling, we use these variables to predict economic growth, but we are looking for clues to economic growth that are a bit off the beaten path. In aprevious post, we explored the economic development of Foshan City in Guangdong Province. In this post, we explore Suzhou.
Suzhou’s economic history is complicated. As one of the endpoints of the Marco Polo’s famous Silk Road, Suzhou was a Chinese commercial center for more than a millennium. Suzhou is one of the Yangtze Valley’s oldest cities, dating back some 2,500 years. It has historically been known for its plentiful natural resources and rich cultural heritage. For centuries, the city's breathtaking pagodas, stone bridges, and manicured gardens drew visitors. Then, in the 18th and 19th centuries, when trade with the West heated up, Shanghai’s economic power grew and quickly eclipsed its municipal neighbors. Next to Hong Kong, Shanghai became the trading power of the East. So, Suzhou waited.
In the early 1990s, when Shanghai was further being positioned to be an economic center, the neighboring province, Jiangsu, also needed a plan. Jiangsu province, located just west of Shanghai, is home to the municipalities of Nanjing and Suzhou. The province is rich in agriculture and natural resources, which have helped drive its growth and industrialization. Jiangsu has a remarkable history, and vibrant political tradition, having reared many of China’s top officials. Although the economy is still heavily supported by state-owned enterprises, there is a great deal of foreign investment, as well as burgeoning private enterprise, which have heightened a fierce rivalry with Shanghai.
Compared with other Yangtze River Delta cities like Shanghai and Nanjing, the scale of industrial base state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in Suzhou has historically been small and had little or no impact on the overall economy of the region. During the early years of the economic reforms, the focus in Suzhou was on the growth of township and village enterprises (TVEs), with emphasis on both rural and urban development.
What Suzhou didn’t have was international investment. Eighteen years ago, Suzhou began to change that and has since acquired a global reputation beyond its robust tourism. Today it is known as a hotbed of foreign direct investment, entrepreneurship, and as a model of economic vitality and innovation exemplifying the promise of China’s Tier Two cities.
How did it happen that Suzhou suddenly supplanted Shanghai as the major destination of foreign direct investment (FDI) in the mid-2000s? With the backing of the Jiangsu provincial government and in coordination with the Singaporean government, the Suzhou municipal government built the China-Singapore Suzhou Industrial Park, which, for a brief time, became the No. 1 destination for FDI in China.

Recognizing early on that the city’s success would depend on its ability to remain competitive, Suzhou’s leaders saw that Singapore’s expertise developing industrial parks would assist Suzhou in attracting foreign direct investment.
With the help of Chinese paramount leader, Deng Xiaoping, Suzhou officials reached out to the Singaporean government to fund the development of an industrial park that would mimic the successful industrial parks found in Singapore. In February 1994, China and Singapore officially agreed to cooperate in developing the China-Singapore Suzhou Industrial Park. Today, the Suzhou Industrial Park is home to more than 1,000 high-tech enterprises, including those focused on nanotechnology, biomedicine, and software development.
Suzhou’s Economic Development Zone is one of the leading FDI sectors in China. Suzhou ranks as China’s fourth most prosperous city, with a GDP of 679.8 billion yuan ($103 billion in U.S. dollars). Only Shanghai, Beijing, and Guangzhou – all with GDPs of more than 1 trillion yuan ($147 billion in U.S. dollars) – ranked above Suzhou.
Today, Suzhou is the largest economy in Jiangsu Province, accounting for 22.4 percent of the province’s GDP. Suzhou has an area of 8,488 square km. and a population of 10.72 million at the end of 2019.
Role in Local Politics
Suzhou has been held up as a great example of the successful transformation of China’s economy over the last four decades, and Jiangsu province has become the second richest (GDP/per capita) in the nation. Senior ranking members of the CPC Central Committee rose through the ranks from Jiangsu Province and Suzhou municipality in particular. Others have risen through the party ranks to take on more responsibility and new assignments. A few among them, such as Wan Ming and Chen Deming, were directly involved in the construction of Suzhou Industrial Park (SIP).

The background of the province’s political leadership highlights the role of Suzhou in Jiangsu politics. Over the last three decades, most of the top political appointees have worked in Suzhou. Among the locals, Suzhou is often referred to as the “Cradle of Provincial Governors”, as many party cadres are eventually appointed as Governor of Jiangsu or of other provinces with the intention of replicating this successful economic model.
Where is Suzhou Today?
While many know the famous economic development stories in China – the stories of places like Shenzhen, Pudong, Shanghai, and Guangdong – the building of the Suzhou Industrial Park ranks right up there among them. This is the story of how the Central Government joined forces with provincial and city officials to go out and attract Singaporean capital and economic development know-how to transform a tourist destination into a manufacturing juggernaut. On top of a landfill, they constructed 60 million square feet of Class A office space – essentially, building Washington, D.C., in about 15 years. And they built manufacturing space that would attract companies from all over the world to locate their manufacturing sites there. It is truly a remarkable story of state-led economic development.
With respect to the variables we analyzed in our multi-city study, Suzhou comes up as very high on several of the variables that are statistically significant in predicting economic development. Suzhou ranks No. 1 in electricity usage, and it comes in the top 10 (adjusted for population) for general public budget income, general public budget expenses to balance of local foreign currency loans, and total retail sales. These results may not be surprising, given Jiangsu’s investment in Suzhou over the years; however, it does signal to us what variables predict economic growth in the vast number of cities across China today.
Suzhou's remarkable economic growth over the past 40 years, particularly in the last decade, is proof of the city's approach to open markets and entrepreneurial innovation. Some 5,000 foreign-funded companies call it home, and it expects its economic output to top 2 trillion yuan in 2020. Our analysis points to some of the key factors in this significant growth, and we will continue to track Suzhou and its economy as part of our China City Data Project.
