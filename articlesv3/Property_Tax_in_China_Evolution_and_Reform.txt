### Property Tax in China: Evolution and Reform

8 December 2021|China, China Population
AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy and, in particular, life in China. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. We have sought to advance a conversation about the U.S.-China relationship, and a deep understanding of local economic development in China. We have written a series about the strategic strength oflocal economic development in China’s 2nd and 3rd tier citiesandentrepreneurship in China today. We have also written about the strategy and logic of local economic development in China’s reform era. This post adds to that conversation.

Today, housing is among the most important component in the balance sheet of many Chinese households. Chinese citizens are famous for high savings rates – among the highest for advanced economies – with an average savings rate of about 44%. Traditionally, over the course of the economic reforms, these resources have been earmarked for education and healthcare. However, in the last twenty years, investment in housing has also become a significant asset class for Chinese families, and whether the housing market remains stable or not is a matter of concern for all Chinese families. To date, China is an outlier among major economies in its reluctance to impose property taxes on private housing.
In previous posts, we have written about the strategy and logic of China’s economic development model. We have used Professor Andrew Walder’s metaphorical notion oflocal governments as industrial firmsto describe China’s amazing economic development process. In China, there is, of course, central planning – five- and ten-year plans that come out of Beijing and direct the economy. Local officials have Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), by which they are measured, and their careers advance along the lines of their performance on these KPIs. They are encouraged to be innovative and entrepreneurial in building local industrial clusters and local political economies.
It is a powerful business model, and one that is effectively applied to the business of economic development in China. Yet, the building of any economy that moves away from state-owned resources to a viable market economy must construct a revenue-generating system that allows market players to pay taxes to local and central governments. Over the course of the economic reforms, China has worked to create a system to fit with the Chinese version of economic development, including a thriving real estate market that generates property taxes for local governments.
Does the Chinese government want to impose the property tax? Of course, it does. Chinese government officials and many analysts have pointed out that the reform of the property tax is a key measure for achievingCommon Prosperityand reducing wealth inequality. Since the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) first floated the idea of  “levying a tax on self-owned housing” in 2003, the path toward property tax reform has been full of twists and turns. What we see is policymakers having upward accountability and, at the same time, also downward accountability. This is one of the key complications of China’s economic reform process.
The Status and Evolution of Property Tax in China
On October 23, 2021, Chinese media disclosed the news of a new round of property tax reforms. As a key measure to respond to the Asian financial crisis in 1998, China began reforming its urban housing system and cancelled welfare housing allocations (2) that has lasted for nearly 50 years. Ever since then, the housing conditions of Chinese families have improved substantially. In 2019, the per-capita housing space available to urban residents reached 39.8 square meters, an increase of 33.7 square meters from 1978 (3), and surpassing many Western countries. At the same time, speculation in real estate has intensified, which is widely believed to have pushed up housing prices, exacerbated wealth polarization, and suppressed residents’ other consumption needs.
A nationwide survey on assets and liabilities of more than 30,000 urban families by the People’s Bank of China in October 2019 found that 74.2% of the physical assets of Chinese urban households are housing property, with an average value of ￥1.878 million($290,000) per household. Urban residents’ housing assets account for 59.1% of total household assets. Homeownership rate of urban households is 96.0% (2021Q3 homeownership rate in the U.S. is 65.4%). Among urban home owners, 58.4% have one property, 31.0% have two properties, and 10.5% have three or more properties. On average every household have 1.5 properties. It is worth noting that the property ownership rate of the lowest 20% income urban households in China is 89.1%. (4)
China currently has five types of property-related taxes that are levied specifically on the real estate industry and land usage – the House Property Tax (HPT), Urban Land Use Tax, Land Appreciation Tax, Farm Land Occupation Tax and Deed Tax, They are called the Real Estate 5 Taxes. HPT is imposed during the property-holding period, the other four taxes are imposed during the property-transaction period. Except for people living in two cities under HPT pilot reform, Shanghai and Chongqing. So far individuals who own non-commercial property haven’t needed to pay property tax. Over the years, Real Estate 5 Taxes account for about 10% of the general government budget revenue. Since the privatization of the housing market in 1998, the real estate industry has grown to a central pillar of China's economy. The revenue from the transfer of use rights of state land, the official term of land sale, is the largest source of income for local governments.
As early as 2003, the CPC Central Committee put forward the idea of levying a property tax on private housing. Since then, the property tax reform has been regularly mentioned in party and government documents, academic journals, and social media. However, there has been a drastic contrast between swift promotion in other reforms like free trade zone and the tardy advancement of property tax. In 2011, the HPT pilot finally landed only in Chongqing and Shanghai. In 2022, new property tax pilots will be carried out in more cities.
In Figure 4, we have compiled the important events and policies on the property tax reform. The gap between the frequency of policy announcements and the cautiousness in taking real actions is obvious. There are reasons for the slowness of the pilot run of the property tax.
This reform process has rolled out in fits and starts because both central and local leaders are aware of how it could disrupt the public attitudes or discourage real estate development momentum. Impediments could include:
Objections from ordinary people and government workers: Like Americans, Chinese citizens don’t like paying taxes. People generally think that paying taxes is a wealthy person’s responsibility and not theirs. Because China’s taxation is dominated by indirect taxes, people aren't aware of the actual tax burden they have. Charged directly on individuals, property tax is the type of direct tax which makes the tax payers feel the immediate burden and pain. Therefore, property tax reforms inevitably face questions, doubts and resistance. The public is deeply suspicious about the fairness of the reform plan created by those with vested interests. And many Chinese government officials and state-owned enterprise cadres have benefited from welfare housing allocation.
Controversy over the legitimacy of property tax: The forming the property rights of individual housing in China has been extremely complicated, with different sources and timeliness of land use rights for housing, different purchase restriction measures linked to the identity of the housing buyers (such as household registration, social security payment, etc.), and the huge cost differentials across the country. Since Chinese citizens don’t own private land, the argument is that, when the developer receives the land to build housing property on it, they have already paid for the land use right. So, the property tax or HPT based on a price including land use rights fee is seen by many people as an illegal double tax.
The hesitation of the local governments: After the establishment of a tax-sharing system (分税制改革) between central and local governments, the majority of local governments in China have fiscal deficits that are barely balanced by the auctioning of land. The challenge for local governments for property tax is to make a smooth transition from land finance to a legitimate property tax. China has adopted a “one location, one policy” (一地一策) strategy for the regulation on real estate industry at different development stages, measured by different household income level and resource endowments. Local governments must formulate specific implementation plans that adapt to each situation. The lack of uniformity, not surprisingly, makes the implementation of these new policies very complicated. Under fierce competition between local economies, the macro-level tax of a region directly affects their business environment and economic competitiveness.
Property tax in China is much more than wealth redistribution, as it involves vital interests of millions of Chinese families. Even with the broad support the Party has received through its management of the COVID-19 pandemic, a large majority of Chinese citizens do not support a new tax. Given the widely negative view of this reform among the Chinese population, in our assessment, the reform is a venture that may or may not work. But which cities are most likely to bear the burden?
Pilot Property Tax Reform: Feeling for Stones to Cross the River
Like many other reforms, “feeling for stones to cross the river” is the practice for property tax reform as well – gradual experimentation and gradual implementation in a step-by-step process. In this case, the steps are “legislation first, full authorization and step-by-step promotion.” In May 2010, the National Development and Reform Commission proposed to “start the reform of HPT from pilot areas”; on January 14, 2011, two of China’s largest cities, Shanghai and Chongqing were reported by the People’s Daily as the pilot cities; on January 27, 2011, both cities disclosed their implementation plans.
Taking Chongqing as one example: Huang Qifan (黄奇帆), then Mayor (2011-2016) of Chongqing city, began laying out his implementation plan at the Chongqing’s press conference on HPT this way: “In accordance with the decision of the 136th meeting of the State Council, the executive meeting of the State Council has decided on a pilot reform of some provinces and cities to levy HPT on private housing, and Chongqing is one of the pilot areas, following the requirements of the country, we are doing implementation work today.” (5) Huang vaguely mentioned the reason why Chongqing was chosen – “a decision of Beijing,” but that’s all he would say. After citing some negative comments on HPT – doubts about whether it would actually help lower the housing prices; the practical complications of collecting HPT; the view that the government just wants to collect more money; and, in the extreme views, the idea that collecting HPT violated the existing laws, etc. – Huang explained the significance of the pilot reform:
1. Taxation during property holding period can strengthen the fiscal and taxation system.
2. Adjust the structure of the housing market: ensure housing condition for low-income groups; guarantee housing supply for middle-income group at fair price; restrict high-end markets such as villas.
3. Regulate income distribution: use all HPT to build public rental housing for low-income groups.
4. Change housing consumption behavior, reducing the purchase of high-end houses and increasing the supply of the property for lease.
According to Mayor Huang, HPT has more symbolic meaning than making real impact on housing price, which is ultimately determined by factors such as land supply, household income, market demand, and structural monetary and taxation policies.
Many people believe the pilot reforms in Chongqing and Shanghai have failed from a simple fact: the pilot has been running for ten years with no conclusion. If it were successful, there would be no reason for a new pilot scheme. The officials in Shanghai and Chongqing must have racked their brains to minimize the impact of HPT, so that the pilot reforms have lost the luster painted by Mayor Huang. As a result, housing prices trend in Shanghai and Chongqing in the past ten years is almost the same as the other major cities in China, and the actual amount collected from HPT is trivial compared to the total fiscal revenue of the two cities. That is to say, the economies of Shanghai and Chongqing have maintained strong momentum, not impacted by the additional tax increase from HPT.
Now a new five-year property tax pilot reform scheme is coming, “in order to actively and steadily advance the property tax legislation and reform, lead to the rational consumption of housing and the economical and intensive use of land resources, and promote the steady and healthy development of the real estate market.” (7). Comparing the system to that of ten years ago, land finance has become unsustainable today. Local governments now have stronger incentives to construct their own tax systems, and the technical capabilities for taxation also have become more viable. Given that China has entered a new stage of focusing on building Common Prosperity, how can a property tax be absent?
Now that the growth rate of China’s real estate industry is in a downturn, the impulse and justification to push housing prices higher no longer exists, failures of land auction are more frequent, and some leading real estate companies are in deep trouble and ultimate contraction. So, it now seems that a window for property tax reform has opened. For this new round of reform, ordinary people are most practically concerned about their own interests:
Will my city be chosen for the pilot?What exemptions will be granted for my properties?How will my life and cash flow be affected?
• Will my city be chosen for the pilot?
• What exemptions will be granted for my properties?
• How will my life and cash flow be affected?
In the new pilots, we foresee the following: taxation intensity will exceed the existing plans of Shanghai and Chongqing – the scope of exemption will be narrowed; the tax rate may increase slightly, but the overall tax burden will be in the affordable range of taxpayers. The bottom line is that, in the end, once it is in place, the reform plan will likely not arouse strong public opinion. Shanghai and Chongqing, Shenzhen, Hangzhou, Nanjing, Chengdu, and Suzhou are the popular candidates for the pilot cities, and these are places with the highest per capita income, and they are the natural choices for the pilot programs. All these cities have healthy economies, fast population growth, high housing prices and active housing market. As the capital, Beijing needs to maintain stable, plus Beijing has the most stringent property market regulations in the country so the possibility of Beijing being selected is extremely low. New pilot cities will likely be announced at the end of 2021 before the start of a new fiscal year.
The Real Estate Regulation
For some time, the real estate industry has been married to the financial industry, excessive capital has entered the real estate sector, real estate companies continuously increase their financial leverage and liabilities even with the negative signals. In September 2021, Chinese banks began to tighten loans to real estate companies, a move to suffocate the industry, led to a rise in debt default rate that disturbed international and domestic capital markets. China’s 2021 Q3 GDP growth rate is 4.9%, below market expectations. At a time when China’s economy is facing downward pressure and the crisis in real estate industry, the central government still launched a new round of property tax pilot reform in October. What is the takeaway of the policy?
The message is clear: the Chinese government will not loosen its regulation on the sector. Since “Housing Reform” in 1998, China’s real estate industry has experienced a long period of booming growth. Every time China's economy slowed down, real estate played the role of savior. However, the housing illusion must be broken. In the meantime, as a partial adjustment, the banks have been guided to relax loan policies on real estate companies to ensure their reasonable capital needs are met. We should also point out that property tax will not be promoted nationwide in the short term because the central government will continue to be cautious. When a mistake in property tax reform can become a subversive one, we should not forget the ultimate goal of property tax reform is to maintain “stable and healthy development.” Real estate developers and investors should understand the sea change; anyone who dares to surf on the edge of chaos should take their own risk.
With the expectation of property tax, it will be difficult for housing prices in hot real estate markets to rise constantly. With the property tax, the house-buying restrictions in tier-1 and tier-2 cities will remain; without the property tax, selling houses in some tier 3 and tier 4 cities will still be difficult. And for the wealthy class in China, if they have to redirect their attachment to property investment, they won’t leave the money in the bank. Helping them to find other high yield investment channels will be the biggest opportunity in the years to come.
The story of property tax reform in China is a complex and winding road – “feeling for stones to cross the river.” The reforms will not fundamentally change the supply and demand of property for a city, nor will it become a major source of income for local finance in the short term. However, the reform is indeed a key building block of the modern local fiscal system in China.
1. Two terms used for property-related tax are house property tax (HPT) or 房产税 in Chinese and property tax or 房地产税. Literally, property tax has land (地), so it is a tax on architecture and land it is built on. The pilot reform in Shanghai and Chongqing is for HPT, the new round of reform is for property tax.
2. In the planned economy era, housing was allocated to people by the unit they work at very low rent, the allocation is based on conditions like rank, length of service, age, household size etc. As a result, housing was a kind of welfare and in extreme short supply.
