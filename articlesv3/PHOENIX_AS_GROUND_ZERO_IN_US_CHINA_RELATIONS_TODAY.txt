### PHOENIX AS GROUND ZERO IN U.S.-CHINA RELATIONS TODAY

AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide analyses about leadership in the global economy. We work to bring research and analyses to our readers, students, and clients, helping them understand this complex moment in this moment in China’s economic development trajectory. As part of this goal, OGL Chairman Doug Guthrie, together with the Chinese Chamber of Commerce, Arizona, launched a lecture series on “Doing Business with Today’s China.” Hosted at the Thunderbird School of Global Management, where Guthrie serves on the faculty, the series will present the complexities of U.S.-China relations for business leaders today. In addition to the in-person delivery, the lectures will be livestreamed and recorded and posted on the OGL site.
This is a remarkable time for U.S.-China relations. In fact, it might be the most critical moment in the last 50 years. Over five decades ago, in 1972, President Nixon visited the People’s Republic of China, thus opening the door for a period of constructive engagement with the world’s most populous nation.
Deng Xiaoping pushed the relationship deeper, visiting President Carter in 1979, inaugurating Communist China’s new era of “economic opening.” The era of engagement continued to gain momentum during the Clinton presidency, as President Clinton worked to de-link China’s trade status from its human rights record, thus paving the way for Permanent Normal Trade Relations status (PNTR) and China’s entry in World Trade Organization (WTO).
China entered the WTO in 2001, and it would soon become the world’s second largest economy and the U.S.’s largest trading partner. The interdependence between our economies grew over the next decade-plus: American companies like Apple, WalMart, Tesla, and many others became deeply embedded in and dependent upon China’s manufacturing supply chain, and China became the largest exporter of products to the United States. As China’s manufacturing supply chain became more and more sophisticated, American companies grew increasingly dependent upon its largest trading partner.
Relations between our two nations began to take a dark turn with the election of President Trump in 2016. Invoking Section 301 of the U.S. Trade Act of 1974, over the next four years, the Trump administration levied tariffs that would eventually amount to nearly $300 billion. Somewhat ironically (though perhaps not surprisingly), these tariffs did little to harm China or shift manufacturing and purchasing to other venues. Most often these tariffs simply increased prices for U.S. consumers, thus hurting American citizens more than anyone.
Nevertheless, China continued to be blamed for the struggles faced by U.S. consumers. The anti-China rhetoric from the Trump/MAGA faction seems only to have grown over the eight years since President Trump’s election, as the MAGA faction has sought to scapegoat China for the ills of the U.S. economy.
In a recent interview with David Brooks, a columnist withThe New York Times,MAGA guru Steve Bannon noted: “President Trump is a kindhearted person. He’s a people person, right? On China, I think he admires Xi Jinping. But we’re super-hawks. We want to see an elimination of the Chinese Communist Party.”
The anxiety over China and its increasingly powerful economy is not solely the province of MAGA acolytes. Under the Biden administration, Congress passed the Science and Chips Act, delivering subsidies to U.S. producers of high technology hardware, and prohibiting Chinese customers and supply chain partners access to semiconductors. Additionally, there have been growing tensions over Taiwan. And, indeed, these last two issues flow together, as Taiwan is the home to the world’s most powerful and sophisticated chip manufacturing company, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC).
A New Ground Zero
Today, we need a constructive dialogue with so much at stake. Right now, at the Thunderbird School of Global Management at Arizona State University, we believe there is a wonderful opportunity for this constructive dialogue. Thunderbird is the perfect place for this dialogue, because the institution is built on the concept that global engagement creates a better, more constructively engaged world. As one of the early Thunderbird Faculty members, Dr. William Lytle Schurz, used to say, “Borders frequented by trade seldom need soldiers.” Engagement, engagement, engagement.
But it has to be constructive engagement. It has to be the type of engagement where two partners are working hard together, innovating, designing, building a new future and a new economy. Thunderbird is a powerful guide for navigating this type of constructive engagement, and Phoenix is a fascinating place. Now one of the fastest growing cities in the United States, this once sleepy desert town is now home of one of TSMCs largest fabrication investments in the world.
Phoenix truly is at ground zero, with a fast-growing metropolitan economy, one of the world’s most important semiconductor production companies, and the building of three new fabrication productions facilities.
During our most recent China Town Hall meeting, we looked at all these factors and considered the impact on Phoenix and the United States, and what we can learn from TSMC's arrival in Arizona.
