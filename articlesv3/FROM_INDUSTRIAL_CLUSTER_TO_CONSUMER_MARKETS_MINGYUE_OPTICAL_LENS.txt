At On Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy and, in particular, life in China. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. We have written about economic development in China and China’s economic reforms, US-China relations, China’s changing role in the global political economy, and the history and current state of Chinese politics. In this post, we continue our work on the hidden strengths of China’s capitalist economy. Common views often depict China as a weakening economy, hobbled by the issues of weaknesses in the real estate sector or an overly controlling central government in Beijing. In our view, China has struck a remarkable balance between building sophisticated industrial clusters but also gradually building the domestic consumption markets across a number of different sectors and products. This post looks at one specific industrial cluster, eyeglasses in Jiangsu Province’s Danyang City. This article is Part 2 in a series on industrial clusters and consumption markets in Danyang and focuses in particular on Mingyue Optical Lens.
Walking into Danyang Optical Center, it is hard to miss the huge banner for Mingyue Optical Lens Co.,Ltd. when you look up. Mingyue Optical Lens is the second-listed lens company in China (1), and Danyang is its registration location and major operation site.
The founder of Mingyue Optical Lens, Gongwan Xie was born in November 1967, in a poor peasant family in Ruian County. Gongwan started his business from scratch in 1986. With a sack of semi-finished spectacle lenses and frames, he left his hometown alone and went to Northeast China to try his luck. Ruian is now a county-level city under Wenzhou City, Zhejiang Province. In the 1980s and 1990s, many Wenzhou people left their hometown to make money; many started their own businesses. Their footprints were scattered throughout China and around the world. Gongwan was one of them.
In the first few years of his venture, during the day, Gongwan walked through the streets to sell at night, he grinded glass lenses by himself, and finally earned the first bucket of gold in his life and became a ten-thousandaire (2). However, Gongwan was not satisfied. In 1989, he went to Guangzhou to try wholesale business (3), with some 30,000 yuan borrowed from relatives and friends at an interest rate of 3% per month, plus his own savings. Unexpectedly, all his goods were confiscated in Guangzhou due to unlicensed operation and suspected sale of smuggled spectacle frames, he went bankrupt overnight and was in heavy debt.
Such heavy losses did not knock Gongwan down. He stayed in eyewear business and soon opened an eyewear retail store in Nanjing, again, with the help of relatives and friends (4), his family members like his brother Gongxing Xie also joined him. This time, he succeeded. By 1997, Gongwan had accumulated more than 3 million yuan (5).
Surprisingly, however, Gongwan decided to give up retail and set up his own factory to produce lenses. It was a time when the eyewear market was chaotic, especially the quality of lenses, and it was difficult to buy good quality lenses in bulk. Smelling the opportunity, in 2000, Gongwan opened a factory producing resin lenses in Shanghai. In 2002, Gongwan and his younger siblings further expanded production capacity by opening new factories in Shanghai and Danyang. In 2006, Mingyue went upstream to build its own raw material factory.
Besides building factories, Mingyue continues to invest in R&D Partner with Mitsui Chemicals (Japan) and KOC Solution (Korea) to develop polymer materials for lenses;
Team up with domestic institutions such as University of Shanghai for Science and Technology and Changchun Institute of Optics and Mechanics, Chinese Academy of Sciences on optical design of eyewear.
After decades of growth, now Mingyue has become a lens company with in-house production capability in raw material and finished goods, in-house R&D, own intellectual property rights and Mingyue is a China national brand. On December 16, 2021, Mingyue was successfully listed on the Growth Enterprise Market.
Mingyue targets the domestic mid-to-high-end market and has established a nationwide sales and distribution network. As of the end of 2023, Mingyue has 2,717 direct sales customers and 53 distributors, Mingyue products are sold at over 10,000 brick-and-mortar stores. Online, Mingyue has opened its own flagship store on Tmall and Jingdong, it also cooperates with social media Xiaohongshu and Douyin to “Zhongcao” (6).
Someone once asked Gongxing Xie, Gongwan’s younger brother and president of Mingyue, which stage of Mingyue’s development touched him most? Gongxing replied to the period transition from making products to building brand.
Grasping the initiative is a key phrase that has accompanied Mingyue from its inception. Perhaps due to their early experience, the top management team of Mingyue has always had a strong sense of crisis and wants to have more control over their businesses. From wholesale and retail to building own lens factory, then own raw material factory, all meant to take more initiative in business. But the results were not as expected. “We have attached great importance to R&D, our products are not inferior to those of foreign brands, but ours can’t be sold at a better price and even not easy to sell,” Gongwan recalled. Indeed, when the price war became the main theme of peer competition, Mingyue’s situation was even worse. “R&amp;D has increased ourcost, but no return in sales, Shanzhai (copycat) factories at least had some  cost advantage,” Gongwan further commented. Around 2010, Mingyue tried to promote its brand buy running advertisements, but return on investment was low.
At that time, a large part of Mingyue’s business was OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer). Why are products with the same quality sold at a higher price just by adding a foreign logo? Mingyue’s management realized that in order to truly grasping the initiative, being a hidden champion in manufacturing is not enough, it is more important to build a brand that wins the recognition of consumers.
In 2017, Mingyue’s management made a deliberate decision to transform to brand building strategy that shifted the company’s focus from a production orientation to a consumer orientation. Mingyue quickly took a series of measures to implement the Transformation.
Establishing brand position.The first step was hiring Trout & Partners as consultant and partner to help identify Mingyue’s strategic direction through an external perspective. It was a time when consumers paid more attention to the frame when buying glasses rather than lenses, except for a few international brands, domestic lens manufacturers were almost neglected.
Mingyue wants to be the representative of Chinese lenses, making it possible for Chinese people to buy the best quality lenses at a reasonable price.Help consumers to equate Mingyue with lenses and be their first choice when getting glasses.
• Mingyue wants to be the representative of Chinese lenses, making it possible for Chinese people to buy the best quality lenses at a reasonable price.
• Help consumers to equate Mingyue with lenses and be their first choice when getting glasses.
Hiring a brand ambassador.Finding a brand ambassador to endorse Mingyue would elevate the company's national awareness and reputation.
Daoming Chen(陈道明) became the brand ambassador in 2017. During the prime time of Jiangsu Satellite TV, the well-known artist wore a pair of glasses and smiled wisely in front of the screen, conveying the sense of quality of Mingyue lenses to the audience.In 2022, the company signed another brand ambassador, Haoran Liu (刘昊然), to expand its influence on younger consumers. In 2024, the company released Mingyue/Minion co-branded youth myopia prevention and control lenses in cooperation with Universal Pictures.Mingyue’s products and brand ambassadors are frequently featured on mainstream TV channels, major e-commerce platforms, landmarks and public transportation vehicles.

Empower retailers.More than 90% of Mingyue’s products are sold to end users through brick and mortar stores. Empowering these stores is another move in Mingyue’s brand building.
In 2019, Mingyue launched the “10,000 Store Plan” to educate consumers on how to choose lenses and how to protect their eyes by supporting distributors to build specialty stores, store inside a store, Mingyue lens counters, and providing experience props. Mingyue is aiming at building a concept for glasses with Mingyue lenses just like the Intel Inside computers.At the end of 2017, Mingyue began to withdraw from the price war and publicly announced to permanently maintain such practice in 2019. The company believes that price wars will cause the industry falling into Gresham’s Law, i.e., bad money to drive out good money, a vicious circle. In Q2 2023, while e-commerce platforms like Douyin (TikTok is the international version of Douyin) penetrated into eyewear market through price war, Mingyue did not follow the price reduction, but instead, work with retail customers to upgrade product quality services at relatively affordable prices, an effort that allows both Mingyue and its retail customers to maintain a sustainable level of profitability and sales.Mingyue has taken strong measures to maintain its pricing and distribution structure, crack down on cross-region selling and fight against counterfeit goods. The company has set up a team to conduct 365X24 online price monitoring, works with external resources like lawyers and mystery shopping service, and has upgraded product packaging and anti-counterfeiting marks. Through the above measures, Mingyue has become one of the few companies in China that can effectively maintain its pricing structure and manage its distributors.

Having above said, Mingyue’s transformation process is full of pains, and is still being questioned today. Brand building requires not only lots of resource, but also time, all test the will of the management and the strength of the company. In the early stage of transformation, while brand promotion significantly increased operating cost, it did not help to improve short-term results. Mingyue did not fight a price war, but its competitors continued to seize the market through such means. Analysts continue to doubt its business model that spends much more on sales instead of R&D. Despite these challenges and doubts, Mingyue’s management sticks to its brand strategy and their persistence has achieved obvious financial benefits.
The story of Mingyue is a classic one for Wenzhou merchants. Wenzhou is a backwater city on the coast of East China Sea about 200 miles south of Shanghai. Wenzhou is surrounded by mountains and the sea, has a large population in limited arable land. As the locals could not make a good living by farming and fishing, running a business or setting up a workshop became a natural choice. Similarly, due to inconvenient transportation, remote location and lack of economic importance, Wenzhou is not subject to much control by the higher-level government and has relatively relaxed policy environment.
Wenzhou has a long-term business culture. Merchants are an important group of Wenzhounese, their footprints are all over China and around the world. From the founder of Mingyue, we can see some typical characteristics of Wenzhou merchants, such as:
“Four Thousand Spirit” (7) – At the beginning of the reform and opening up, Wenzhou merchants overcame numerous challenges when exploring business opportunities around the country. The entrepreneurial spirit of Wenzhou merchants is summarized as “travel through thousands of mountains and rivers, persuade with thousands of words, try thousands of attempts, and endure thousands of hardships”. The “Four Thousand Spirit” is perfectly embodied in Gongwan’s entrepreneurial experience.Business acumen – Their guts are mostly built on sound business acumen, rather than the gambler mentality. Mingyue’s transition towards branding strategy are made at the hope of success – First, eyewear market in China is so large that it should be able to accommodate a domestic national brand; second, after decades of growth, Mingyue has the capability to have a try. In the words of Gongwan, “Even if we fail, Mingyue won’t die.”Independent thinking – Wenzhou merchants have a strong sense of self-reliance, act on their own judgment and capability. They don’t wait for an ideal opportunity to take action, and they are able to keep up with the times and make changes accordingly. Critical decisions Mingyue has taken, like focusing on the domestic market, transition to branding strategy, and no price wars, are the result of independent judgment by its top management and, in the final analysis, making financial sense to the company.

Mingyue is the perfect combination of the Danyang glasses industry supply chain and Wenzhou entrepreneurship. Its successful listing has played an exemplary role in the upgrading of Danyang’s glasses industry. Mingyue’s “brand + technology” development model provides a good reference for other eyeglass companies in Danyang. Now the capital market has put forward higher expectations for the company. In the eyewear market in China, which is unpredictable and extremely competitive, will Mingyue continue to excel?
