AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide analyses about leadership in the global economy. In this post, Dr. Doug Guthrie, who is a co-founder of OGL, is curating a special series of China Journal entries over the next two weeks as he returns to China for the first time in four years. Dr. Guthrie sets the stage for his trip to China with this first post.
On December 2, 2023, I boarded a Delta Airlines flight bound for Shanghai. It has been four years – almost to the day – since I last set foot in my adopted homeland. The key feature of this trip, however, is that, for 30 years, from June 1989, when I first left the United States to live in Taiwan as a college student, to December 2019, when I left my job as an Apple executive working in China, not a year went by when I did not spend at least some time in China, a place that would seem as much like a home to me as anywhere in the world. Now, it had been four years, and I couldn’t wait to return.
My relationship with China is complicated. China saved my life – or, at least, it gave me a life – and then it almost took it away. Today, we have fallen back into a careful friendship. My feelings about China are deeply personal. As a teenager, I fell in love with China and her people. It was the kind of love that forces you to reimagine your life, your past, and your future. It was more powerful than many relationships I have had, and it shaped me in ways that are usually reserved for your closest loved ones.
As I learned the Chinese language and unlocked thousands of years of history, I became profoundly tied to the struggles China endured in the 19th and 20th centuries. I could recount the important passages in Chinese history more easily than I could detail the history of the United States. I began to feel more aligned with China and its struggles, and less in tune with my home country.
In many ways, China became a safe haven for me, as it allowed me to build a rewarding and prominent professional life far away from the world in which I grew up, allowing me to be connected to something on a level I had never experienced. At first, I was an undergraduate student savant on China. Then, as a graduate student, I lived in China at a critical point in my early scholarship and experienced China’s poverty and chaos from the seat of a rickety one-speed bicycle at a major moment of country-wide transformation. Later, I was a successful academic, administrator, business consultant, corporate executive, and lobbyist who helped introduce the world to a transforming capitalist China.
I lived that life and enjoyed it for more than three decades. Then China broke my heart as I watched it roll back the promise first envisioned 40 years ago. What I learned in that ego- and life-shattering process are lessons that guide my life today as I ponder my own future and consider how Americans can better understand what drives China, and that there is much to gain from understanding its perspective.
As I sat on the plane, it was with a mix of emotions. Five years ago, I felt heartbroken with China’s direction as I prepared to leave, but, for now, I was anxious to get back to this place I had been studying since the early 1990s. During the ride, I read the most recent article in theFinancial Timesabout Huawei’s successful development of its new chip and phone. That article took me back to the intense times I spent with Huawei over the last fifteen years (some of which is describedhere,here, andhere). I thought about how important a strong relationship with China and its leading companies are for US-China relations and for the world. I also slept some on the 16-hour flight and, as always, planned to get lots of writing done. But mostly I just thought about the strange journey my life as a China observer had been over the course of my life.
On the Ground… Finally
Going through customs was efficient and easy. I still remember a time when things like customs and visa checks seemed so painfully inefficient when entering China. But this is a country now that has been transformed in its efficient welcoming of foreign investors and observers of that transformation.
In the cab from the Pudong Airport to my hotel, I was filled with memories dating back nearly three decades. The first time I landed in Shanghai in 1994, I was a poor graduate student, here to explore the economic transformation of Shanghai, hoping it would serve as a window into China’s economic transformation. When I arrived in China in June 1994, there was no Pudong Airport; Pudong’s financial district, Lujiazui, had only one building looking across at the western side of Shanghai. Twenty-five years later, it would be home to three of the 20 tallest buildings in the world. Then, the ride from the Hongqiao Airport to my dorm room at the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences (SASS) on Huahai Middle Road was less eventful. The McDonald’s down the block from SASS was the bustling site where Chinese parents introduced their children to American food and culture. It was also a center for meetings for poor graduate students, and I met many future friends there. Today, foreign flights land at the Pudong Airport, the trek to my hotel drives right past the fabulous Lujiazui, and McDonald’s is no longer here (A 7-11 shop is still here, though, right across from the hotel where I am staying in Puxi).
And now, as I sit in the Kempinski Hotel room writing this, I am still trying to process my feelings. Unable to sleep, I went for a 4 a.m. walk around the neighborhood. At the hotel’s entrance, I chatted with a few young businesspeople, waiting for a cab to take them to the airport to fly to Guangzhou. They were from Greece, in China for 10 days to continue to attract more investment in Greek real estate. Greece has a policy that automatically issues a Residence Visa to anyone who invests at least $250K in Greek real estate, and, according to these young men, their company’s business is booming because of China’s push to build out its presence in Southern Europe and the Middle East. They were very friendly and generous, inviting me to their presentation in the hotel when they return from Guangzhou.
Then one of them said, “I hope we can all keep working with each other. The world seems so tense right now. And I’m almost embarrassed for our own country right now.” (He had both Greek and U.S. passports) “What do you think?” I answered that I too am embarrassed sometimes at the tone of the relations between the U.S. and China over the last several years.” It was a fascinating jetlag-induced, middle-of-the-night conversation.
I am happy to be back in China, and looking forward to a nap.
