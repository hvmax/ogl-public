### Hangzhou: A Smart City Practice

14 February 2021|China, Economic Development
AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy and, in particular, life in China. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. We have sought to advance a conversation about the U.S.-China relationship, and a deep understanding of local economic development in China. We have written a series about the strategic strength oflocal economic development in China’s 2nd and 3rd tier citiesandentrepreneurship in China todayas well as a series aboutChina’s Belt and Road Initiative. More recently, we have written aboutChina’s big tech economyand the companies that are changing Chinese society and the world. This post seeks to extend the conversation over our research on smart cities in China today. – The Editorial Team

AtOn Global Leadership, we spend a lot of time thinking about economic development in China, with a focus on local governments an in particular municipal governments. This work converges with work about smart cities and the ways in which cities become innovative in the development of their urban infrastructure. Hangzhou, the capital of East China’s Zhejiang Province, has been called the e-commerce capital since at least 2010, because it is the home to Alibaba, a leading global e-commerce company. In the years since then, as new technologies – such as cloud computing, big data, Internet of Things and artificial intelligence (AI) – kept developing, Hangzhou had a new goal: to become the smartest city in China, and maybe the smartest city in the world. Today, China’s view of Hangzhou is the view of Hangzhou as a smart city, the Hangzhou City Brain (HCB).
What is the Hangzhou City Brain?
The Hangzhou City Brain (HCB) is a big data platform developed for the Hangzhou Municipal Government to help deliver and manage public infrastructure services. HCB connects data banks of 70-plus government entities, enabling 4,500 APIs that support more than 7.6 million calls per day. HCB has 3,200 data fields; the average daily data collaboration exceeds 120 million. By the end of August 2019, 83.7 billion data records had been collected, and its database is increasing at a rate of over 80 million records every day. Mega data enables HCB to use AI technology to become smarter. Key data points generated through the platform can be presented in real time, allowing city administrators to grasp real world information without delay. In order to build an ecosystem with massive applications, HCB is open to thousands of developers hoping to ride on the HCB bus.
The Making of the Hangzhou City Brain
The HCB project began in April 2016, in an effort to use big data to cope with Hangzhou’s increasingly congested streets. After making headway with traffic, government officials began using HCB for everything from parking cars to healthcare, from air quality monitoring to tourist management. Today, HCB has been extended to cover many aspects of the city’s residents' lives. HCB as a smart city project includes the following elements:

• Digitized infrastructure
• Central processing platform
• Massive applications
• Protocols and agreements
• Evaluation mechanism
1.Building a digital infrastructure– The first step of the HCB project was to digitize Hangzhou’s infrastructure. Hangzhou had built over 20,000 5G base stations by the end of 2020. Other new infrastructure (新基建) projects include a 200,000-server-data center with an investment of ￥15.8 billion ($2.45 billion), gigabit speed internet networks, etc. Numerous cameras, sensors, and metering devices have been installed to raise the digital level of the city’s traditional infrastructure. HCB also aims to break the data barriers between different government organizations. A new government department, The Hangzhou Data Resource Administrative Bureau, was set up in 2017 to push this initiative forward.
2.Constructing a big data platform– HCB is mainly composed of a hub (computing platform, data platform, and algorithm platform) that hosts 11 city department platforms (e.g., traffic control, social security, healthcare, etc.) and 15 district platforms. Being the main operational interfaces of government, these platforms are called Digital Cockpit (数字驾驶舱), composed of functional modules (e.g. machine monitoring, irregularity warning, and maintenance, etc.), daily operation module (e.g. data collection and summary, automatic report generation and AI assisted decision-making, etc.). Digital cockpit converts data into information in figures, charts, and other intuitive images shown in one giant dashboard.
3.Developing applications for daily life scenarios– At this point, HCB has developed 48 applications for scenarios relevant to Hangzhou citizens’ daily lives. For example, "one-click escort" (一键护航) APP was launched for emergency dispatch of special vehicles such as ambulances and fire engines. Thanks to this, APP queued vehicles blocking the road are cleared in advance, and traffic lights are adjusted to green in the driving direction. As a result of this APP, the average driving speed has increased by 50% and transit time has been shortened by 30%.
4.Formulating protocols and agreements– Since 2017, China has published a series of national standards on information system security and network security, which are the basic technical requirements that HCB must comply with. In 2018, China released a series of national standards related to smart cities. Hangzhou City and Zhejiang Province have also drafted local regulations and standards, such as “Hangzhou City Brain Construction & Management Requirements” (2018), “Technical Standard for Multifunctional Smart Lighting Pole (draft for comments)” (2020), etc. However, we don’t see a close connection between these local and national standards on smart cities. The reason might be that Hangzhou is allowed to try innovations first and is not bound by existing non-mandatory standards.
5.Evaluation of the effectiveness of HCB– While HCB’s prime user, Hangzhou Municipal Government ,says it is satisfied with HCB, the public has only seen some fragmented performance information on HCB’s success and it is not from an authoritative third party. The earliest application of the HCB was to reduce traffic jams. Hangzhou media often quote data provided by AMAP (高德地图), a BU of Alibaba, to show the improvements brought about by HCB. In order to let our readers understand the complexity of project evaluation, we have selected two simple criteria with the closest connotation from reports published by AMAP and its competitor Baidu Map (百度地图). Our interpretation is that the data varies, and though we see some improvement based on certain criteria, HCB is just not enough to fundamentally solve the Hangzhou's traffic problems looking at a longer period.
Note: (1) Time and range definition are the same as congestion delay index. (2) While Baidu began to release speed data in 2018, AMAP has stopped revealing speed data since 2019.
Alibaba and the Hangzhou City Brain
Since its inception, HCB has been inseparable from Alibaba, the crown jewel of Hangzhou. The idea of HCB was first proposed by Alibaba Cloud’s technical team in 2016. Alibaba provides the core of HCB – its operating system. HCB’s software system architecture is built on Apsara, Alibaba’s in-house, ultra-large-scale general operating system for cloud computing. Apsara helps Alibaba to handle its peak transaction data during the Double 11 shopping festival every year. According to i-research, the Alibaba Cloud ranks No. 1 in China's IaaS market with a market share of 37%, followed by Tencent Cloud (13.2%), China Telecom (9.7%) and Huawei (9%). The success of HCB is the best advertisement for the technical capabilities of Alibaba Cloud.
While providing substantial support to Alibaba, the Hangzhou government also imposes certain restrictions. In HCB's bidding documents, the Hangzhou government either designates Apsara as a single source of procurement or specifies a software architecture compatible with Apsara, thereby excluding competitors of Alibaba Cloud. In 2019, the Hangzhou Municipal Government established a mixed-ownership company named Hangzhou City Brain Co., Ltd. to run the operation and maintenance of HCB. Two business partners of Alibaba Cloud own 30% of the company and Hangzhou local state-owned capital accounts for 70%. Through such careful arrangement, while acting as a key service provider, Alibaba does not possess HCB data, neither does it participate in the daily operation of HCB. The Hangzhou Municipal Government maintains a delicate balance with Alibaba.
Smart city projects flourished in China in 2018, and it was the first time Alibaba's competitors really joined the race. Alibaba, Tencent, Huawei, and Baidu (known as BATH) are the four most competitive companies in smart city infrastructure at this time. In March 2020, a WeChat public account “AI Zhidao” (AI智道) published the data on local smart city bidding in China from 2015 to 2020.BATH won a total of 117 projects, covering 25 provinces and 44 cities. Its winning bid amount totaled ￥9.8 billion ($1.52 billion). Alibaba and its affiliates ranked third behind Huawei and Tencent. Out of Zhejiang, Alibaba’s glory is not that dazzling.
In the case of Hangzhou City Brain, there are a number of characteristics that are also applicable to other Tier 1 or tier 2 cities in China:
First, the Hangzhou government is resolute in promoting HCB because the city’s top officials have seen the benefits: alleviating the burdensome workload and allowing Hangzhou to lead in the smart city race among Chinese cities.
Second, Chinese society and people have a high degree of acceptance and tolerance of digital life. Like it or not, digitalization has been embedded in people’s lives. In 2020, with the rapid promotion of digital technology represented by health QR codes, many people in China (e.g. the elderly) cannot keep up with the digital pace. How to make HCB more inclusive has become a new task for its developers.
Third, Chinese governments at all levels are investing heavily in smart cities. International Data Corporation (IDC) has predicted that China's smart city market size is US $26.6 billion in 2020 and will maintain a compound growth rate close to 15% until 2023. Different types of cities require different solutions, so there are opportunities for companies other than BATH, if they can find the right angle to penetrate this huge market.
Fourth, while HCB has provided Hangzhou administrators a powerful tool, it is not a panacea. There are many obstacles to overcome, from ensuring data security, avoiding algorithmic discrimination, personal information protection to managing the relationship between the government and tech-giants. A responsive and responsible government takes the challenge. They’d rather just do it with the belief that these difficulties will eventually be resolved. In the future, administrators and smart city builders in Hangzhou need to further explore how to maintain diversity, openness, and balance in their smart city journey.
Local competition is one of the biggest driving forces for the rapid growth of China's economy over the past 42 years. Now smart cities are the track to a new round of competition. While the central government has set the national strategy to build an intelligent and data-driven society, its implementation is bottom-up. For local officials, the smart city tournament is actually a competition on the new economy of cities and their career path. Although Hangzhou has taken the lead in the smart city contest, the race is far from an end. No matter what the final outcome is, the Hangzhou City Brain case has provided a meaningful example for China and people who are pursuing the smart city formula.
