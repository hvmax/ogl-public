Moutai, the Chinese Spirit as a Hint
After the office of the US trade representative released President Joe Biden's 2021 trade agenda report, some Chinese citizens have come to believe that China will have to be prepared to rely much more heavily on the strength of its domestic markets to develop its economy. The view among many netizens is that the new administration in Washington will continue to hold a hard line stance against China and, thus, the exchange of goods between the world’s two largest trading partners will continue to stumble.
So, the question arises: Can China really count on its domestic markets to further boost its economy? The short answer to this question is: it depends. We have written previously about China’s domestic policy of developing the “Dual Circulation System,” a key pillar in the transition from investment-led growth to consumption-led growth, and it is a complex topic. However, if the story of Moutai is at all representative of the consumer market in China, the answer may be YES. However, the story of Moutai in China is not just a story of consumption; it is also a story of local economic development.
China's Most Valuable Company
Moutai, or Maotai (茅台), is the most prominent Chinese Baijiu (spirit) brand. With 97% of its revenue generated from mainland China, the beverage maker's market capitalization surpasses international companies like LVMH, Coca-Cola, Anheuser-Busch InBev, Diageo, and many others.
Moutai is named after the town of the same name Maotai in Renhuai (仁怀), a county level city of Zhunyi city(遵义) in Guizhou Province(贵州). Using Chishui River water that flows through the Maotai town, Moutai is distilled from fermented sorghum with its alcohol content over 50% Vol. The history of liquor making in Maotai town can be traced back to the Western Han Dynasty(西汉)2000 years ago, but full-scale production began in the Qing Dynasty(清朝).
Moutai built its reputation after winning a gold medal at the 1915 Panama-Pacific Expo in San Francisco. Today, Moutai is as famous as Scotland whisky and Cognac brandy. But Moutai also has a “red” gene: During the Long March in 1935, Moutai was used for disinfection and drinking when the Red Army stopped by the Maotai town. After the establishment of The People’s Republic of China, Moutai often appeared at government banquets as “the National Spirit”. Premier Zhou Enlai (周恩来) made toasts with Moutai when receiving the U.S. President Nixon and Japanese Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka (田中角栄) in 1972. When Chinese President Xi Jinping visited the U.S. in 2013, he also brought Moutai to a toast with President Barack Obama. So there is both history and Chinese nationalism tied up with this product.
Kweichow Moutai Co., Ltd (Kweichow Moutai), the company producing Moutai, is China's largest listed company by market capitalization. With a gross profit margin of over 90%, Kweichow Moutai has profitability that greatly exceeds the industry average, and its ROE has remained over 30%. In past decade, the company has maintained steady and positive growth even during the downturn period of the Baijiu industry caused by President Xi’s anti-corruption campaign. In sum, Kweichow Moutai is an outstanding blue-chip stock in China's stock market.
A Luxury Brand of the Chinese, by the Chinese and for the Chinese
As the Chinese population become major buyers of luxury goods in the global economy, one question is: where are their own luxury brands within the hierarchy of luxury goods? To be sure, with hundreds of millions of fans, Moutai has an overwhelming brand appeal and popularity in China. But Moutai also has these four typical characteristics of a luxury brand:
High quality – From the brewing environment to the brewing process, to taste and user experience, Moutai has shown a higher quality than peer Baijiu brands.High price – The most popular item of Moutai on the market is 53° Feitian Moutai (飞天茅台) in 500ml. The ex-factory price of Feitian is ￥969 ($149) per bottle, and the official suggested retail price is ￥1,499 ($230). Due to tight supply and stocking by merchants, the average market selling price of Feitian in 2020 exceeded ￥2,500 ($385), which is higher than median of the average monthly disposable income of China in 2020 (￥2,295).Scarcity – Numerous official and unofficial attempts to replicate Moutai have failed. It is widely believed that Moutai can only be made at Kweichow Moutai, because of the special microorganisms from local environment and its unique formula. According to the brewer's own estimates, Moutai supply can only meet one-third of the market demand. The output of Moutai will remain stable at around 60 million bottles (500 ml/bottle) per year for a long period, so Moutai’s short supply will continue.Brand connotation – Moutai has witnessed a series of major historical events in the People's Republic of China, the Geneva Conference (1954), President Nixon’s visit to China (1972), the return of Hong Kong and Macau (1997,1999), the Beijing Olympics (2008), the Shanghai World Expo (2010). These events have established Moutai's status as the "National Spirit" among the Chinese people.

These events have established Moutai's status as the "National Spirit" among the Chinese people.
Although Moutai lacks international recognition, it has become a luxury brand exclusively for China. The consumption pattern of Moutai typically represents some typical Chinese consumption styles:
Consumption for face – Many Chinese luxury consumers spend money for the sake of "showing off" and "saving face". Once a spirit for senior officials, Moutai now remains a symbol of identity and status for the wealthy business people and middle class. Drinking Moutai in a banquet is not for alcohol, it is for the face of the people you are dining with.Consumption as gifts – China is an acquaintance society. Most people buy Moutai as gifts and the people who drink Moutai don’t need to queue for hours for a bottle. While Moutai has disappeared from official consumption, it has never been absent from gift list. Moutai at the airport duty-free shop is a suitable gift for those who travel to China.

3. Consumption with herd mentality – The reflection of the collectivism of the Chinese in consumption habit is following the herd. Many consumers buy Moutai only to join the queue, they believe that there must be a reason for a line being that long.
Chinese Baijiu consumers generally believe that that older Moutai tastes better. With strong price appreciation expectation, the spirit has moved from its consumer goods identity to a low threshold investment and collection target. These days, more and more people have joined the army of Moutai collectors. Maotai is not just a spirit; it's a piece of Chinese culture, wrapping together history, national pride, and the dream that many Chinese share of getting richer.
Moutai and Local Economic Development
We have written previously abouteconomic development in Guizhou, and, alongside data centers, the story of Moutai also plays a prominent role in that narrative. Unlike most provinces in central and western China, the economic development of Guizhou Province is relatively balanced. One important reason is that the Moutai Group (the parent and holding company of Kweichow Moutai) is in Zunyi City. The economy of Zunyi is almost on par with that of Guiyang, the capital city of Guizhou. Moutai is so important to Guizhou that the annual output of Moutai has always been included in the Guizhou Statistical Yearbook as one of the main indicators of national economic and social development. In 2020, among the 88 counties (cities, districts) of Guizhou Province, the GDP of Renhuai (county level city where Moutai Group is headquartered), ranks the first with at ￥136.4 billion.
In recent years, the debt situation of Guizhou has remained a big concern, especially after 2018 with debt default issues arising there. By the end of 2020, the debt balance of the Guizhou Provincial Government was ￥1.099 trillion. Guizhou’s local tax revenue is mainly supported by traditional industries such as Baijiu, tobacco, coal, etc. (Emerging industries like big data are still at early stages of development, so they cannot make meaningful financial contributions.) Due to frequent debt defaults, the Guizhou government has felt a good deal of pressure refinancing its bonds. As a result, the Moutai Group has to play a role. The long-term investment value of Kweichow Moutai and the expectation of its rising stock price has made Moutai' s equity a key collateral and a source of funding.
At the end of 2019, following the direction of the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of Guizhou Province (GSASAC), the Moutai Group transferred 50.24 million Kweichow Moutai shares (4% of its total shares) at a market value of approximately ￥59 billion to Guizhou State-owned Capital Operation Co., Ltd. (GSCOC). After this free transfer, GSCOC reduced its holdings of Kweichow Moutai shares from 4% to 0.68% and obtained more than ￥65 billion from the stock market. One year later, again at the direction of GSASAC, the Moutai Group transferred another 50.24 million shares of Moutai stocks worth ￥92.5 billion to GSCOC free of charge.
The Moutai Group has also played an important role in the infrastructure construction of Guizhou Province. In September 2020, for the first time in the company's history, the Moutai Group issued a ￥15 billion bond to invest in Guizhou Expressway Group Co., Ltd. (GEGC), which had lost ￥1.9 billion in the first half of 2020. By the end of 2019, the miles of expressway built by GEGC reached 3,849 kilometers, about 55% of the total mileage of expressways in all of Guizhou. As of June 30, 2020, GEGC's total liability is ￥289.4 billion, and its debt-to-asset ratio was 69.98%. In addition, Zunyi Moutai Airport is a subsidiary of Moutai Group with 70% of ownership. Total investment of the airport is ￥2.43 billion, a much needed infusion of capital, as the airport had suffered continuous losses after the airport started operation in October 2017. Thus, thanks to the excellent performance of Kweichow Moutai in the stock market, the Moutai Group has actually become another financial platform of the Guizhou Provincial Government.
The Future of Moutai
The younger generations in China seem less inclined to drink Baijiu, preferring instead beverages with lower alcoholic content, such as beer, cocktails, and fruit wine. The young people who do snap up Moutai on e-commerce platforms typically only regard Moutai as a gift to the elders or a way to make some extra money through reselling. As for the overseas markets, the vast majority of Moutai's consumption is still among the Chinese community. But the Moutai Group is not that worried. Moutai has made its fortune from a single market – China and it has been in short supply in that market, so prospects for growth still look strong.
In planning for the next price increase, there are plans for this traditional Chinese product to go young and go global. In 2021, Moutai released an advertising song"Oh It's Moutai"on social media. Young protagonists and the modern mix and match style highlight the song's positioning - being youthful and going global. It will be interesting to follow the way The Moutai Group tackles these markets as it continues to evolve as a product.
