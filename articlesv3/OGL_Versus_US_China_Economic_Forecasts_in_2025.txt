AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy and, in particular, life in China. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. We have sought to advance a conversation about the U.S.-China relationship, and a deep understanding of local economic development in China. OGL Versus, our latest feature, allows us to write briefly about the interesting competition between the U.S. and China, and offer some additional readings to take this conversation to even deeper levels. In our latest post, we briefly examine the 2025 economic forecasts for both countries.
The global economic outlook for 2025 is clouded by uncertainty, as sluggish growth in major economies and disruptive trade dynamics threaten stability.
In the U.S., persistent inflation, elevated interest rates, and political turbulence could weigh on consumer confidence and business investment, slowing economic momentum. Meanwhile, China grapples with a deepening real estate crisis, weak domestic demand, and mounting tensions with Western markets—disruptions that could send shockwaves through global supply chains.
As these economic giants struggle against mounting headwinds, emerging markets stand at a crossroads—some poised to benefit from shifting trade flows, while others face heightened financial volatility. With geopolitical risks and economic realignments reshaping the global landscape, 2025 is set to be a defining year for growth and stability.
Here, we compare the status of the world’s two largest economies as they navigate the challenges ahead.
United States.A combination of factors -- many of them driven by Trump administration policies -- suggests a challenging economic environment for the U.S. in 2025. The convergence of rising inflation, potential recession, trade tensions, and market volatility underscores the need for careful monitoring and adaptive economic strategies in the months ahead.
The U.S. economic outlook for the remainder of the year is marked by significant uncertainty. The outlook from Point72 Asset Management, a global investment firm, is that economic growth in the United States in the second half of the year will fall from 2.5% to 1.5%—though unemployment will also fall because of a tighter labor force.
That insight is echoed by Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, both of which announced in early March that they were lowering their 2025 economic forecasts for the U.S. given the tariffs and the tight labor market. Morgan Stanley lowered its GDP-growth forecast from 1.9% to 1.5% for 2025, and Goldman Sachs downgraded its growth forecast to 1.7%, from 2.2%, and raised its 12-month recession probability from 15% to 20%.
In the first week of March, theAtlanta Fed's GDPNow modelprojected -2.8% GDP growth for the first quarter of 2025 in the U.S. Later in the week, the Fed updated that number to -2.4%.
China. In a report presented the first week of March, Chinese Premier Li Qiang announced that his nation was keeping its economic growth target at about 5% for 2025, despite significant challenges both internally and externally. That rosy forecast was met with some skepticism, but others see a solid performance ahead for China in 2025.
The International Monetary Fund increased its forecast for Chinese growth to 4.6% for 2025 and by four-tenths of a percentage point to 4.5% for 2026. This reflects its belief China has some increased momentum due to fiscal measures.
Critical Factors:
The Trump administration has imposed tariffs on imports from Canada, Mexico, and China, and on selected products such as steel. These measures have led to trade tensions, increased consumer prices, and potential disruptions in manufacturing jobs.Signs of a softening labor market and reduced government spending have heightened fears of an impending recession.Inflation has escalated from 2.4% in September 2024 to 3% in January 2025, raising concerns about a potential Federal Reserve interest rate hike.Immigration policies could have a chilling effect Curbs on migration and protectionist policies will weigh on potential output.

China must continue its policies strengthening its domestic marketplace so it can become less dependent on global trade. Escalating trade tensions with the United States pose further challenges in 2025, as both nations have imposed tariffs on each other’s imports.China’s property sector continues to face significant difficulties and a potential liquidity crisis in China’s real estate industry.Youth unemployment remains a key concern, with official estimates indicating a rate of 16.1% in November 2024, though some believe it to be higher.

United States:“Tariffs cannot be positive, I mean, it's a tax. And you can imagine tit for tat if the U.S. does something—it implements a tax on somebody—somebody else is going to perhaps raise the stakes and raise their tax back. Taxes are never positive,” said Steve Cohen, CEO of Point72 Asset Management and owner of the New York Mets baseball team. "On top of that, we have slowing immigration, which means the labor force will not grow as rapidly as…over the last five years.”
China: “The broader picture is very much in line with what you described, which is that the Chinese economy needs to pivot to a more domestically driven engine of growth. This has not happened yet,” said Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, economic counselor and director of the IMF’s Research Department. “Even the 2024 numbers, for instance, that were just announced show that the Chinese economy has benefited substantially from an improvement in its trade and external balance. So some of the growth is coming from good performance on the external sector. And we see that as something that is increasingly going to become difficult for the Chinese economy for a very simple reason. China is a very large economy, and it cannot just rely on the rest of the world to fuel its own domestic growth.”
