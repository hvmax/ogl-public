On Global Leadership’s regular feature OGL Real Time presents our up-to-the-minute insights on current news and events. We hope these breaking news insights from our OGL team members will help illuminate the events of the day and provide the depth needed to understand global political, economic, and cultural transitions and transformations. In this post, we consider China’s upcoming Third Plenary Sessions, which will be held July 15-18. We examine a variety of important issues raised by this meeting, taking into account our own views as well as what the OGL team in China reads and hears in local media, social media and popular sentiment.
How did the country react when China’s Politburo finally announced the date for the country’s much-anticipated Third Plenary Sessions, which will take place July 15-18, six months later than expected?
The upcoming Third Plenary Session of the 20th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) has not caught too many discussions on social media, so far. The people talking about the meeting most are professionals, such as financial media, securities analysts, etc. However, although netizens aren’t discussing the Third Plenary Session much, they do have expectations.
Hu Xijin, the former chief editor ofThe Global Times, is one of China's most influential media people, with nearly 25 million followers on his Weibo account. Figure 1 lists his determination of domestic hot topics that might end up being part of the Third Plenary's discussions. It is our view that whether decisions made by the Third Plenary Session will resonate with netizens will depend on whether the issues of greatest concern to Chinese society are addressed. Generally speaking, the economy is undoubtedly the topic that netizens are most concerned about, as the state of the economy is related to their vital interests. Beyond the economy, however, here are some of the topics Chinese citizens seem most concerned with in the weeks leading up t0 the Third Plenary Session.
Hot topic 1 - The knife attack at a school bus stop in Suzhou. The perpetrator is an unemployed person who came to Suzhou from another community. Why did he do this? The brawl over the attack, which included Japanese victims, reflects the growing irritability and divisions in China's social media.Hot topic 2 - The suicide of Ms. Zheng, a 30-year-old female employee of CICC (China's Morgan Stanley). Under the multiple blows of mortgage pressure and salary cuts in the industry, a gold-collar class that has been very good since her student days is just as fragile. There is little sympathy in the emotion of most netizens for this. They believe that people in the financial and securities industry are paid high salaries that do not match their contributions to the society. The feeling comes from a sense of helplessness under the financial pressures in today's China. The looming question is what will ordinary people do if even the elite can't cope with such pressure?Hot topic 3 - Mr. Hu's personal stock trading performance. Hu entered the stock market after the CPC Politburo meeting held in July 2023 proposed to "activate the capital market and boost investor confidence". His loss in stock trading is more than 10% in a year. While Chinese investors are suffering, other markets around the world have repeatedly hit new highs. In China, there are 220 million investors in the stock market and more than 700 million fund investors. After 2007, China's stock market has not brought returns to investors in general, and investors' losses are jokingly referred to as financial consumption. The sluggishness of the stock market has obviously dragged down China's economy, especially impacting the willingness of people to spend.

The Third Plenary Sessions are very important in China’s political system. However, most people outside of China do not understand the importance or function of these meetings. Please give us a little background on their importance.
Formally, when a new party assembly is convened, its 1st and 2nd plenums immediately follow. The 1st plenum nominates the party leadership, and the 2nd plenum presents the list of names for other top government positions for the People’s Congress to confirm. The 3rd plenum is usually a work session that issues guidance for the nation’s political and economic agendas going forward. It can be a policy proposal that directs activities for the next 5-10 years (in this case 2035 outlook).
Since the reform and opening-up in 1978, the third plenary sessions of past CPC central committees have provided the public with information to judge the government's policies from each generation of CPC leadership, through discussion topics, decisions made, measures to take and signals released.
This time it’s especially critical because extensive and profound changes have taken place domestically and internationally：
China has completed the first Centenary Goal and eradicated absolute poverty;The Chinese population has entered a stage of negative growth;China is facing the largest geopolitical contest ever seen in human history (1);And China is going global and has increasing interests outside its national borders.
1. China has completed the first Centenary Goal and eradicated absolute poverty;
2. The Chinese population has entered a stage of negative growth;
3. China is facing the largest geopolitical contest ever seen in human history (1);
4. And China is going global and has increasing interests outside its national borders.
The postponed Third Plenary Session is likely to take more time to reach consensus and balance under these challenging circumstances, such as prioritizing goals and focal points, introducing the working mechanism, methods of implementation, and setting the timetable and roadmap for the session's reform plan.
China’s central system determines policy and directs resources -- and business revolves around resources.  Because of the directional nature, these are the areas people are watching closely.
Various media reports have conjectured that the upcoming meeting will focus on broad issues of “deepening the reforms”. Others have suggested that there are many specific issues that require immediate attention and policy guidance. What is OGL Team’s sense of where the focus will be?
The document adopted at the Third Plenary Session of the 18th CPC Central Committee in 2013 has 16 parts, 60 specific tasks and 336 major measures, a comprehensive and systematic document for reform. The 20th CPC National Congress set the goal to realize the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation through a Chinese path to modernization in a two-step strategic plan:
Basically, realize socialist modernization from 2020 through 2035Build China into a great modern socialist country that is prosperous, strong, democratic, culturally advanced, harmonious and beautiful from 2035 through the middle of this century. CPC is aware of the negative externality and the geopolitics is hostile which reinforces top leaders' position and promotes nationalism on social media. Beijing has laid out some new slogans like “to construct a high level socialistic market economy system” (构建高水平社会主义市场经济体制) and “New Quality Productive Forces” (新质生产力). We hope the meeting will define “high level” and set clear guidance to local governments on how to develop new quality productive forces while not repeating mistakes such as debt issues, the real estate bubble, duplicative construction and over capacity, which impact China today.
1. Basically, realize socialist modernization from 2020 through 2035
2. Build China into a great modern socialist country that is prosperous, strong, democratic, culturally advanced, harmonious and beautiful from 2035 through the middle of this century. CPC is aware of the negative externality and the geopolitics is hostile which reinforces top leaders' position and promotes nationalism on social media. Beijing has laid out some new slogans like “to construct a high level socialistic market economy system” (构建高水平社会主义市场经济体制) and “New Quality Productive Forces” (新质生产力). We hope the meeting will define “high level” and set clear guidance to local governments on how to develop new quality productive forces while not repeating mistakes such as debt issues, the real estate bubble, duplicative construction and over capacity, which impact China today.
We estimate that this time, the development goal in 2035 will be further refined, and some new reform measures will be adopted, such as tax reform, market-based allocation of factors of production like land and data. Overall, we estimate there will be no more new reform measures than in 2013, and the focus will be on the refinement and adjustment of reform measures that have already been issued, with a focus on stronger implementation.
For example, the focus could be on common prosperity, regional integration from local pilots to nationwide implementation, and reform of financial supervision to meet the needs of current and future development. A much-talked-about reform is in implementing the consumption tax, shifting from collection at the production end to collection at the consumption side, and from a central tax to a shared tax between the local government and the central government.
For example, the consumption tax on Moutai (most famous Chinese liquor) is now levied in Guizhou Province, 100% handed over to the central government, and is later returned back to Guizhou. After the reform, the consumption tax would be levied in Beijing, Guangdong and other consumption places, so that local governments in rich areas will have more incentive to encourage consumption. China produces the most consumption data in the world every year. How Beijing defines data security and manages the flow of data will have a direct impact on the investments of multinational companies in China.
One issue that has been discussed widely is the need to steer the economy toward “high-quality development.” What exactly does “high quality development” mean? What are the key areas that China needs to press forward with in the development of a world leading economy?
There has been a lot of talk about high-quality development over the last few months, dating back to the Two Sessions meetings in March of 2024. In that event, President Xi called for reforms that would support his economic strategy of high quality development. It is not surprising, therefore, that high-quality development is anticipated as being an important topic of the upcoming Third Plenary Session. But whatishigh-quality development?
The notion of high-quality development signals a shift away from emphasizing China’s strength and reputation as the world’s largest manufacturing supply chain, a supply chain built on a deep, cheap labor pool. Over the course of four decades, China has produced goods for the world with a migrant labor force of about 300 million. It has also built a powerful and technologically advanced and integrated manufacturing supply chain that has been crucial for companies like Walmart, Apple and Tesla. However, it is now viewed as important by President Xi that China continue to focus and grow based on much more technologically advanced and sophisticated products and production processes than simply growth based on the size of the labor force.
Instead of growth through volume production, high-quality development focuses on issues like innovation in products and in production processes. It will focus on coordination, where China’s local leaders will be encouraged to collaborate across regions, markets and even internationally. High-quality development will emphasize green development, where local governments and local economic actors will be encouraged to think about the harmonious coordination between humans and nature. And it will emphasize technology infused growth, working toward cutting-edge innovative solutions to build new, efficient systems and production processes.
Is this just a lot of talk, or is China actually in a position to make a transition to high-quality development? Our view is that China is in a strong position. Indeed, this approach to economic development has already been well underway for the last decade, and local governments and economic actors have been laying the groundwork for this transition for several years now. It is not by accident or chance that China has become a leader in a variety of areas related to President Xi’s notion of high-quality production. Of the top solar panel producers in the world, the top five are Chinese companies; 56% of the world’s EV battery market is supplied by Chinese EV battery producers; 80% of the world’s solar panels come from China. This type of development does not happen overnight.
In any case, it will be interesting to see the ways in which the Third Plenum approaches this issue. Our view, however, is that, if there will be reforms directly and explicitly tied to “high quality development,” they will solidify practices that have been tested in the market for the last decade. This has been the method of development in China for the last four decades: “feeling for stones to cross the river” [摸石过河]. You see the riverbank you want to get to (high-quality development); you feel for stones to get there; you experiment, you test, you find a stable set of stones to stand on; then you build polity to support that path.
Bonus Question: In the short time since the Biden-Trump presidential debate, we have already seen significant news depicting China’s skepticism of the United States system. How are people inside of China viewing the U.S. presidential debate? Are Chinese citizens worried about the stability of the United States?
As can be seen from the above table, events such as the U.S. presidential election have received the attention of professionals like Hu Xijin, but not ordinary netizens. 2024 is the sixth year of the U.S.-China trade war, and Chinese netizens seem to have given up on illusions about American politicians. They have realized that the dire state of Sino-U.S. relations will last for decades. Some people are gloating that the United States can only nominate presidential candidates like Biden and Trump, who are no different to netizens.
Former Ambassador to the United States Cui Tiankai spoke about China-U.S. relations at the 2021 International Situation and China Diplomacy Symposium this way:“The current situation of China-U.S. relations will continue for quite a long time. The United States will not willingly accept the rise of a great power with very different social systems, ideologies, cultural traditions and even races. Moreover, there is a racist element in the U.S. policy towards China... The United States is bound to do everything possible to suppress, contain, divide and encircle China without even a bottom line. In this regard, we must have a sober mind and be fully prepared to deal with the future twists and turns, turbulence and even the "roller coaster" scenario of Sino-U.S. relations."(2) For Beijing, Biden is “twists and turns” and Trump is a "roller coaster".
Most Chinese netizens still believe that the United States is a resilient superpower and is stronger than China. Chinese netizens hope that the two countries can maintain good relations. At the same time, if the relationship between the two countries continues to deteriorate, the influence of American products, American brands, and American culture will continue to decline in China. The worse the relationship between China and the United States, the stronger the netizens' support to Beijing.
