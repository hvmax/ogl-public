AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. Several of us have advised companies and taught about leadership over theyears, and we have developed atheoryof leadership that takes us away from the charismatic leader to the person on the ground fighting for the team, community, or family. In this post, we seek to continue our advancement of a view of everyday leadership. – The Editorial Team
Dov Gelman is one of my oldest friends. We were outsiders in a very conservative suburb of Pittsburgh in the 1970s. In Sloan Elementary School, Dov was the only Jewish kid and I was the only Quaker. We found friendship in our marginal experiences. Our lives went separate directions, occasionally intersecting at various points, but finally came back together in middle age. What I realized in our calls in recent years was that Dov exemplifiedeveryday leadership, a new theory of leadership I have begun to flesh out.
Our approach to everyday leadership was forged in the context of leadership teaching in business school classrooms. Business school teaching focused on training the best and the brightest to be more charismatic, have vision, and be bold. There was little emphasis on listening, empathy, or caring for others.
InEveryday Leadership, we believe leaders are forged in the day-to-day work of organizations. They understand human complexity and operational dynamics. More importantly, everyday leaders know themselves and are sensitive to the people around them and how their presence shapes and influences a room. They know how to humbly listen and serve. The anchors of our framework are organized around five key pillars: complexity and alignment, humility and being wrong, democracy, introspection, and creativity.
As Dov and I have caught up over time, I have been inspired by the trajectory of his life and how it exemplifies our view of everyday leadership. After college, he went to work in the impoverished neighborhoods of Chicago, working to transform the lives of at-risk youth. Later, he moved to Israel, served in the Jerusalem Border Police, and developed a view of what might best serve his adopted homeland. He and his wife built a nonprofit organization focused on strengthening kindergartens and elementary schools for disadvantaged children in Israel. On the side, based on his military experiences, he was recruited to work for a top-tier executive security company. Here is one example of his everyday leadership story.
Dov: Humbly Leading at Dawn
In March of 2020, Dov was worried that the coronavirus pandemic would hit his nonprofit work hard. Just weeks into the pandemic, contributions had slowed to a trickle. And who knew how long travel restrictions would keep him from visiting the projects his organization was sponsoring in Israel? It was a welcome diversion when he fielded a call from a security company that frequently contracted with the federal government.
The caller asked if Dov could come to Georgia to help stand up a hotel for asymptomatic passengers from a stranded cruise ship. The pandemic refugees would be coming for sanctuary and quarantine, and the hotel would be the first of its kind. The government hoped to make it a model for similar guesthouses for asymptomatic virus carriers.
The caller wanted Dov to be one of the guards patrolling the hotel to keep its guests safe from harm. Dov politely deferred, explaining that standing a post was perhaps not the best use of his skills. He wanted to help, but perhaps he should be put in charge of the team of former Marines, soldiers, and private security guards being engaged for the operation. Dov has an innate ability to sound confident and exude experience while listening deeply. His presentation of self comes across as quiet confidence. Convinced, the caller asked Dov to take on the role of site lead responsible for leading the guard force and liaising with various government agency representatives. Dov agreed to do it, and the man promised Dov could write the book on how to establish a coronavirus hotel.
Upon arrival, Dov knew almost immediately that he was surrounded by talent in his guard force, but were they the right talent? One day, sitting in the command trailer, he heard the men talking on the radio. They were using military jargon to describe their situations. Along with their language, Dov could tell they had brought their military mentality with them. He recognized immediately that this way of thinking would be detrimental to the assignment. Like Dov, they all had military backgrounds, but he worried that they didn’t understand who their customers were.

“They were looking for terrorist threats,” Dov explained, noting they needed to be caretakers not combat experts. “I said to them, ‘guys, we’re not in Afghanistan. This is a hotel in Georgia. We are not guarding prisoners. We’ve been hired as executive protection for VIPs. We’re more like a concierge service or doormen. We have to take care of these people. Everyone who is authorized to come into our perimeter are honored guests.’”
Dov flipped the script on his men, establishing a new model and tracking the details in a notebook so the next team wouldn’t have to struggle setting up a hotel and its security. To ensure the message was shared up and down the ladder, Dov started doing spot checks on the team, showing up at odd hours to make sure everyone knew their roles and responsibilities. He regularly reminded them that the culture they had to build was one in which they thought first about serving and caring for people.
One morning, waking an hour early to walk the perimeter, Dov came upon one of the younger guards at the hotel's front gate. It was lonely work, away from the guests and his fellow guards, but the position was also a place that was exceptionally exposed to the public. They had chosen friendly and accommodating guards for that role.
Early in their conversation, Dov realized the young man was having a difficult time personally. His mother had been diagnosed with an aggressive form of dementia just as the pandemic hit, and the threat of illness and death were far too real for him. Worrying about his mother, he was swallowed up by the darkness every night, always alone.
Dov knew he needed guidance, a listening ear, and a purpose to offset being so far away from his mother. He felt it was his responsibility to visit the young guard as the birds welcomed the dawn. The integrity of the team, the fulfillment of the contract, and the meeting of clients’ needs demanded his presence. Most of all, it helped give some peace to the young soldier.
Those morning talks weren’t part of the original game plan. They weren’t even a part of walking the perimeter. What they were was an example of humble, introspective, and creative leadership. InEveryday Leadership, that kind of liberated humility distinguishes itself from mere modesty. Dov was deciding what was beneficial to the organization and the guard at the same time, balancing the complexity of tasks and finding a solution that tested him but also resulted in superior performance and productivity.

“You have to pay the price for leadership, and in paying the price, that’s where the magic can happen,” says Dov. “I had such great team leaders beneath me on the day and night shifts, so I was free to interact with the guys and take care of them. I started bringing a pack of cigarettes around, a Gatorade, or candy, just something small to give them. I was seeing if everyone was doing their jobs and guarding the perimeter, but really it was a chance to get to know everyone, take their measure, and build their leadership skills. And just let them know I cared.”
Dov was not focused on being the big, bold, commanding leader. He has never been focused on climbing a corporate hierarchy or adhering to the trappings of a typical leadership trajectory. Instead, he has been focused on making the world a better place, person by person, brick by brick, helping those around him in whatever way he can. He was focused on learning everything he could about everyone on his team so he personally could help them be the best they could be. That is everyday leadership in its essence.
A final personal note. One of the secrets about leadership professors in business schools is that while we teach leadership and opine on the skills that make for great leaders, the reality is that most of us have little experience with actual leadership. This came home to me about a decade ago when I jumped from the classroom into a leadership role as dean of a business school. I had spent my life studying, researching, and teaching about leadership but had never really led a large organization. Suddenly, I was the head of a $100 million operation with 240 people reporting to me. I wanted to be bold,
In the end, I failed in that role because I was not humble enough; I did not listen enough; I did not understand the needs of the people around me. I didn’t walk the halls enough to check in on people and let them know I cared about who they were and what they were feeling. Looking back, I wish I would have had the everyday leadership instincts that come so naturally to Dov Gelman.
