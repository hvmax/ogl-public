### Huawei's Surprise Launch & What it Means for the Chinese Economy

19 September 2023
AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy and, in particular, life and economic development in China. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. We have written about economic development in China and China’s economic reforms, U.S.-China relations, China’s changing role in the global political economy, and the history and current state of Chinese politics. In this post and the next, we examine high-profile developments relating to two major global corporations – Huawei and Apple. In the last two weeks, both corporations have been in the news for major developments regarding their corporate presence in China. In this post, we examine what the surprise launch of Huawei’s new Mate 60 Pro means for China’s evolving economy and what these events suggest about China’s changing role in the global geopolitical system.
Part I: Huawei's Surprise Launch & What it Means for the Chinese Economy
By The On Global Leadership Team
The first week of September 2023 was a significant one for two electronics giants as they relate to China -- Huawei and Apple. In the past weeks, nearly every major news outlet has written about the the successes and challenges these two corporations face and will continue to face while operating in China. The two corporations are very important for the global economy in general but also for US-China relations, and economic relationship between the world’s two largest trading partners. In this post, we address the Huawei case, and in a second post, we will address the case of Apple in China.
The Huawei Launch
This latest chapter begins with Huawei's launch of the Mate 60 Pro. Some considered it significant, while others considered it just another phone launch. Our own view is the following: this launch was an important event for Huawei as a company specifically and for China’s growth and development as an economic force in the global economic system. But more than this, beyond global economics and trade, Huawei’s surprise launch was a critical event in terms of US-China relations.
Let's put this Huawei moment into a little historical context. We have written about the history of Huawei in previous posts (e.g.,hereandhere), so we won’t go into detail here, but the basic narrative is this: Huawei is a homegrown Chinese multinational, and in its four decades of existence it has grown into a global powerhouse.
Founded in 1987 by Ren Zhengfei, Huawei made its first impact in the global telecommunications switching industry. In those early days, which were also the early days of public access to the Internet, Ren built his startup’s presence on two key insights: (1) the public usage of this new platform called the Internet would be big; and (2) for early-stage developing nations – which included parts of China – the lack of an advanced telecommunications infrastructure would mean that there was significant opportunity for a company that could provide switching technology for developing nations.
From switches to the building of telecommunications networks and eventually handsets, within three decades, Huawei had become a powerhouse in the electronics sector. In 2020, Huawei surpassed Apple and Samsung, for a time, holding the position as the largest shipper of smartphones worldwide. From many angles, the company is absolutely a success story, especially given its origins as a homegrown private Chinese corporation.
The company’s trajectory has not been without controversy, particularly with respect to its relationship with the United States. Huawei has long been lambasted for being too close to the Chinese government. Despite the fact that Huawei’s origins and history are as a wholly private corporate entity – the Chinese government does not exercise the direct strategic managerial control it exercises over State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) – there have been decades of allegations surrounding Mr. Ren’s close ties to the Communist Party and the Chinese government. As a result, Huawei has been targeted by the U.S. Government. Deals have been scuttled – 3Com (2008), Sprint Nortel (2009), and it had an “Entity List” designation (2019) hurt the company further; equipment sales have been banned in the U.S. and to companies doing business with U.S. partners. Last year, 2022, was a rough year for the Chinese juggernaut, as it saw a double-digit decline in smartphone sales for the first time in decades. The company seemed further hurt by the United States' aggressive bans on chipmaking in China and for Chinese companies like Huawei.
But now Huawei is back. The company’s launch of the Mate 60 Pro – during U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Riamondo’s visit – caught the world by storm. On the surface, it appears that, while Huawei has been hurt by global regulatory and trade issues, the company has been quietly building its own internal components that would allow it to operate independent of U.S. chip suppliers and further potential bans. While the bans may have hurt the company in the short run, they also pushed it to deeper internal innovation and will lead to more independence. It’s still early days, but the situation looks like a serious win for Huawei.
Mate 60 Pro - Huawei Makes It Possible
Around noon on August 29, 2023, before Raimondo’s meeting with Chinese Premier Li Qiang in Beijing, Huawei unveiled its new flagship smartphone Mate 60 Pro. With little fanfare, the newest model went on sale at the Huawei online store and some offline flagship stores. The first batch sold out within an hour. As tested by Bloomberg, Huawei’s new $960 (￥6,999) model clearly demonstrates wireless speeds akin to Apple’s latest iPhones and other 5G phones. What’s more, it also supports satellite phone calls.
Since May 2019, the U.S. Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security (“BIS”) has issued several rules to restrict Huawei from access to semiconductors produced by U.S. technology firms. As a result, Huawei was not able to produce 5G smart phones, and its market share went from world No. 1 in Q2 2020 to No. 6 in July 2023. It appears to many people that, with the Mate 60 Pro’s launch for China, Huawei is moving back into global contention.
Huawei’s Return with Kirin 9000s
The biggest attraction of the Mate 60 Pro is its in-house Kirin 9000s chipset, China’s first higher-end processor developed without American technology. It indicates that the semiconductor production capability of the China mainland has reached the level of Taiwan in 2019 or South Korea in 2020, and it's come at a speed beyond most industry watchers’ projections.
The manufacturing of high-end integrated circuits involves advanced technologies, equipment and materials in electronics, machinery, chemicals and optical material. Its production needs to take into account in both technology and costs, and requires extensive international cooperation in a specialty division of labor. Kirin 9000s chip made in China is a victory for Huawei over the U.S. sanctions that the Chinese telecommunication giant now can mass-produce chips with decent performance without U.S. technology. If it weren’t for the U.S. ban on Huawei, the idea for complete localization of chips would not even be thought of in China.
Who is Making Kirin 9000s?
According to an industry expert, it is very likely that Huawei has obtained its own wafer fabrication plant with 28nm process technology. Because China’s top chipmaker, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (SMIC) has been watched closely for compliance reasons, the expert believes that there is no SMIC involvement in Kirin 9000s’ production.
HiSilicon is Huawei’s chip designing subsidiary and is a fabless chip maker. Before the official implementation of U.S. sanctions, Huawei quickly bought out a lot of the underlying technologies from EDA software makers and ARM, allowing HiSilicon to improve its chip design that could achieves 10nm or better performance with 28nm technology.
What Else Beyond the Chip?
After the release of the Mate 60 Pro, almost all attention has been given to Kirin 9000s chip. In our view, the following two important aspects cannot be ignored as well:
1. Satellite communications
1. 1. Satellite communications
Excluding the impact of geopolitical factors, the most notable feature of Mate 60 Pro is its satellite-calling capability. While other leading brands like i-Phone can only offer emergency SOS and text messaging, Mate 60 Pro is the first smart phone allowing satellite calls in areas where there is no cellular connectivity, though such functionality is limited to China Telecom right now.
The implementation of the satellite call function shows Huawei is still a trendsetter. Huawei started from a manufacturer of communication equipment and its strength is in telecommunication. Satellite calls have opened a new direction for smart phones, and Huawei has set the new battlefield in the area it is best at. In reality, poor signal is what iPhone has been criticized for the most.
2. No plan for global launch
Huawei said it currently has no plans to launch Mate 60 Pro globally, sounds like a shame for such an impressive flagship phone. It is obvious Huawei will not give up the international market, and it is planning a new product launch on September 14, 2023, in Barcelona, Spain. One reason to exclude the global market for Mate 60 Pro could be chip supply, and another important one could be the lack of eco-system for its Harmony OS.
After being banned from using American technology and software in 2019, Huawei immediately released Harmony mobile phone operating system. Up to now, Huawei App Store has about 100,000 apps. However, compared with 3.57 million apps at Google Play Store or 2.18 million apps at the Apple’s, the gap is huge. The ecosystem is extremely important for a smart phone brand, now the ecosystem of the App Store creates more than $1.1 trillion in one year. Therefore, it is much more difficult for Huawei to bring excellent experience to its smart phone users outside China.
Because U.S. sanctions have significantly damaged Huawei, it may be a wise move to temporarily abandon some international markets, and it apparently has become part of Huawei’s strategy. Huawei’s founder Ren Zhengfei pointed out recently: “The company has made it clear that we want to strive to be a global leader in a limited range of businesses, not in every [market]. So, the boundaries of our products are contracting…”
The sudden release of Mate 60 Pro has ignited a fire in Chinese social media. Although the Kirin 9000s is probably still 2 generations behind the world’s most advanced chips, it marks a major breakthrough in the key field of semiconductors for China, a process that took only four years. The Chinese are now seeing the light in this tech-war between the two largest economies of today’s world.
To Huawei, the difficult period seems to have passed. Huawei’s 2023 half-year report shows its net profit has increased by 218% YOY, and in Q2 2023, its share of smart phones in the Chinese market surged from 7.3% a year ago to 13%. However, to quote an ancient Chinese proverb, the “last leg of a journey marks the halfway point (行百里者半九十).” Huawei is, however, far from breathing a sigh of relief.
To BIS, the Mate 60 Pro illustrates that the technology blockade has resulted in the withdrawal of American companies from the Chinese market. From a rational perspective, BIS might as well relax the restrictions below certain technology nodes and allow the U.S. firms to participate in the market. However, more likely BIS will use this as an excuse to impose tougher restrictions.
A Political Message?
On Jan 11, 2011, when the then U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates was flying to Beijing, China unveiled its new J-20 stealth fighter jet. Do we see a similar message being broadcast here – just as Raimondo arrives, Huawei, which had been hurt by U.S. sanctions, launches an innovative new product, and announces to the world, “We are Back!” We don’t know for certain whether the launch of Mate 60 Pro was planned to coincide with Raimondo’s visit, but the message shouldn’t be ignored. It wasnota coincidence. And the message is clear: ban companies from selling chips to China and suppliers of Huawei, ban companies from buying Huawei components, but China will continue to innovate, and it will be fine. At this point, the United States and its consumers – from Walmart to Apple customers – are more dependent on China than it is on them.
In April 2023, a company called AST SpaceMobile, in partnership with AT&T, made a satellite call using the Galaxy S22 Ultra, which doesn’t have any special capability. The call was made from Texas to another phone in Japan. But Samsung has not lunched satellite call function to its users as Huawei does for Mate 60 Pro users.Original text of Mr. Ren in Chinese: “公司已经明确, 我们要努力在有限的业务范围内领先世界, 不是在全方位领先。所以, 我们产品的边界是收缩的…”https://www.21jingji.com/article/20230904/herald/e8d0b87b879d73d93ffad47f7b855103.html
