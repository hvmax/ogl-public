AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy and, in particular, life in China. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. We have also written about thehistoryandcurrent stateof U.S.-China relations. Recently, we have written OGL Real Time pieces about the 20th Party Congress (here,here, andhere). In this post, we briefly comment on President Xi’s speech andprovide the text of this important addressin Chinese history.
At OGL, we were a little surprised by President Xi Jinping’s speech to the 20th Party Congress. We have pointed out in several places that, while Xi is the powerful leader of the world’s most populous nation and its second-largest economy, he is still subject to the Party. And the Party is very focused on economic growth. So, the fact that China is going to miss its growth projections for 2022 seemed like an important issue to us. Following an 8.1% GDP-growth rate in 2021, and a projected 5.5% for 2022, China is likely to come in with 3% to 3.5% for 2022. This is a serious issue, and we expected Xi might be contrite about the economic headwinds the country is facing.
Instead, the reality of the speech is that he carefully doubled down on a number of key issues, but he did so not in a Trumpian-finger-pointing-and-pounding-the-table fashion, He actually acknowledged the reality in a very intellectual and statesman-like fashion. Let’s look at a couple of examples:
Early on in the speech, Xi addressed the zero-COVID policy, and many are surely wondering about the impact this policy has had on the economy. He emphasized the notion that he and the Party thought of the people first:
“In responding to the sudden outbreak of COVID-19, we put the people and their lives above all else, worked to prevent both imported cases and domestic resurgences, and tenaciously pursued a dynamic zero-COVID policy. In launching an all-out people’s war to stop the spread of the virus, we have protected the people’s health and safety to the greatest extent possible and made tremendously encouraging achievements in both epidemic response and economic and social development.”
Of course, the veiled comparison here is that China has had about 5,200 deaths out of 1.4 billion citizens compared to the United States, which has tallied more than 1 million deaths of its 331 million population.
Then there was the issue of Taiwan. Xi focused not on confrontation but on reminding the world of the One-China Policy. “We have strengthened our strategic initiative for China’s complete reunification and consolidated commitment to the one-China principle within the international community."
Xi also talked about the development of the technology sector, monopolies, green tech, food safety, and many other items. It was an extensive speech both in breadth and depth. But, again, what was striking to our OGL team was the intellectual nuance that permeated the two-hour address.
Thisversion of the speechis the official English translation from Xinhua. For those who don’t wish to read through the entire speech, here is a list of the topics covered in various sections of this well-organized speech:
