AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide analyses about leadership in the global economy. In this post, Dr. Doug Guthrie, who is a co-founder of OGL, is continuing his series of China Journal entries. After returning to China in December of 2023, his first time back in the country since 2019, Guthrie curated a special series of China Journal entries reflecting on observations on returning to China after his COVID break. In May of 2024, he returned to China again to continue his research, continue helping his educational institution (Thunderbird School of Global Management at Arizona State University) to develop its presence in China, and continuing his efforts to assist the West in better understand China today. In this post, he discusses the case studies and the theory the OGL team is developing about Chinese capitalism.
The On Global Leadership project has been under way for four-and-a-half years. Since our founding in the Fall of 2019, we have been driven by the aspiration of helping the world more deeply understand China with all its complexities – the deep history and culture, the nature and structure of the economy, and the geopolitical structure. To this end, we have produced a significant amount of research showing that China’s economy is far and away the strongest economy in the world today. As the second largest economy in the world, it is in a strong position, and if current growth rates continue, and remain stable for the coming years – and we believe they will – China will be the world’s largest economy by 2035.
But this is not just an issue of sheer size. We firmly believe that the economic fundamentals of China’s market economy are superior to those of the United States. If those fundamentals are unchanged, China will be the world's dominant economy for decades to come. Indeed, as we have written previously, one of the great ironies of our time is that the world’s largest “communist” society is far and away the world’s most dynamic capitalist market economy in the 21st century.
Our work on the economy builds on the pathbreaking theoretical insight Andrew Walder (1995) articulated some thirty years ago. Walder argued that, while the transforming Soviet Bloc had descended into chaos with the “shock therapy” approach of rapid privatization and the unfettered unleashing of “free” markets advocated by Jeffrey Sachs and Janos Kornai, China remained stable, gradually transforming, gradually innovating, gradually rising to its current economic clout. China’s owes a good deal of its rise to its 2nd and 3rd tier cities, rather than China’s economic powerhouses like Shanghai and Shenzhen. The core of our research lies in those China’s smaller cities that most people outside of China have never heard of. We argue that these lesser known cities are the engines of China’s successful transformation.
On our research trips to China, our goal is to get out into the field and meet with the actors who have become the stars of this play. We have analyzed the data, and we have developed many in-depth case studies. But we needed more. We needed to talk to the individuals who are the key agents of this transformative moment. In my previous post, I cited Thomas Gold’s notion of guerilla interviewing as a way of getting a feel for how the capitalist actors are thinking about their plans and their paths forward. As we recount our case studies here, we are relying on semi-structured, in-depth interviews, which allow us to gather both facts about the reform process and also the qualitative, ethnographic experiences of the interviewees. If you are going to make claims about economic reasoning, motivations, the logic of action, deeply held beliefs, then you have to sit down with individuals and listen.
After landing in China in mid-May, we flew to Zhengzhou for an intensive two-day immersion in this Chinese city. Zhengzhou is a very important Chinese city and an interesting case for us. While most of our research today focuses on China’s 2nd and 3rd tier cities, we have also done in-depth case research on cities that have made the transition from lower tier to powerhouse 1st tier city status. Zhengzhou is one such city, and it represents a strong case to highlight successful economic development in China’s reform era. We have written extensively about Zhengzhou’s dramatic rise (here), exploring issues such as the city’s centrality in China’s railroad network, the importance of the floating population, the critical nature of relationships with global manufacturing juggernauts Foxconn and Apple.
Two Days in Zhengzhou

My OGL research collaborator Chris Gao and I were here to do some guerilla interviewing with the officials at this center of this city's dramatic rise. We spent the morning of our first day with leaders in Zhengzhou’s open economic zone, the Zhengzhou Economic and Technological Development Zone [jingji keji kaifaqu]. Open economic zones are key parts of developing cities in China, as they are often established to attract foreign and domestic capital, offering special incentives and tax and regulatory treatment to the companies that invest there. They are essential to building China’s powerful industrial clusters.
I always find it is useful to see these areas up close, walk the grounds, tour some companies that are operating in these zones and helping to turn them into fast moving economic drivers. We spent time in the factories of three different companies, and talked with two key Zhengzhou officials. Listening to their accounts of how, why, and when these zones were established, as well as hearing their visions for the future of the zone are crucial to the research process.
In the afternoon, Chris and I used the time to take in the historical richness of this place. I had an almost visceral reaction to this: we were in Zhengzhou, Henan Province, home of one of China’s most famous museums of ancient history. Henan is viewed as one of China's birthplaces. Deep history here. The ancient Xia, Shang, Zhou Dynasties were all here.
Thoughts of this place take me back to my undergraduate life at the University of Chicago, where my early introduction to China was Professor Ed Shaughnessy’s Ancient Chinese Civilization course. I jumped at the chance to go with Chris to Henan Museum. I had been there before, but tired as I was, there was no way I was going to sit in a hotel room when I could be looking at ancient oracle bone inscriptions.
After our museum visit, we walked the city a bit. As economically developed and openly welcoming of foreign investment as cities like Zhengzhou are, there is just a different feeling to places like this compared to cities like Shanghai, which feels like China but also has the experience of an international city with its foreigners and foreign languages. Places like Zhengzhou are very welcoming, and very Chinese.
One funny moment illustrating this difference: late in the afternoon, Chris and I were sitting outside drinking tea and watching the city walk by. I was in front of a large mural on the wall behind me, processing what we learned from the morning’s interviews and site visits. At one point, it became clear that more and more people were taking pictures in our direction. At first, I thought they were taking pictures of the mural behind me. But it became clear after several minutes that people were taking pictures of the foreigner sitting in front of the mural (me!). I would not have the same experience in Shanghai.

Five days after returning to Shanghai, we headed off to Zhenjiang. In an earlier post, we recounted the story of our last research visit to Zhenjiang. Zhenjiang is a “small,” 3rd tier Chinese city in Jiangsu Province. It is also the Sister City of Tempe, Arizona, home of my current academic institutions Arizona State University and the Thunderbird School of Global Management. In that earlier post, we wrote about the ease with which the leader of Zhenjiang’s Bureau of Commerce, Director Yu, used the language of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and innovation to describe the responsibilities of his Bureau.
Our return to Zhenjiang brought us back for another visit with Director Yu and his team. Here again, we found the mindset and culture of innovation, KPIs, and visionary plans for next steps in the economic development process. Listening to Director Yu and his team, I was once again struck by how committed to economic growth these leaders of economic growth in China are. They truly sound like leaders of business units in a large industrial firm, echoing the imagery of Andrew Walder’s Local Governments as Industrial Firms theory. I couldn’t imagine a leader of a local Department of Commerce in some American city speaking like this.
It's no wonder westerners cannot understand this economic vitality, as their repeating historical definitions of "communism" and the assumptions and misperceptions that word carries. I guess it’s not surprising why so many Americans are skeptical about China’s economic transformation. Here we have a Chinese Communist Party official in a “small” city in inland China, and he speaks as eloquently about innovation, economic development and growth, and a vision for the next steps for his open economic zones as any business leader I have encountered in the world.
It is also interesting to note the differences in the two cities. Zhengzhou is now a Tier 1, high-profile economy, the target of collaborative projects with economic powerhouses like Foxconn and Apple. At one point, as he was planning our visit to Zhengzhou, Chris needed a picture of my passport – foreigners can’t just waltz into Zhengzhou and sit down with government officials without a least a little bit of a background check and the right paperwork on file.
Zhenjiang feels much different. For one thing, one of Chris’ friends, an old colleague from his days at Home Depot, is from Zhenjiang. In Chinese culture, place of origin is an important identifier. It is not uncommon when people are introducing themselves to each other to hear someone say, “Oh, I’m also a XX person!” [wo ye shi xx ren!]. So, receiving help in setting up our interviews in Zhenjiang from a native son was a big help. His friend also accompanied us on the Zhenjiang trip. In any case, these types of experiences – observing the mindset and culture of innovation and economic development, getting a sense of how the leaders think about their responsibilities, and feeling how they treat researchers and guests are all crucial parts of the on-the-ground research experience. They are observations a researcher simply cannot see in the data.
After Chris and I returned from Zhengzhou and Zhenjiang, we had a call with the rest of the OGL team. The elephant in the room: What's our theory explaining this economic success? This is how iterative, multi-method, team-based research works: you develop a theory; you come up with some testable hypotheses; you gather data; you analyze the data; you go out into the field and ask questions; you gather more data; you refine your theory; then you come up with a logical theory. This is ours.
1. Local Governments as Industrial Firms (Walder 1995): Entrepreneurial Management
As we have written previously, “local governments at provincial, city, district and county levels are the engines driving China’s powerful system of economic growth. Indeed, the Chinese government is an extremely decentralized and entrepreneurial system of district and township governments.” (here) “District heads are probably most like VPs of business units – they must deliver against the strategic plans of the holding company (the Central Government) and the corporation (the provincial or municipal government), but they also have a significant amount of autonomy to run their business units (their district governments) as they see fit. (NOTE: “Autonomy” is a sensitive word in this context. In this conversation, we are thinking of the concept ofzizhuquan[自主权] as opposed tozizhiquan[自治权]. Both are translated in Chinese-English dictionaries as “autonomy” but there is a subtle difference. The former has a feeling of usingauthorized(delegated) power; the latter has more of a self-governing meaning, which is not what we are talking about here.)”
This part of the theory was strongly confirmed in our on-site case interviews. Talking with the Directors of the Bureaus of Commerce in Zhengzhou and Zhenjiang, we were again fascinated by the language of strategic planning for economic development of their cities, KPIs, economic forecasting, and so much more. These directors spoke like managers of business units. But their roles are more than just managing a plan and hitting target numbers. What really came through in our interviews wasEntrepreneurial Management. Local governments as industrial firms, for sure, but what was so striking about these interviews was the ways in which these managers think creatively about the development of new economic ventures. Entrepreneurial Management of Local Governments is crucial to China’s political culture of innovative local economic development.
It is also critical to observe just how important innovation is to the people we were interviewing. They speak thoughtfully and passionately about innovation, often bringing the conversation back to their innovative efforts and their vision for the future. There is a deep body of research on innovation in economic development. Indeed, my old friend and colleague Dan Breznitz, has written one of the great recent books on innovation in economic development,Innovation in Real Places: Strategies for Prosperity in an Unforgiving World(Oxford 2021). We defer to the deep expertise of Professor Breznitz and other scholars of innovation. However, we follow one of Breznitz’s key points here: scholars of innovation, often conflate the concepts of innovation and invention, resulting in what Breznitz calls a “techno-fetishism” about innovation, thus failing to see when important new ideas drive economic development and transformation. It is a stepwise, incremental process, when local leaders and government officials, gradually but constantly push for improvement and change. In this broader framing of economic development, the leaders we are interviewing are as innovative as any business leaders you might imagine.
3. Systems Thinking
A third element that is emerging in our research is Systems Thinking. It is striking just how much leaders like Director Yu think and talk openly about their cities' position in an ecosystem. This is a big difference between the Chinese model and the free-market mindset of the American model. In the system of deregulated free market capitalism, competition reigns supreme. Indeed, cut-throat competition is central to the logic of free market capitalism. And if other players are hurt in the process and, perhaps, in the case of businesses, driven out of business, that is just the nature of free markets and capitalism. Markets have winners and losers. But Chinese leaders simply don’t speak this way. As much as they talk about economic development, innovation, and KPIs, they also talk often about the system as a whole and how their local economy fits into this system. There may be winners and losers, but whatever happens is considered and supports the system as a whole.
In my next journal entry post, I will write about field research and teaching. And in my final post, I will talk about the critical moment we face in U.S.-China relations and how much I hope this kind of on-the-ground research can help.
