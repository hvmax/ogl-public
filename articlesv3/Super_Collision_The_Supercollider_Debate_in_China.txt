### Super Collision: The Supercollider Debate in China

13 January 2023|China, Innovation, Science
AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy and, in particular, life in China. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. We have written about economic development in China and China’s economic reforms, US-China relations, China’s changing role in the global political economy, and the history and current state of Chinese politics. We have also written about China's industry sectors and technology investments. In this post, we explore the debate about whether China should invest in a supercollider to advance basic science research.
"Does China need to build a supercollider?"
A debate on a pure science topic has taken center stage on social media, and it is a phenomenon never seen before in China. This article will introduce the debate on China's supercollider and use it to illustrate the decision-making for China's Major National S&T Infrastructure (1).
For more than a century, large and complex scientific machines have been an indispensable part of basic-science research. The supercollider becomes the latest entry in that long line of innovation. By building colliders, particle physicists expand humankind's understanding of matter, energy, space, and time.
In 2012, the Chinese particle physics community, led by Wang Yifang (2), director of the Institute of High Energy Physics (IHEP) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), proposed a two-stage circular collider projects in China, which are known as Circular Electron Positron Collider (CEPC) and Super Proton–Proton Collider (SppC).
If the development plays out according to script, the CEPC, phase I, will focus on the Higgs boson or "God" particle. In phase II, SppC would be a collider capable of accelerating electrons and positrons at energies approaching a trillion electron volts (TeV), an unprecedented center-of-mass energy creator. It would have seven times the collision energy of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) run by CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research (3), which is by far the largest scientific instrument on earth.
The construction budget of CEPC, excluding land, is estimated at RMB 36 billion (US$5.6 billion), and the total budget would exceed US$20 billion when SppC is completed.
The debate over China’s supercollider project continued after its inception, especially in 2016, after the participation of heavyweight scientists such as Yang Chen-Ning, Wang Yifang, and Yau Shing-Tung (2), was announced. The academic debate on CEPC-SppC evolved into a public topic on social media, raising the stakes. In a crucial vote, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) cast a decisive veto, excluding CEPC from the China's 13th Five-Year Plan (2016-2020).
"From the Great Wall to the Great Collider”
Grown out of nuclear physics, particle physics or high-energy physics (HEP) explores the fundamental questions of the nature of mass, energy, and matter, and their relations to the history of the universe. On July 4, 2012, scientists at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland announced the detection of the Higgs boson particle through experiments at LHC. The Higgs particle is an invisible elementary particle first proposed in the 1960s that began to explain the mystery of mass. The discovery ranks No. 1 among the top 10 scientific advances of 2012 byScienceMagazine. The Higgs boson discovery marks not only the completion of the final piece of Standard Model (4) puzzle, but also a turning point of particle physics because there hasn’t been another earth-shattering discovery since.
China's high-energy physics community believes that the detection of the Higgs particle has given China a historical opportunity to leap forward in fundamental physics research. CEPC-SppC is their action plan to grab this opportunity.
The CEPC, a Higgs factory, will measure the physical properties of Higgs particles. SppC will be the magic device to make the ultimate breakthrough. CEPC-SppC will be hosted by IHEP and operate in a CERN-like manner, bringing in the best physicists from around the world and becoming an international physics research center.
Scientists also pointed out that China will face fierce competition from Europe and Japan, and the window left for China is less than a decade. If China fails to kick off the CEPC project by 2025, the window of opportunity will be closed.
Fields Medal winner and mathematician Yau Shing-Tung is one of the most active advocates of CEPC-SPPC. Yau and Steve Naris co-authored,From the Great Wall to the Great Collider: China and the Quest to Uncover the Inner Workings of the Universe( 5), a book to promote the significance of CEPC-SPPC to the public. In the book, Yau names Qinhuangdao, a port city 300 kilometers east of Beijing where the Great Wall meets the Pacific Ocean, a favorite location for the Great Collider. In another article, Yau says "the success of quantum mechanics has raised our understanding of nature to a higher level" (6) in describing the importance of the supercollider.
The Conceptual Design Report (CDR) of CEPC was completed in 2018. The work on Technical Design Report (TDR) began in 2019 and is scheduled to finish by the end of 2022. If the proposal is approved, construction will begin during the 14th Five-Year Plan period (2021-2025) and obtain experimental data around 2030.
Particle physicists around the world are excited about the possibility of a new supercollider in China. Several high profile scientists have expressed their support for CEPC-SppC. David J. Gross, 2004 Nobel laureate in physics, called it a “ Great Collider”, and it " provides China a magnificent opportunity to take a lead role … in physics” (7)
“The Party Is Over”
Readers may ask why the opportunity to participate in the varsity league of particle physics has turned to China? The answer is simple, MONEY.
The making of a supercollider is a financial black hole. After the Higgs particle was found, the next step for particle physics is to build a Higgs factory to understand more about the particle and to consider how to monetize the physics. Three projects are currently being planned – the International Linear Collider or ILC (Japan), CEPC-SppC (China) and the Future Circular Collider or FCC( Europe). They have two things in common – all three cost lots of money and all have challenges raising funds for their construction. The 2008 economic downturn spurred by the financial crisis and the United States' lack of a plan at all leaves China as a major potential source of funding for the future of high-energy physics.
For most people, this question still deserves an answer: If a supercollider has so much scientific value, why aren't the Americans doing it?
Marked by the success of accelerators/colliders, high-energy physics ushered in a Golden Age in the 1960-70s. Despite the resulting glory, more and more people started to question the scientific value and cost of ever-larger accelerators. The $9 billion LHC is certainly an engineering wonder that has and will give several thousand particle physicists something to do for some 30 years, and, certainly, it detected the "God" particle (the Higgs particle). But has LHC resulted in any discoveries in the area of new physics? Zero. Without a new theory, no one know how large a supercollider needs to be in order to find new particles. There are fears that a new collider, financed with large amounts of public money, will end up benefiting a few high-energy physicists without any substantial findings.
In China, Nobel laureate in physics Yang Chen-Ning is the most outstanding public opponent of CEPC-SppC. In September 2016, Yang wrote a widely shared blog titled, "China should not build a supercollider today." Due to Yang's authority in physics, his objection was widely disseminated in China and brought the debate to a climax. Topping Yang's list of objections against CEPC-SppC is his feeling China should not repeat the disaster on Super Semiconductor Collider (SSC) made by Americans.
When the U.S. Congress terminated the SSC in October 1993, about $2 billion had been spent, with another $1 billion to spend to close it. It was largest basic-science project ever attempted, and ended up creating the most expensive federal budget blackhole in U.S. history.
Three years later, in 2019, when 97-year-old Yang was giving a lecture to 2,000 graduate students at the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, a student asked him if he still opposed a supercollider in China. Yang replied, "my opinion has not changed at all." He then reiterated his comment made in 1980 about the future of high-energy physics: "The party is over." (8)
One Vote Short – CEPC Is not Supported by the NDRC
The debate over a potential supercollider has popularized high-energy physics with the public, allowing different voices to be heard by policymakers in Beijing. So far, neither the pro nor the opposing side have been able to convince each other. Of course, Wang Yifang, the head of IHEP the project's initiator, is carrying more weight on his shoulder. He must promote the CEPC-SppC to the public, explaining the importance of the project in words that everyone from politicians to ordinary people can understand. The more challenging work for Wang is seeking funding for the project, particularly having the CEPC being included in the Major National S&T Infrastructure list of China.
The Major National S&T Infrastructure (MNSTI) is described as a "national public facility with great international influence that provides services for high-level research activities for a long period"(9). MNSTI projects are listed in China's five-year plan. NDRC is the principal administrative authority of MNSTI, and other relevant authorities are the Ministry of Finance (MIF), the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST), and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC). NDRC approval is a must-have for projects to be qualified as MNSTI.
The MNSTI projects must go through four principal steps: project proposal, feasibility report, preliminary design and budget report, and commencement report. Among them, the most important threshold is the approval of the project proposal. Considerations taken into account are societal value, scientific significance, urgency, budget plan, applicable technology, etc.
In 2016, Wang Yifang told the story how the project was voted down in an interview. In a debriefing and discussion session for pre-research funding organized by NDRC, CEPC failed to move forward to the next phase because it fell one vote short. Therefore, the project was excluded from the 13th Five-Year Plan (10).
Here are some details in social media about that meeting:
The pre-research funding applied for by CEPC was￥800 million ($116 million);The voting panel was comprised of five scientists in high-energy physics and five scientists in the non-high-energy physics field, plus one representative from NDRC.Since CEPC was not able to convince any voters from the non-high-energy physics panel, it was not surprising that the NDRC took a cautious approach and cast a no vote.

Beijing has not completely turned off its support for the CEPC-SppC like the U.S. government did with the SSC. While the project failed again to enter the 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-2025), it had received ￥300 - 400 million funding in total by 2020 from CAS, MOST, and NSFC to support research on key technologies and components for a supercollider.
The Future of CEPC-SppC
There are so many R&D projects in the world that need funding, whether the U.S., Europe, Japan or China. Like their counterparts, lobbying for public support for big projects has become routine work for Chinese scientists as well. For China's R&D funding overseers, who are well informed and understand how to calculate input-output ratios, national prestige or the curiosity of scientists are not enough.
Another consideration for Beijing is that “the golden eggs are very seldom produced by the golden geese”. Rather than betting on a controversial “big science” endeavor, why not support more “small science” projects? The April 7, 2022, edition of"Science”features a symbolic finding by Fermilab on the mass of the W boson, which suggests that improvements to the standard model might be needed. The planned CEPC-SppC tunnel is 100 kilometers long and counts decades in its construction and service life cycles. While the Chinese are good at digging tunnels, NDRC is more concerned that in the middle of construction, some new theory will emerge that could overturn the scientific foundation of its research.
In the context of the current rocky U.S.- China relationship, China’s science and technology policies are now focusing on self-reliance and self-improvement because generations of Chinese leaders have learned that “China can not ask for, buy, or beg for core technologies in key fields from other countries” (11).
The current strategy of financial support is going to research related to the U.S. Bureau of Industry and Security Entity List, i.e., artificial intelligence, quantum information, integrated circuits and biotechnology, etc. The supercollider may have extraordinary significance to high-energy physicists in China and maybe its foreign peers, but it does have much influence  around strategic national goals important to economic growth or national security.
Overall speaking, CEPC-SppC is a project China can afford to wait on. Decision makers in Beijing have adopted a rational and pragmatic approach through a middle course, neither launch the project nor completely abandon it. Thanks to the Americans, Beijing has learned every valuable lesson of a supercollider, from its inception to potential demise.
