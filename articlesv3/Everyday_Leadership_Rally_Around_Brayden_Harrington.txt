AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. Several of us have advised companies and taught about leadership over theyears, and we have developed atheoryof leadership that takes us away from the charismatic leader to the person on the ground fighting for the team, community, or family. In this post, we seek to continue our advancement of a view of everyday leadership. – The Editorial Team
Small acts of courage can be transformed into moments of great bravery, especially when broadcast to tens of millions of Americans. Thirteen-year-old Brayden Harrington brought this home to me last week when he spoke at the Democratic National Convention and reminded me of the profound power of embracing your vulnerability.
Brayden, who lives in New Hampshire, was invited to speak at the convention after he met Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden at a rally earlier this year. Brayden’s two-minute speech was courageous and powerful, shaping the world and inspiring people in ways he probably never imagined he would. Across the nation, people were moved to goosebumps and tears—here was a deeply inspirational person, and he was still only a child.
“Without Joe Biden, I wouldn’t be talking to you today,” Brayden told listeners. During his first meeting with Biden in February, the former vice president told him they were “members of the same club. We stutter.” You see, Biden is a stutterer too.
“It was really amazing to hear that someone like me became vice-president. He told me about a book of poems by Yeats he would read out loud to practice,” Brayden said. “He showed me how he marks his addresses to make them easier to say out loud. So, I did the same thing today. And now I’m here talking to you today about the future, about our future.”
Brayden’s speech exhibited bravery and courage, elements of Everyday Leadership that we discuss so often here. We believe leaders are forged in the day-to-day work of life and organizations. The anchors of our framework are organized around five key pillars: complexity and alignment, humility and courage, democracy, introspection and creativity.
As a society, we often frame leadership as the bold, visionary decisions made by someone in a position at the top of an organizational hierarchy. Personally, I like the word courage better. Those concepts and behaviors are there for the taking for everyone, every single day. Brayden showed a level of emotional maturity in his convention speech. He did not let fear dissuade him, and he inspired millions of people with his strengthandvulnerability.
Vulnerability on this scale is more than scary. It can be petrifying. Sharing a piece of yourself can be a risk, but it also opens up an opportunity for connection. Most viewers probably knew that Brayden was feeling exposed, who wouldn’t at that moment, but the sharing of that feeling allowed him to connect with the audience and exhibit his leadership as young person calling for change and encouraging other young people to go to the polls and vote.
Brayden was an unlikely presenter at the convention. Few people with speech impediments are encouraged to speak at national conventions, and fewer of them are young teenagers. As reported by Leana Wen inThe Washington Post, “Ben Goldstein, a Bethesda-based speech-language pathologist and PWS [people who stutter] himself, described it as a ‘pinch me’ moment. ‘Growing up, I can’t remember a single instance of stuttering being presented in a positive light in popular culture or on a national scale. If it was mentioned at all, it was something that was ridiculed and mocked. To see a kid share the bravery, courage and vulnerability that stuttering often forces us into, and show it so well – it’s hard to put into words what that felt like and means for so many of us.’”
Brayden’s leadership extended far beyond the PWS community. His vulnerability made him real, his call to action poignant and his ability to touch us irresistible. Vulnerability is a leadership concept that I love, and it is not one we teach very well in executive education classes. I cannot recount how many times I have taught leadership in executive settings in which participants are adamant that leaders should not show vulnerability.
As the evening and the convention concluded last Thursday night, with a very powerful speech by Biden as well, I was certain that the most memorable moments of the night would be those associated with Brayden. Certainly, brave children move us as a society and always have. But Brayden offered something more, and I am thankful for his everyday leadership at this time in U.S. history where we need more not fewer voices of young people in our political process.
