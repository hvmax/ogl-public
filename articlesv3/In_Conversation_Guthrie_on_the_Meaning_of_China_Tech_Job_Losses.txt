### In Conversation: Guthrie on the Meaning of China Tech Job Losses

In Conversation with CNN Business, OGL's Doug Guthrie responds to concerns that China’s year-long campaign to trim the power of its Big Tech sector has triggered extensive furloughs and layoffs in the tech employment market.
1. What do job losses at this scale mean for the tech sector? Is it just the beginning? What does that mean for the economy?
There are two sides to this question. First, the job losses are definitely significant. Tens of thousands of jobs lost in a sector that has been one of the most powerful and innovative in China’s growing economy since the early 2000s would be significant under any circumstances. There will be pain in the economy, though this category of employees can probably withstand furloughs and layoffs longer than employees in the manufacturing sector would be able to sustain.
The second part of the answer is that the job losses in this sector are somewhat self-inflicted. Starting with the sidelining of the Ant Financial IPO in November 2020, President Xi Jinping's aggressive stance on China’s big-tech and fintech sectors have been conducted in the name of the Common Prosperity Movement – an initiative to rein in China’s largest private companies and remind them that, while they may be global companies, they must also serve China in helping to raise the prosperity of Chinese society.
Inasmuch as the wounds are self-inflicted, they can be reversed, and I am certain they will be. There is already evidence that the Chinese Communist Party is working to “recalibrate” Xi’s position on the Common Prosperity movement and the regulation of Big Tech.
Finally, it is crucial for the Party’s legitimacy (as well as Xi’s continuing reign) that the economy continues to grow. If President Xi’s policies translate into massive layoffs and ultimately affect economic growth, there will be a serious recalibration by the Party leadership.
2. Is it the worst unemployment crisis in China in some time? China underwent massive waves of job losses before, such as when tens of millions of state-sector jobs were cut in late 1990s. How is this time different?
This is not the worst unemployment crisis in recent history (i.e., the era of economic reforms). As you note, there were many millions of jobs lost with the aggressive state-owned enterprise SOE reform enacted in the late 1990s under Zhu Rongji. However, the late-1990s reform of the state sector was a necessary step forward in helping the economy transition from a very inefficient economy that was dominated by the State sector to one that was more balanced – more efficient in the State sector and balanced by a healthy private economy. But here again, this moment of unemployment is somewhat self-inflicted – there are, of course, the slowdowns that have occurred because of the pandemic and perhaps will deepen because of the Russia-Ukraine war – as the layoffs in the tech sector are largely the result of Central Government policies. And these policies can be reversed (and they likely will).
3. What would be the consequences if so many people lose jobs? Is it the biggest challenge for Chinese President Xi Jinping as he seeks a third term as leader later this year? The leader has emphasized that maintaining stability would be the government’s top priority this year, especially the economic stability.
The upheaval in the tech sector will indeed be a significant challenge for  Xi  as he seeks a third terms as leader in October of this year. Stability and economic growth have been the most important hallmarks of this regime. By guaranteeing stability, Xi has been given latitude to push a number of aggressive agendas – major legal and regulatory changes, a new more aggressive stance toward multi-national corporations (MNCs), the Common Prosperity Movement, and aggressive regulation of Chinese technology and financial technology sectors. But if economic growth stalls and unemployment rises significantly, the backlash will be quick, and it will affect his appointment to a third term.
4. Last week, Chinese Vice Premier Liu He (a top economic advisor to Xi) reassured investors that Beijing would substantially boost the economy and stabilize financial markets, in an effort to stem a market rout. Do you think that means Beijing’s regulatory crackdown and unpredictable policymaking will come to an end? Is the pain over?
In short, yes. Liu He is widely trusted as a sage and moderate voice in the Party. Leaders like Liu and other influential thought leaders like Justin Lin have been vocal recently about the importance of China maintaining stability and growth. Two things are clear: First, these leaders are trying to reassure the Chinese citizenry and, more broadly, that China continues to be committed to stability and growth. Second, a message is being sent to President Xi that the aggressive reforms can only go so far. So yes, I believe the message is emerging that the pain is over and unpredictable policymaking will come to an end.
