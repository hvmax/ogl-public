### SHENYANG MACHINE TOOLS: WHEN STATE-OWNED ENTERPRISE REFORM FAILS

13 July 2024|China, China politics, City Profile
AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy and, in particular, life in China. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. We have sought to advance a conversation about the U.S.-China relationship, and a deep understanding of local economic development in China. We have written a series about the strategic strength oflocal economic development in China’s 2nd and 3rd tier citiesandentrepreneurship in China today. These case studies are part of a larger project in which we report on the strength of China’s economic development model (e.g.,hereandhere). This transformation has been a mixed and, at times, difficult. This post follows an earlier post in which we began to explore the development of Liaoning Province’s Shenyang, a key site of China’s automobile industry. The case serves as a “negative case analysis,” a case that provides some contrast to the powerful positive examples examined in other cases (e.g.hereandhere).This article introduces the venture of SYMT over the past 30 years, providing insight into the complexity of SOE reform in China.
One of OGL’s main areas of focus lies in explaining the overwhelming success of China’s transition from a failed planned economy to the world’s second largest economy -- and soon to be the largest economy. In a number of articles, we have pointed to the irony that Communist China is the world’s most dynamic and innovative capitalist economy so far in the 21st century.
We have adopted Professor Andrew Walder’s analysis, where he describes the innovative, entrepreneurial behavior of local governments through the metaphor of “local governments as industrial firms.” Walder’s insight, first articulated in his 1995 article in theAmerican Journal of Sociology, was put forward to explain a puzzle: with the fall of the Berlin Wall and the general acceptance that the Soviet-style planned economies had failed, the transforming Soviet Bloc adopted the so-called “shock therapy” of the rapid privatization approach advocated by Jeffrey Sachs and Janos Kornai. China rejected this approach, opting instead to gradually transform its state-owned economy. Very quickly it became clear that the rapid privatization model was a disaster, plunging those economies into chaos, while China’s gradual transformation was proving successful.
A close alliance between states and the markets they govern is the healthiest path to sustained economic development. This is a position we have long held. As our colleague Doug Guthrie has previously argued, “The lack of a sudden shift in political structure and economic policy – and the lack of a symbolic moment in which the Chinese government has suddenly broken from the past and embraced western systems and values (like the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 or Yeltsin’s tank speech in 1991) – has often led observers to underestimate the significance of the social and political reforms that have occurred in China. The reality is that changes in China have been radical and deep… [Economic reforms] have been successful in China preciselybecauseof state involvement. Contrary to the economic assumptions that have guided many reform prescriptions – that rapid privatization is a necessary ingredient of successful reform – gradualism and state involvement not only works, but it is a superior policy. China has built the world’s most dynamic economy through direct state involvement. This argument also extends to current political wrangling in the United States: state involvement in markets is a positive thing, and China is surging ahead in several key sectors precisely because of a healthy balance between state and market” (Guthrie 2012, p. 7).
In previous work, we have looked at many of the institutional reforms that have driven State-Owned Enterprise (SOE) reform, and we have also gone deep on many of the cases that help illustrate how and why these reforms have been so successful. (See, for example, Doug Guthrie,Dragon in a Three-Piece Suit: The Emergence of Capitalism in China; Guthrie, et al., “Stability, Asset Management, and Gradual Change in China’s Reform Economy,” inChina’s State Capitalism: State Capitalism, Institutional Adaptation, and the Chinese Miracle, edited by Barry Naughton and Kellee Tsai.) SOE reform in China has largely been a gradual, step-wise and experimental process.
The SOE reform project has been largely successful. However, experimental transformation is not perfect. We believe that by looking at the negative cases of SOE reform, we will gain as much insight in building a solid argument as the positive cases do. Negative cases can help us observe the variables associated with – either positively or negatively – various outcomes, and can drive a greater understanding of China’s role in today’s global economy.
The Case of SMYT, Shenyang
After China ushered in its journey of reform, the development of its Northeast lagged behind other regions. One important reason for that was reforms of SOEs in the Northeast did not achieve the desired results. Shenyang Machine Tool (SYMT) is symbolic of SOEs in Shenyang and the Northeast. The powerhouse of China’s machine tool industry and the powerhouse of the region, SYMT could not escape bankruptcy, despite 30 years of economic reforms. In 2019, it became a second-tier subsidiary of General Technology Group (GENERTEC), a centrally administered SOE.
Shenyang Machine Tool, or 沈阳机床, refers to different entities at the various times in its lifecycle. Understanding the nuance will help readers comprehend the system of China’s SOEs. “SMTCL” refers to Shenyang Machine Tool Co. Ltd., “SYMG” refers to Shenyang Machine Tool (Group) Co., Ltd. “SYMC”, is a common name for SYMG or SMTCL and their subsidiaries combined.
Shenyang used to be the capital in China’s machine tools industry. Among the Soviet–aided “156 Industrial Projects” from the 1950s, three out of 18 machine tool projects were in Shenyang, and they were revered across China. In 1993, as one of the loan terms of the World Bank, the Shenyang Municipal Government established SMTCL with relatively high-quality assets from the city’s machine tool industry. In 1995, SYMG was formed with non-SMTCL assets mainly from the same group of companies. At that time, both companies were affiliated to Shenyang State-Owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC). At the end of 2019, SYMG and SMTCL were transformed from Shenyang regionally-controlled SOE to non-affiliated second-tier subsidiaries of GENERTEC after a judicial reorganization because of insolvency(1).
SYMG and SMTCL have been affiliated companies through a number of factors:
The companies have strong linkage in asset, business and financeThe chairman of SYMG and SMTCL has always been the same personAnd from November 2008 to August 2019, SYMG was the majority shareholder and de facto controller of SMTCL
• The companies have strong linkage in asset, business and finance
• The chairman of SYMG and SMTCL has always been the same person
• And from November 2008 to August 2019, SYMG was the majority shareholder and de facto controller of SMTCL
Reform and Transformation
Standing up SMTCL from its parent SYMT is similar to creating a new subsidiary from a successful business unit, i.e., a large SOE group spins off its high-quality assets to form a joint-stock company, and the group becomes the new company’s largest shareholder. Since most of the historical burdens are left with the holding company, it is easier for the new company to implement market-oriented reforms and attract new investments.
Since the establishment of SMTCL in 1993, the pace of reform at SYMT has not stopped. In 1994, SMTCL became a pilot enterprise of the modern enterprise system among 100 large and medium-sized enterprises identified by the State Council. In 1995, SYMG explored a new organizational structure between parent company and subsidiary. In the decade that followed, SYMT implemented a series of reform measures, including the establishment of manufacturing divisions (1997), setting up two joint ventures (1999), separating supporting functions from the main business (2002), the reform of its sales model (2005), enterprise process reengineering (2006-2007) and so on. In 2017, after eight ministries and commissions of the State Council issued a plan to overhaul the company, SYMG was on the list of pilot comprehensive reform of SOEs in Northeast China. In 2019, with the support of the central government, GENERTEC implemented judicial reorganization of SYMT.
Government Support
While there is general agreement that SOEs must be reformed – and there has been agreement on this since the early 1990s – the question is how? In the 1990s, it was clear that many SOEs had difficulty in operation, with issues like obsolete equipment, products that didn’t meet market demands, and the extreme shortage of working capital. In considering reforms, the first conundrum was: where would the funds for reform come from? SYMT, while also facing many difficulties, was in a much better financial position than most other SOEs in Shenyang. For decades, Shenyang City, Liaoning Province and even the central government had been doing whatever possible to support SYMT.
Additional activities that supported SYMT included:
World Bank loan – SYMT is the only enterprise in the machine tool industry in China that has received a loan from the World Bank. From 1995 to 2003, on the basis of US$121 million (1,052.7 million yuan) loan from the World Bank, SYMT carried out large-scale equipment renewal and plant renovation, with a total investment of 2.275 billion yuan. These projects had significantly improved its competitiveness.Public listing – In 1996, through joint efforts of the Ministry of Machinery Industry, Liaoning Province and Shenyang City, SMTCL, a three-year-old company, raised 225 million yuan through an IPO. It was a time when there were only four publicly listed companies in Shenyang, and most machine tool companies had difficulty paying their bills.Subsidies and debt restructuring – SMTCL’s financial reports reveal that it has received various government subsidies, industry support funds, tax rebates, etc. Under the permission of the government, SMTCL negotiated debt restructuring with suppliers almost every year. It forced its suppliers to reduce account receivables.

Debt/Equity Swap – SYMT obtained a large number of bank loans to support its development and operation. After 2014, when its performance declined steadily and SYMT was unable to repay bank loans, the government converted huge amounts of bank loans into the equity of SYMT. In 2017, the total amount of debt/equity swap was 9.251 billion yuan for SYMG, and in 2019, 12 billion yuan for SMTCL.

If it weren’t for SYMT’s special status with the government, it would have been impossible to get so much favor and support from the government.
In 1994, Beijing launched reforms to build a modern enterprise system within China’s SOEs and fully rolled out the approach in September 1999. By 2012, the government concluded that reform goals had been achieved basically. One major task of the reform was to establish a modern human resource management system that consisted of an employment system, a personnel system and an income distribution system. Because the practice of linking income level with profits of an enterprise had been widely accepted at that time, the focus of human resources reform was established. The factors included:
A labor system that reduces redundancy and increases efficiency (减员增效). When the business conditions of an enterprise are not good, SOEs can also carry out layoffs.A personnel system establishing that a manager can be promoted or demoted (能上能下). The management personnel of a SOE are no longer state cadres, and the position must be fulfilled through an open, merit-based hiring process. A fixed-term appointment system should be implemented with regular performance evaluations.

Based on media reports, 130,000 of 300,000 workers in Tiexi District, where SYMT was located, lost their jobs during the SOE reform period, from the 1990s to the early 2000s. Although SYMT was in a much better position than other companies in the region, its downsizing matched other companies. From 1993 to 2002, the number of SYMT employees shrank from 27,000 to 11,000(2).
Since 2000, the number of employees in the company has basically varied with the expansion or contraction of the business, according to SMTCL’s data. A noteworthy phenomenon is that SMTCL also had to bear the burden of retired employees. During the period 2000-2020, retired employees accounted for an average of 64% of active employees. Although the financial reports do not disclose whether  retiree expenses borne by SMTCL are pension or benefits such as retirement allowance, living allowance, rent allowance etc. It seems likely SMTCL had considerable expenses for retirees.
Compared with peer companies in the industry, the asset-liability ratio of SMTCL after divesting a large number of assets is still significantly higher. While per capita operating revenue seems pretty good, the profitability is at an average level.
The i5 Venture (3)
While finances and human resources are the fundamental basis for an enterprise to operate, the key factor that determines its performance is always whether it can provide products and services that meet the market demand.
In the 1990s, SYMT faced growing competition in the market for lathes, drilling machines and boring machines, traditional product categories of SYMT. In 1994, ahead of its published schedule, Beijing reduced the import duty on machine tool products and CNC systems. As a result, imported machine tools flooded and quickly dominated the high-end market in China. Concurrently, private companies penetrated into middle-to-low-end market with lower prices.
The 2002-2012 period is the “golden decade” of China’s machine tool industry. With the accession to the WTO and the implementation of various reform measures, China’s economy grew rapidly and generated robust demand for machine tools. SYMT kept breaking new records, but its profit margin remained relatively low. The thin profit margin was due to a large extent to the company's complete reliance on expensive imports for the CNC control software -- the heart of machine tools.
Knowing the problems in producing low-value products, the strategy at SYMT has been: First become bigger "先做大”, to expand the volume and market share, and “then become stronger "再做强”, to improve profit margin and technical capability (4).
In 2008, after Guan Xiyou became the chairman of SYMG and SMTCL, he proposed an aggressive goal for SYMG to achieve sales of 20 billion yuan by 2012. Through product structure adjustment and technological breakthroughs, SYMG planned to upgrade its product lines within three years. Guan’s confidence was built on SYMG’s effort to develop its own CNC control software, a secret project that had begun one year before.
In 2012, Guan finally got the news from their i5 project leader that the system was successfully developed. After more than a year’s engineering application development, in February 2014, SYMG debuted i5 smart machine tools with industrial internet applications at “Shanghai Machine Tool Exhibition”. At this point, SYMG made a leap within Chinese companies to close the gap in CNC control software.
The background of i5 project：
In 2007, the sales of SYMG exceeded 10 billion yuan, ranking first in China and eighth in the world (5).At the beginning of 2006, when then President Hu Jintao first put forward the call for building an innovative country, the State Council subsequently listed the development of high-end CNC machine tools and basic manufacturing equipment as one of China’s 16 major scientific and technological projects.In July 2006, during a company inspection (see photo above), Li Changchun, then a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, learned that all of the CNC systems of SYMT were all imported. Li criticized SYMT on the spot for only making iron blocks and his criticism directly contributed to the launch of i5 project (6).In 2009, the National Science and Technology Major Project (04 Project) of “High-grade CNC Machine Tools and Basic Manufacturing Equipment” was organized and implemented by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology. The project aimed to form an in-house development capability and technological innovation system for high-end CNC machine tools and basic manufacturing equipment. The effort was designed to help industries such as aerospace, shipbuilding, automobiles and power generation equipment manufacturing to solve its bottleneck problems. SYMT and other leading machine tool companies in China including Kede CNC "科德数控", Huazhong CNC "华中数控, and Qinchuan Machine Tool "秦川机床", etc., participated in the 04 Project.

The i5 project is a gamble for SYMT and especially for Guan who made some special arrangements for the venture:
There are two main reasons why the development team is located in Shanghai instead of Shenyang: The strength in software talent and removing the shackles of the industry’s pre-existing stereotypes.Zhu Zhihao, the project leader, was fully authorized, and he only reported to Guan. The five-year development time and cost greatly exceeded Guan’s budget, but he persevered and took pressure from all sides.The project received adequate financial support, with cumulative funding of more than 1.1 billion yuan from 2007 to 2014.

There were no Herculean feats in the development of i5. It was a steady step=by=step process. What the R&D team has done in five years was to write code line by line, develop algorithms one by one, and solve problems one bug at a time.
A Failed Business Model
The narrowing of the technical gap does not guarantee success in the market. 2012 was the peak as well as the turning point for SYMT. That year, Gardner Intelligence announced that SYMG was the biggest machine tool company in the world in 2011 by sales revenue, and the i5 system was successfully developed. Since then, SYMT’s performance has  declined and suffered huge losses year after year. Finally, in 2019, it was judicially restructured due to insolvency. The i5 series failed to save SYMT, but instead became the last straw that crushed the group. After overcoming technical difficulties, SYMT did pass the test of the market.
When the i5 series was launched, Siemens, Fanuc and other global CNC system companies had cultivated in the Chinese market for more than 30 years, had advantages in technology, product performance, brand image and customer stickiness. The biggest challenge for SYMT, which was eager to promote its i5 series, was that it was difficult to break into the ecosystem built by global leaders. i5’s market recognition was not big enough to support SYMT’s ambitious sales expectations. If i5 had been launched after the outbreak of the U.S.-China trade war, perhaps it would have been more acceptable to Chinese users and benefited from local purchases.
In order to quickly grow the sales of i5 series, SYMT pioneered the business model of sharing machine tools. There are two versions of SYMT’s sharing model:
“Smart Manufacturing Centers” (SMC or 5D智造谷). SYMT partnered with local governments to build industrial parks equipped with shareable i5 machines tools. The tenants can use i5 machines and pay according to the time of usage. The largest SMC is in Jianhu County, Jiangsu Province, with a total of 800 shari i5 machine tools.Lease machine tools directly to users who already own plants and other facilities. These users are usually small in scale and produce general-purpose, high-volume basic mechanical parts.

2. Lease machine tools directly to users who already own plants and other facilities. These users are usually small in scale and produce general-purpose, high-volume basic mechanical parts.
To make the sales figures of i5 machines look good, all the items used for the sharing model were counted as units sold. However, these were actually intra-company transactions between SYMG and SMTCL, and the equipment usage fee or rent received was much lower than the amount of normal sales payments.
The assumption for the success of such a cash-burning model is that SYMT has sufficient capital and a good reputation in the users' industry. While users are asset-light, SYMT is extremely asset-heavy. In the context of China’s macro economy at that time, there were few places that could utilize the capacity generated by sharing machine tools, and i5 equipment utilization rates, in almost all SMCs, were less than 40%.
Carrying heavy bank loans, SYMT produced a large number of unsold i5 machine tools, and it could not generate positive cash flow. The more machines were put into the market, the bigger the losses. At the end of March 2019, SYMT’s consolidated assets were about 20 billion yuan, while its liabilities exceeded 37.5 billion yuan, the asset-liability ratio reached 190%. In 2019, SYMT had more than 10 billion yuan of short-term loans due, and its capital chain was on the verge of rupture and was forced to restructure.
Many observers have discussed the ups and downs of SYMT: some people question why SOEs like SYMT and local governments are so obsessed with scale expansion; some doubt the technical level of i5 products; and many criticize the bailout of an ailing SOE.
While all these views make sense, we should also point out that it is clearly not objective to attribute the cause of SYMT’s troubles to the i5 project. SYMT’s debt, compared to the contribution of i5’s R&D investment, didn't account for the company's mountain of debt, and i5 was just one part of the problem. Yet, SYMT’s attempt to develop the i5 pointed an R&D direction for other Chinese companies to develop their own high-end machine tools and CNC systems.
For example, established in 2008, Kede CNC, a privately controlled and listed company, now has its own intellectual property in five-axis CNC machine tools, high-end NC systems and key functional components. In assessing the cost and price reduction of foreign CNC systems after the release of i5, for China’s machine tool industry and users, i5 clearly delivered more gains than losses.
The failure of SYMT to adjust its business model in a timely manner was most likely due to the lack of rational and prudent business acumen among SYMT’s leadership, and the weakness of the Shenyang Municipal Government in exercising its responsibilities as the major shareholder.
The machine tool industry is characterized by specialization, refinement, differentiation and innovation (专精特新), and thus generally not suitable for mass production like iPhone components and final assembly. In order to be able to drive a local economy like Shenyang, this particular industrial cluster must be built gradually over time. It is difficult for the model -- “first become big and then become strong” -- to succeed in the machine tool industry.
In any case, as an explorer of SOE reform and self-dependent innovation, SYMT nevertheless deserves respect. Its ups and downs have given us a deeper understanding of the capabilities of SOEs and the boundaries of government intervention. Today, SYMT continues to pursue a way out of its financial woes. Additionally, the development of China’s economy and the reform of SOEs also faces new environments, opportunities and challenges.
