### China: Nantong on the Rise

27 April 2021|China, Economic Development
AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy and, in particular, life in China. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. We have sought to advance a conversation about the U.S.-China relationship, and a deep understanding of local economic development in China. We have been writing about the U.S.-China Trade War as it relates toinnovation in the Chinese economy;entrepreneurship in China today;anda series aboutChina’s Belt and Road Initiative. More recently, we have focused on thestrategic strength oflocal economic development in China’s 2nd and 3rd tier cities. This post adds to that conversation. – The Editorial Team

AtOn Global Leadership, we spend a lot of time thinking about economic development in China, with a focus on local governments and, in particular, municipal governments. This work converges with work about smart cities and the ways in which cities become innovative in the development of their urban infrastructure. Nantong (南通) is a famous historical and cultural heritage city. It has a history of more than a thousand years since it was found in 956CE. In modern China, Nantong is known for its firsts: first education school, textile school, embroidery school, drama school, folk museum, and weather station. Quite simply it is known as the "first city in modern China".
Located north of Shanghai, Nantong is in Jiangsu Province, and is the economic center and modern port city in north of Yangtze River Delta. It borders  the Yellow Sea on the east and the Yangtze River on the south. It is an important part of the Yangtze River city cluster, a gateway in the north of the Shanghai metropolitan area. Nantong administers three districts, one county, and three county-level cities, with a total area of 8,001 square kilometers (Shanghai is 6,340.5 sq km). In 2020, Nantong's GDP reached 1003.63 billion yuan. Thus, Nantong has entered China’s ranking cities of GDP trillion-yuan club (USD154 BN) together with the cities of Quanzhou, Jinan, Hefei, Xi’an, and Fuzhou. It ranks 21st among China’s top 30 cities.
Nantong has a significant role in developing the north side of the Yangtze River in the Jiangsu Province. This region had historically benefited from some industrial transfers from Shanghai and East Jiangsu, especially in those more labor intensive and low-tech industries. But in the last 10 years, Nantong has profited from better transportation and a new cluster of manufacturers in multiple industries. With modern agriculture, travel and leisure destinations, and local communities and social development, a vast potential service sector has begun to take shape.
The City of a Man (A Cultural History)
When it comes to Nantong, its history has been defined by one ground-breaking figure: a Confucian entrepreneur and businessman who made the town “the number one town of modern China” -- more than a hundred years ago.
Zhang Jian (张謇1853-1926), a native, won first prize in the imperial examination in 1894. After China lost the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895, he resolutely abandoned his official position in the National Academy and devoted himself to his ideal of saving the country through enterprise and education. With Zhang Jian’s strong will and determination, Nantong started the process of modernization and became a model restructure of industrialization, education and community building, which created the utopia town still observed today.
In 1895, Zhang Jian set up a large-scale Dah Sung Cotton Spinning and Weaving Co, Nantong. By the end of the Qing Dynasty, he had established a national industrial group with Dah Sung Co as the core, textile and light industry as the main focus, and agriculture materials as the base. The company consisted of yarn, fabrics, cooking oil, flour, and of some other 30 mills plus a steamboat shipping company and wharves.
Zhang Jian believed that a country's strength is built through education. For more than twenty years, he built the teacher’s college, textile institute, medical school, girls' schools, some three hundred vocational training schools, and first and secondary schools in town and throughout countryside. In order to supply books, he also owned a printing house.
At the time the small-town Nantong was populated with public parks, museums, theaters, western style hotels, bathhouses, and it often received famous visitors including philosopher John Dewey (1920).(See Figure 4.)
He was also occasionally summoned by Sun Yat-sen to work for the Republic, Zhang Jian devoted himself to the great cause of saving the country through industrialization and education. Zhang Jian promoted progress from the perspective of businessmen, and the fraternity and self-consciousness of Confucian scholars. His pioneering spirit of hands-on application left Nantong a rich cultural heritage and precious spiritual wealth.
Today’s Nantong is an “old” city. As of 2016, about 30% of the registered residents were aged 60 or more. The permanent residents aged 65 and older accounted for 19.2% of the population, the highest in the country. By definition, as early as 1982, Nantong became an aging society, 17 years earlier than the country. Nantong's elderly population will peak in the 2030s, when the number of people over 60 will be twice what it is today, or close to half of the total population.
It is also a city with stagnant population growth. Between 2010 - 2018, Nantong's permanent registered population kept decreasing, so did its working population.
A city with no population growth yet continued outflow, and with a serious aging population, is definitely not optimistic about its development. But Nantong seems an outlier. For the last ten years, its GDP has been soaring steadily. It's now in the class of trillion yuan cities.
A History of Family Planning
First, Nantong's population stagnancy is because its natural growth rate is too low.
In the first population census in 1953, the total population of Nantong reached 5.0732 million, ranking first in Jiangsu Province. The population density was 634 per square kilometer, 70% more than the provincial average. Because of the disadvantage of land scarcity, Nantong began to implement its family planning policy in the 1970s.
Due to the remarkable effect of population control, Nantong was awarded a "Model City of Family Planning". Over the years, the concept of the one-child policy has taken root in generation after generation. Coupled with the rising cost of raising children, the local people have formed a tacit understanding that "it’s good to have only one child".
Although the one-child policy has been gradually lifted since 2013, the stimulating effect on Nantong's birth rate has been very little. From 2002 to 2019, the natural population growth rate of Nantong maintained a record of negative growth for 18 consecutive years. In 2019 the natural growth was -20,974.
Second, Nantong's migration growth rate is also low. Since 1991, the pattern of population flow in Nantong has shown that the outflow is greater than the inflow, and with a large number of young and educated people leaving the city. The average net outflow is  300,000 per year.
Nantong is the "hometown of construction" enterprises and with a long history, with 1.6 - 1.8 million construction employees and more than 2,000 construction companies. Of course, the local market cannot accommodate the size of the industry, so many builders work nationally and in overseas markets. According to statistics, of every 100 skyscrapers in Shanghai, 15 were built by construction companies from Nantong.
The construction industry has driven a large number of young people to out-of-town jobs for up to six months or more at a time, which sharply drops the workforce population throughout the year. According to city statistics, the construction industry accounts for 43.3% of the outflow population.(2019 Sampling Survey by Nantong Statistics Bureau)
However, this uneven population flow is not the most troublesome factor to city leaders. The biggest issue facing Nantong day is the loss of local educated talent. The educational tradition in Nantong is very strong. In 2018, Nantong students’ college acceptance was 92% for those who had participated in the college-entrance exam, and its 1st group (better ranking) universities acceptance was 53%.
There is a local saying: a train load goes out for college but only a bus load graduates and comes back. So, no matter how strong the K-12 education system is in the city, it's just training the talent for the rest of China. Of course, Nantong is worried!
The inflow of population is about two-thirds of the outflow, only barely filling the gap. The data shows the net population outflow of Nantong in 2019 was 280,200, a decrease of 67,200 compared with that of 2010. The return of the migrant workers is the main offset for the continuous reduction of the net outflow of population in the city.
Economic Enclave of Shanghai
Despite the city’s shrinking and aging population, it hasn't had a negative impact on the growth of economic development on the whole. Why? The reasons are  complicated, but let’s list a few.
One, Nantong has a particularly good geographic location, which is a critical advantage. There are only two cities along the Yangtze River economic belt adjacent to both sea and river; one is Shanghai and the other is Nantong. In the 1980s, Nantong was competitive with Suzhou, Wuxi, and Changzhou in the forefront of economic reform. However, due to the transportation bottleneck caused by the ferry, the gap between Nantong and southern Jiangsu cities grew large, and gradually it fell out the first pack.
Local officials realized the most important strategic focus for Nantong should be to break the traffic bottleneck in order to be further integrated with southern Jiangsu, and, most importantly, connected with Shanghai. In 2003, the local government invited a Hong Kong group to invest a great deal of money in the development of the Yangkou sea port. Once the port was opened, the big projects such as Jiangsu LNG, Singapore Golden Eagle Group, Huaneng International (power), and other projects came to land in succession. Today, Nantong ports have a strong tie with the Shanghai International Shipping Center, with the cargo through-put ranked 14th (2018) in China.
From 2008 to 2011, two bridges were completed over the Yangtze River. Last year a high-speed rail line from Shanghai reached Nantong, making the trip less than 1.5 hours. Nantong finally realized a hundred-year dream. Nantong was no longer "difficult to access".
With the transportation improvement, more and more external investors are looking at Nantong and seeking cooperation. Nantong began to receive the industrial transfers from Shanghai and southern Jiangsu.
As of 2017, Nantong has seven industrial parks cooperating with Shanghai, four with southern Jiangsu, and three with other overseas partners, theXinhua Dailyreported. According to local officials, "these industrial parks bring the successful experience, superior resources, advanced concepts, and high-quality projects of Shanghai and southern Jiangsu to Nantong, and become a new economic growth pole of Nantong".
Reportedly, Nantong’s 30% of high-level talents; 40% of venture capital firm connections were introduced from Shanghai; 50% of enterprises have cooperation with Shanghai, 60% of the goods are imported and exported through Shanghai; and 70% of its farm and sideline products supply the Shanghai market. Since 2016, there are 400 industrial projects over 1 billion RMB and 20 over 10 billion RMB, which have landed in Nantong.
There is no doubt that Nantong has become an important gateway of Jiangsu for connecting with Shanghai and has become an economic enclave of Shanghai as well.
Now, in the 14FYP Shanghai is positioned to become an "international science and technology innovation center". Nantong has a good industrial base and can offer to assist Shanghai with the non-core functions. Nantong formed three key pillar industries, namely high-end textile, marine shipbuilding, and information-technology electronics, as well as three main emerging industries, intelligent equipment, new materials, and new energy (and EV).
Two, Nantong’s private enterprises are well-developed and active.
The private sector economy is also the mainstay of Nantong’s development. In 2003, it advanced the goal of "striving to create a city with the largest private economy in Jiangsu Province". By 2019, Nantong's private economy had created 68% of the city's GDP, 75% of the tax revenue, absorbed more than 90% of the urban working population, and was definitely in the forefront of the province.
In this environment, the local government created many local enterprises, which became the front runners of the industries they are in: Zhongtian Technology (ZTT), the leader in China's fiberoptic cable field; NT Fujitsu Micro Electronics, which is world class in IC assembly and test; Tiemao Glass, China's leading supplier of special glass products; and Zhongxing Energy Equipment Co., which accounts for more than 80% of the market share of seamless, stainless-steel tubes for nuclear power plants in China.
Three, Nantong has actively sought foreign capital and loans.
From 2003, Nantong began to leapfrog in attracting foreign investment. Foreign investment utilization jumped to 2nd place in the province in 2007, and ranked among the top 10 in  actual capital recipients nationally that year. Nantong's total actual foreign investment utilization reached 26 billion US dollars between 2008-2018 periods, second only to Dongguan, the world's factory, and surpassed provincial capitals such as Xi'an, Hefei, Jinan, and Fuzhou.
By taking on the role of a prime recipient of industrial transfer of domestic and foreign capital and industry, Nantong returned to the first-class array of Jiangsu Province, with its GDP reaching trillion RMB.
The Growth of a Service Industry
In recent years, tertiary industries have become the main force to absorb employment. The more developed a service industry, the more high-level jobs the city can provide and attract talent. Thee ratio of tertiary industry in Nantong is relatively low compared to other cities of similar status or development phase. In addition, Nantong’s rather traditional industrial structure is no longer attractive to new workers. This issue is facing many other Chinese cities, which had early success over last thirty years with manufacturing.
When talking about China moving from manufacturing towards consumption-led growth (消费升级), much of the focus is on services with more knowledge-concentration, professional skills, and management with differentiation. These reflect better medicine and healthcare, education and research, environmental protection, social security, sports and entertainment, financial services, etc. In other words, it is a transition from labor or capital intensive to human capital intensive. This will transform the city’s expanding structure, industrial structure, population flow, and urban forms.
Nantong leaders think the structural change facing the city can be completed by upgrading from manufacturing and basic processing to high precision and automation, but they will be delaying de-industrialization and avoiding the so-called “middle income trap”. Today, Nantong’s per capita income is already over USD20,000, a new phase of development is inevitable. The real essence of the growth mode change is from manufacturing to services. Many expect to see a lot more human capital and funding go into this tertiary industry, although the statistics in Figure 7 do not reflect the change.
In October 2019, Nantong officially joined the talent-grabbing war. The "zero threshold" of talent with university degrees or above will be welcomed to settle in Nantong. Undergraduates who are employed in Nantong for the first time can receive a subsidy of 1,000 yuan per month, as long as they enroll in social security for more than six months; For the qualified top talents who come to Nantong to start a business, a one-time housing purchase subsidy of up to 1.5 million yuan will be given as a perk.
To secure its geographical importance, Nantong proposed a new airport, which is jokingly referred to as “Shanghai's third airport”. The opening of Shanghai-Nantong rail, the North Riverside high-speed railway connection to other northern Jiangsu cities, is in full swing of construction. All these have given an important strategic position to Nantong in the integration of Yangtze River Delta, all designed to support the next growth phase.
