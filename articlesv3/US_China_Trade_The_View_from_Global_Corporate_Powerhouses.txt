### U.S.-China Trade: The View from Global Corporate Powerhouses

6 September 2024|China, Economic Development, Supply Chain, Trade
AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy and, in particular, life in China. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. We have written about economic development in China and China’s economic reforms, U.S.-China relations, China’s changing role in the global political economy, and the history and current state of Chinese politics. In this post, we look at a few brands that play critical roles in China specifically and in the global economy more generally. These issues are important and broad, as they stretch across the disciplines of manufacturing, global supply chains and global markets, and social media and technology. To keep our discussion focused, we look at a few companies that have deep ties to both countries, Apple, Tesla, and General Motors. We have written and spoken about these issues previously (see, e.g.,here,here, andhere), and we continue that conversation in this post.
The United States and China, the world’s two largest economies, are deeply and intimately intertwined and have been for more than four decades. But this is not a static relationship, and it has been both deepening and becoming more complex.
It also has become a critical issue for major multinational companies because they have significant investments and market exposure in both countries, and the current tensions between the two nations present opportunities as well as challenges.
As these tensions between the U.S. and China continue to evolve, global powerhouse corporations are actively adapting their strategies to protect their market positions, diversify risks, and navigate the difficulties posed by this thorny relationship between two superpowers.
It is on this last point that we will focus on in this piece: How are U.S. gold-chip companies like Apple, Tesla, and General Motors faring in China right now? And what does it tell us about the U.S.-China trade war, in specific, and U.S.-China tensions more generally?
The latest headlines are a mixed bag in terms of how companies are faring in the global tit-for-tat trade disputes between the two countries, but they do give one pause as we contemplate the future. A few examples:

There is an important historical context here, and it is useful to review that before diving into the state of the relationships between corporate powerbrokers and China and the U.S., and the impact of those complex relations in both countries.
The Important Context
This is a remarkable time for U.S.-China relations. In fact, it might be the most critical moment in the last 50 years. Over five decades ago, in 1972, President Nixon visited the People’s Republic of China, thus opening the door for a period of constructive engagement with the world’s most populous nation.
Deng Xiaoping pushed the relationship deeper, visiting President Carter in 1979, inaugurating Communist China’s new era of “economic opening.” The era of engagement continued to gain momentum during the Clinton presidency, as President Clinton worked to de-link China’s trade status from its human rights record, thus paving the way for Permanent Normal Trade Relations status (PNTR) and China’s entry in World Trade Organization (WTO).
China entered the WTO in 2001, and it would soon become the world’s second largest economy and the U.S.’s largest trading partner. The interdependence between our economies grew over the next decade-plus: American companies like Apple, WalMart, Tesla, and many others became deeply embedded in and dependent upon China’s manufacturing supply chain, and China became the largest exporter of products to the United States. As China’s manufacturing supply chain became more and more sophisticated, American companies grew increasingly dependent upon its largest trading partner.
Relations between our two nations began to take a dark turn with the election of President Trump in 2016. Invoking Section 301 of the U.S. Trade Act of 1974, over the next four years, the Trump administration levied tariffs that would eventually amount to nearly $300 billion. Somewhat ironically (though perhaps not surprisingly), these tariffs did little to harm China or shift manufacturing and purchasing to other venues. Most often these tariffs simply increased prices for U.S. consumers, thus hurting American citizens more than anyone.
Nevertheless, China continued to be blamed for the struggles faced by U.S. consumers. The anti-China rhetoric from the Trump/MAGA faction seems only to have grown over the eight years since President Trump’s election, as the MAGA faction has sought to scapegoat China for the ills of the U.S. economy.
In an interview with David Brooks, a columnist withThe New York Times,MAGA guru Steve Bannon noted: "President Trump is a kindhearted person. He’s a people person, right? On China, I think he admires Xi Jinping. But we’re super-hawks. We want to see an elimination of the Chinese Communist Party."
The anxiety over China and its increasingly powerful economy is not solely the province of MAGA acolytes. Under the Biden administration, Congress passed the Science and Chips Act, delivering subsidies to U.S. producers of high technology hardware, and prohibiting Chinese customers and supply chain partners access to semiconductors. Additionally, there have been growing tensions over Taiwan. And, indeed, these last two issues flow together, as Taiwan is the home to the world’s most powerful and sophisticated chip manufacturing company, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC).
The last couple of months have brought a fair amount of drama. We won’t go through all of that drama here, as we have written about this recently (hereandhere). We have written about this synergistic and, at times, conflictual relationships. It is a relationship worth examining, as are the activities that add to it and diminish it.
The U.S. provocations in its China relationship are many: Trump's election in 2016, anti-China fomenting; pro-U.S. neoclassical economic theory and free market capitalism; Trump’s $300 billion in tariffs; Biden’s attempts at reconciliation; Yellen “schooling” Chinese leaders on how free market capitalism works; Biden’s $18 billion in tariffs on Electric Vehicles and supporting components; the nomination of GOP Vice Presidential candidate J.D. Vance, who openly uses terms like “stealing jobs” and “slave labor,” revealing his shallow understanding of Chinese and global manufacturing supply chains.
For discussion of the tense trade relations over the last five years, see, for example,here,here,here, andhere. For discussion of the strength of China’s unique capitalist mixed-economy model (from which the entire world should learn), see, for example,here,here, andhere. For the ways in which specific companies are closely tied to and dependent upon China, seehere. To better understand that relationship, we dive deeply into relationships between three global giants and China.
There are also specific historical, cultural, institutional, and deal-specific issues for each of these companies. Here we break down some of those fascinating issues, and their influence in the marriage of U.S. multinationals and China.
Apple: Apple’s relationship with China is special. Since Apple entered China in 2001, the company built a business that is anchored by what is among the most complex and sophisticated supply chains in the world. In addition, over the course of more than a decade of business in the world's most populous nation, Apple became an iconic brand in China, and, by some reports, it had come to be among the most coveted luxury brand in the country. As with other places across the globe, Apple fans will queue for long hours outside of Apple stores waiting for the opportunity to lay their hands on the newest Apple product.
Apple’s situation went through a transformation with the ascension of President Xi Jinping. Suddenly, for a while at least, Apple seemed under fire. With a difficultConsumer-Day-CCTV moment(March 15, 2013, the day after President Xi assumed office) and then another public admonition of Apple’s lack of attention to Corporate Social Responsibility in the internal CSR report released by the Chinese Government. Apple was indeed under fire.
But the world’s most profitable company righted the ship. Knowing how dependent the company and its shareholders were on China’s world-beating manufacturing supply chain, Apple conceded. The company agreed to fixed-asset investment in China at a level that had never before been committed. They also agreed toR&D Centers in ShenzhenandData Centers in Guizhou. And the ship was righted. We were all friends and collaborators again.
But there is still spillover from Apple technical knowledge and supply chain and operations knowhow to the suppliers who are also working for other domestic brands. Huawei, Oppo, Vivo, Xiaomi are all learning and benefitting from Apple Operations Engineers being in China, teaching their suppliers how to build efficient supply chains to construct different components that fit inside of ALL smartphones. So, Apple has made up and made good with the Chinese Government. But Chinese consumers are still bullish and proud of Chinese, China-made products. So, Apple can stay, and we will learn from them what we can, but when our Chinese products are equal or near equal to the Apple brand in terms of functionality, we are buying those! It is an interesting moment for global manufacturing, global learning, and continued collaboration between powerful US corporations and brands and their Chinese and global markets.
General Motors: This one takes us back a bit. We have all been working in China, strategically advising foreign multinationals operating, since the early 1990s. But, as noted above, this history has changed a great deal over the last three decades. Back in the heyday of tech-transfer Joint Venture partnerships, one of the big deals that was formulated during the 1990s was the Joint Venture Partnership between General Motors and the Shanghai Automotive Investment Corporation (SAIC). This was a noteworthy and important venture because of its exceptional nature. This may not seem exceptional today, but back then, foreign multinational investments in China – in certain sectors, specifically sectors that had important influence over the development of China’s manufacturing supply chains (e.g., automotives!) – would only be led by State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) that were controlled by the national government. So, for example, in the automotive sector, up until 1997, you would only ever see joint ventures between foreign companies and centrally controlled SOEs. To be clear, there were other ventures that appeared to be local, for example Shanghai-VW, which was established in 1985. However, the difference here, is that Shanghai-VW’s “Leading Organization” [zhuguan bumen] was the Ministry in Beijing; for SAIC, the “Leading Organization” [zhuguan bumen] was the Bureau in Shanghai. Thus, local leadership instead of national leadership.
The SAIC-GM deal is set to expire in June 2027. And GM brands are down in China right now. Our early analysis is that GM represents a view of American brands that are falling behind [落后]. Other brands like Apple and Tesla might be caught up in the mix of U.S.-China relations and tensions, but they seem to “get it.” They are moving quickly with thinking about what it means to be “in China for China,” a concept that we hear more and more often in our discussions about doing business in China today. In our humble opinion, GM needs to apply some innovative, strategic thinking at this point.
Tesla: Tesla’s relationship builds in interesting ways on both of the relationships above. As we have writtenpreviously, “Tesla entered China in 2019, with great fanfare and a giga-factory in Shanghai’s Lingang Free Trade Zone. The local government did its best to match Tesla's needs, and Tesla grasped this life-saving straw, a hedging for both to win on their part. Tesla needs production, and Shanghai wants an industry. Tesla got a low favorable interest rate, as low as 3.9%, which has made many domestic enterprises envious. China Merchants Bank provided Tesla with a large loan of 5 billion yuan.
Note that it is an unsecured loan agreement, although we all know that the whole Shanghai government is behind it. There was much buzz about this deal because Tesla was allowed to enter China as a Wholly Owned Foreign Enterprise (WOFE) in an industry where Chinese-Foreign Equity Joint Ventures are the standard model for operation. Tesla was allowed to proceed with its model, and we can be sure many promises were made about the company’s reliance upon and improvements to China’s manufacturing supply chain in this important market segment.
During the building of the facility, the Shanghai mayor and vice mayor had championed Tesla for problem solving and project progress, and the relationship has only deepened from there. Just last month, Tesla announced plans to build a new megapack battery factory – also in Lingang – deepening its partnership with and dependence on China. Asreportedby Yashwardhan Jain, ‘Tesla aims to take advantage of China’s world-leading battery supply chain to increase its output and reduce costs of its lithium-ion battery units of megapack.’ From the laying of the foundation in 2019 to when the first Model 3 rolled off the assembly line in Tesla Shanghai Giga Factory in January 2020, only a year had passed. The fact that it only took a year for this process to unfold is a remarkable achievement and testament to the efficiency of China’s manufacturing supply chain, and the desire from both parties to succeed.”
We view this as a significant moment for Tesla, for U.S.-China relations, and for global trade. In the last few months, both Tim Cook and Elon Musk have made treks to China to pay homage to and solidify their companies’ relationships with the Chinese Government. Both leaders clearly view U.S.-China relations (business and political) as being tied to their close adherence to building these relationships. In March 2024, Cook showed up in China to play host to the opening of Shanghai’s Jingan Store and to visit the Shenzhen R&D centers. In April 2024, Musk followed suit, surprising China with a collaborative visit, which included meetings with Li Qiang and other officials.
What does all this mean geopolitically? Our fundamental view is that we don’t get to pretend that free markets reign supreme, and the market will decide which products are the best quality and will sell the best. It turns out that consumers are subjects of and subject to the messages they receive from the cultural, social, and institutional environments in which they are embedded.
China is home to the world’s most sophisticated manufacturing supply chain – a supply chain that allows companies like Apple and Tesla to be innovative and profitable deep into their futures. Sorry guys, Apple and Tesla can’t just move their production to India or to the United States. Just ain’t gonna happen. The only way it could happen would require significant investment and forty years of smart development to build a sophisticated manufacturing supply chain to compete with China. Plus, China is the world’s largest consumer market. So, we need to continue to work together going forward. Engagement, engagement, engagement.
