### China: Leaders Lead, Even When It Hurts

17 February 2021|Coronavirus, Leadership Development
AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy and, in particular, life in China. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. We have sought to advance a conversation about the U.S.-China relationship, and a deep understanding of local economic development in China. We have written extensively about COVID-19 in the past year and how China has responded to the pandemic. This post seeks to extend our discussions about China and COVID-19 to look at how it has impacted its global reputation.  – The Editorial Team
In an era where there is so little geopolitical trust, it’s not surprising that China balked at the requests from World Health Organization (WHO) investigators to obtain raw, personalized data on COVID-19 cases from the earliest days of the pandemic. Scientists wanted to discover its origins, but China felt they were on a fishing expedition.
After all, the investigators had already spent a month in China meeting with scientists and reviewing data. And scientists just wanted to “check the math” of the aggregated data they received because they didn’t quite trust Chinese conclusions about how and when the coronavirus began.

China’s reaction reflects an understandable gap in trust, but it should set aside its misgivings and concerns and deliver the personalized data to accede to the greater good. That’s what global leaders do, and China has become a global leader, whether the rest of the world wants to admit it or not.
There is no irony that as China was rebuffing the WHO, the United States was expressing its own skepticism about the WHO’s past investigations in China. President Joe Biden has rejoined the WHO after former President Trump pulled out, but the Biden administration issued a pointed statement about keeping the WHO to the “highest standards” and that protecting its “credibility is a paramount priority.” The West is demanding efficiency from the WHO and transparency from China.
“It is imperative that this report be independent, with expert findings free from intervention or alteration by the Chinese government,” Biden national security advisor Jake Sullivan wrote in a statement about the pending origins report. “Going forward, all countries, including China, should participate in a transparent and robust process for preventing and responding to health emergencies — so that the world learns as much as possible as soon as possible.”
On the surface, this scientific skirmish over disaggregated versus aggregated data seems fairly small on a global scale. China has proved to be a model government in containing the pandemic. It’s 1.4 billion population has seen about 4,600 deaths. The United States, with a population one-fourth the size of China’s, has crossed the 500,000 death mark in February.
Our view is that the more important thing at this point is the methods for how you control the pandemic, using tools such as contact tracing, monitoring people, and widespread testing. China has excelled at those, and it would benefit the rest of the world to look more closely at its successes there rather than focusing on the past.
But I know that scientists and researchers are eager to know the origins to not lay blame but to understand how to prevent the next coronavirus. Early in the pandemic, China ignored offers from experts to help study the outbreak. China refused, and it was an opportunity lost then and now to lead the way forward globally with the science.
In all the economic numbers that matter, China is leading the world in economic recovery, in economic growth, and in global trade. As China continues to grow as a leader, it also needs to lead in sharing the data that constitutes the backbone of global decision-making and policy-making. Transparency will be an essential factor in China's ascendancy if it hopes to lead the world.
