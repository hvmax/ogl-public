### Entrepreneurship and Everyday Leaders: China’s Jiayin (Mia) Wang

23 December 2020|China, Everyday Leadership
AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. Several of us have advised companies and taught about leadership over theyears, and we have developed atheoryof leadership that takes us away from the big personality or charismatic leader to the person on the ground fighting for his or her team, community, or family. In this post, we seek to continue our advancement of a view of everyday leadership in this day and age by showcasing an Everyday Leader. – The Editorial Team

Maia Active, the 150 million renminbi or $22.8 million ath-leisure start-up, may be tiny by global brand standards, but it has growing influence in China’s active wear market. A sportswear company that emphasizes both style and comfort, Maia Active designs with Asian women in mind and broke through in China before western companies could get a solid foothold in this niche.
The brainchild of designer and founder Ou (Lisa) Yirou and her partner CEO Wang (Mia) Jiayin, Maia Active serves the luxury active wear market and has been called the Chinese Lululemon. Both women believed that western brands didn’t adequately fit or serve the needs of Chinese women, so Maia Active was more attuned with their physical and cultural needs. Its signature products are Perfect-Fit and Cloud leggings, which are its top bestsellers.

Recently, Wang was interviewed byWomen’s Wear Daily(WWD). The interview reminded us of a brief period in which one of us was part of a team that shadowed, interviewed, and filmed Wang in order to tell her story. At the time, that team was developing a product to help a foreign multinational better understand the peculiarities of the Chinese market and Chinese consumer behavior. We came across Wang and Ou in 2017 shortly after they had completed a successful $6 million fundraising round, with a number of backers including Sequoia Capital.
On Global Leadership’s theory ofEveryday Leadersposits that leaders are forged in the day-to-day work of organizations. But they’re also individuals who see opportunity where others don’t, and they have an internal drive that allows them to explore their creative entrepreneurship in ways both novel and significant.
In this case, Ou and Wang had become convinced that famous western brands didn’t think deeply enough about the Chinese market. As Wang explained, “For people like us, who want brands [that make] Asian-fitting activewear, where are they? Lululemon, Nike, Adidas, Western brans or like mega brands, they make their own products and they don’t really fit Asians. So, we were thinking, why don’t we start something to do activewear but only for Asians. And that’s why we started Maia.”

Wang is an impressive young entrepreneur – thoughtful, intelligent, highly educated, and brimming with confidence. When we interviewed her, Wang spoke in great detail about how they think about their target market: “So, first of all, we use Asian body-type data for our mannequins. And when we do the adjusting for sizes, we use the data pool for Asians. So, for example, if you are cutting from small to medium for Caucasians, it actually is going to be like 3 centimeters. But for Asians, it’s probably only 2.5. This type of difference makes our products fit Asians perfectly… [But] we’re not just talking about fitting, we are also talking about design, color, experience.”
In her December 2020 interview with WWD, Wang noted: “The big brands are doing consumer research annually, but we are doing it every single day and every single minute. We design everything from the consumer needs.”
Raised in Inner Mongolia, Wang, 31, went to the United States for university and graduated from The Ohio State University with a dual degree in business and mathematics. After a stint in New York City as Victoria Secret’s first Asian buyer, she returned home to China. There, she became employee No. 24 at Xiaohongshu or RED, a China e-commerce platform with some 300 million registered users, mostly young and female. After just 18 months at RED, she made the jump to being an entrepreneur, co-founding Maia Active, and hasn’t looked back.
This homegrown company, which started on Tmall, a Chinese platform for selling consumer goods, is riding what could be a $250 billion renminbi wave, the total market size for female sports apparel in China in 2019. It’s expected to double in size over the next five years as active wear trends accelerate in China and young women become a sizable consumer base. The company, which is expecting to hit profitability in 2021, has already opened popular off-line locations.

“Honestly, it’s important to reach profitability next year,” Wang told WWD. “We hit our forecast and we are very happy with that. The reason we are breaking even and not profitable this year is because we are investing in our products, in our innovation lab. We are spending a lot in our payroll to get really good people join us to help us build up this business better. Our marketing cost is less than 15 percent, and our P&L term by term, it’s very healthy. We are building up the bottom line every year.”
Even as it looks to take advantage of that growth, the company has adopted clever campaign elements in its active wear to maintain its cheerful outlook and create new touchpoints with its consumers. For example, it prints encouraging mottos on the inside of its clothing, such as “I don’t sweat, I sparkle” and “It’s good to be me.”
Wang has the confidence of a rising star who understands her business as well as the competition, and more importantly, she has a strategy for how to take them on. Her business philosophy also illuminates a significant shift in the thinking of younger generations in China. If the older generation grew up with the view that the best of capitalism originates in the West, the current generation no longer thinks that’s true.
In our 2017 interviews, Wang spoke directly about her generation’s growing sense of pride as entrepreneurs and capitalists: “We have the confidence we can do a brand only for Asians. I wouldn’t really imagine in my mom and dad’s generation would have that type of confidence. Even nowadays, every time I shop with my mom – like in Paris or other Western countries – I tell her, ‘Okay, this clothing is really pretty, but it doesn’t really fit you.’ But she still wants to go buy the Western brands because she thinks it’s better. She still thinks that way, and I don’t think I will ever change her. She still thinks like Western brands are the best, and Asian brands can’t really compete. But for my generation and for people like me, who actually had the luxury to study abroad at an early age and get a really good education, we actually have the capability to make something really good, with great quality, with great image, and do the business right.”
Wang also described an interesting gender dynamic in her entrepreneurial journey: “Most of the entrepreneurs in China from the last generation or like ten years ago, they are male. My partner is also a girl, and we started to do fundraising and we met with so many investors. Lots of feedback we got was always like, ‘Oh, you are girls and you will get emotional, you will fight with each other.’ And that was super helpful for us, because my partner and I were like, ‘OK, we’re gonna make it, because like they don’t believe in us.’”
This thinking about Everyday Leadership might seem mundane and quotidian in comparison to flashier manifestos of the charismatic leader who pops fully formed from a mother’s womb. What we are proposing is a simple framework – built on a deep understanding of human behavior and interpersonal relationships – that’s sole purpose is creating an effective organization that can deliver on a vision. Wang and Ou have an elegantly simple vision. As Wang put it, “I think the Chinese consumers respond to us better, because we know the market better. And we know the market better, because we are local.” And they have worked tirelessly to build an organization that is executing against that vision.
In Everyday Leadership, sometimes the best choice is not counting on a single individual to save the day, but rather looking for a more versatile, creative, and universal leadership that engages everyone, every day. Wang and Ou found that in themselves, and they continue to rediscover it as they enjoy their early success and look toward an even more successful future. Pretty good for entrepreneurs who were dismissed as mere “girls” by investors and competitors.
