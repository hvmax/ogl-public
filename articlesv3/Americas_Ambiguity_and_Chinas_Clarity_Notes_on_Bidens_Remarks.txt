We hope these breaking news insights from our OGL team members will help illuminate the events of the day and provide the depth needed to understand global political, economic and cultural transitions and transformations. But this post digs a little deeper into this story, and explores the implications of the comments President Biden recently made about the China-Taiwan relationship.
“Don’t do anything more than three times” (事不过三), according to a popular Chinese idiom. The message implies that a person has made a mistake, and that mistake shouldn't be repeated again and again. It's a lesson President Joe Biden should take to heart when it comes to China and Taiwan.
In Tokyo on May 23, 2022, Biden said that U.S. forces would defend Taiwan militarily if China attempted to take control of the self-ruled island by force. It is one of the most forceful presidential statements in support of Taiwan in decades.
Within just nine months, it was the third time Biden made such an explicit pledge to defend Taiwan, which is seen as being contrary to the decades-long policy of "Strategic Ambiguity".
During an ABC News interview last August, Biden put Taiwan in the same category as other countries where Washington has explicit defense commitments. Two months later, the president told a CNN town hall, “Yes, we have a commitment to do that” when asked about using the U.S. military to defend Taiwan.
STEPHANOPOULOS: You talked about our adversaries, China and Russia. You already see China telling Taiwan, "See? You can't count on the Americans." (LAUGH)
BIDEN: Sh-- why wouldn't China say that? Look, George, the idea that w-- there's a fundamental difference between Taiwan, South Korea, NATO. We are in a situation where they are in-- entities we've made agreements with based on not a civil war they're having on that island or in South Korea, but on an agreement where they have a unity government that, in fact, is trying to keep bad guys from doin' bad things to them.
We have made-- kept every commitment. We made a sacred commitment to Article Five that if in fact anyone were to invade or take action against our NATO allies, we would respond. Same with Japan, same with South Korea, same with-- Taiwan. It's not even comparable to talk about that.(1)
Biden’s answer certainly raised the adrenaline levels of reporters on the scene in Tokyo. The United States has long been a supporter of Taiwan, so to some, this might have seemed like an obvious answer to a simple question. However, the fact is, this was a radical and, dare we say, irresponsible answer. International media used "breaking news" to report Biden's remarks, and some people suggested it could be an end to the "Strategic Ambiguity" on Taiwan that the U.S. has long pursued. Like in previous cases, as soon as Biden's voice fell, Biden administration officials were out, claiming there had been no change in American policy.
Despite being a seasoned politician, Biden as a president and a U.S. senator before has made a habit of speaking without a diplomatic filter. As a senator, those slips of the tongue had less impact than as a president, of course.
More importantly, it is hard to justify three "slips of the tongue" on the same critical topic from the American president. Has Biden told a truth he shouldn't have said, that the United States intends to abandon decades of "Strategic Ambiguity" on  Taiwan? People believe they are being signaled Biden's intentions from his blunt response--and not from the clean-up comments by his senior staff.
After the outbreak of the Russian-Ukrainian war, the concerns among the international community about a military conflict in the Taiwan Strait have risen sharply. On May 5, the U.S. State Department updated its webpage on U.S.-Taiwan relations, removing expressions such as “Taiwan is part of China”, and “The United States does not support Taiwan independence”. The main purpose of Biden's East Asia trip was to emphasize that the U.S. will not be distracted by the Ukraine war, and will still focus on Indo-Pacific affairs. Therefore, we can imagine if Biden has not shown a strong position on the question, it would be difficult for Asian allies to have full confidence in the U.S. with regard to regional affairs.
From the quick clarification by the White House, it looks like the Biden administration is not ready to give up the "Strategic Ambiguity" that has been in place fora while. The president’s remarks were apparently signaling a deterrence approach to Beijing. However, even if the U.S. reiterates that its Taiwan policy will remain unchanged, Biden is remarkably truthful about what the U.S. would do in the event of China militarily entering Taiwan.
“No one ever doubts that I mean what I say...”, said Biden, who often thinks he’s his own best messenger. But this is the true headache for the President because many people in his own White House don’t always agree and the Chinese take his verbal miscues seriously. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin expressed “strong dissatisfaction and resolute opposition” to Biden’s comments. He further added, “China will take firm action to safeguard its sovereignty and security interests, and we will do what we say.”
The People's Liberation Army's Eastern Theater Command  recently organized joint war-preparedness patrols and combat training exercises around the Taiwan Island, China's Defense spokesperson made it very clear, "these are necessary actions taken targeting the U.S.-Taiwan collusion ..." The PLA is on high alert and ready to take all necessary measures to resolutely thwart any external forces interference and secessionist attempts for "Taiwan independence" (2).
Three days after Biden's remarks, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken returned to ambiguity rather than clarity by calling for vigorous competition with China to preserve the existing global order while not seeking a "Cold War ". He was still trapped in the wave made by his president. Many Chinese just don’t believe what he said, because they have seen the U.S. has already entered a cold war in a different format with China in terms of diplomatic, economic, political, and information dimensions. On social media in China, people seem to have reached some consensus on the U.S.-China relationship:
First, no matter what China does, it is unlikely to change Washington's positioning of China as a “strategic adversary.” Regardless of what has been said by Biden or Blinken, there is no difference between “vigorous competition” or “cold war”.Second, it is still possible to avoid complete deterioration of China-U.S. relations. China needs to make more efforts to stabilize the relationship and reduce the speed of its deterioration. The key is that China must keep opening up and maintaining non-governmental exchanges and economic and trade cooperation with America and other countries.Third, the most fundamental way for China to compete with the U.S. is to do its own thing, and do it well. It is crucial for China to grow its economy and promote innovation. Many people believe that China's zero-COVID policy on Omicron has tarnished China's economic halo.Fourth, whether the U.S. will militarily assist Taiwan or not is not determined by the words of a U.S. president, U.S. officials, or U.S. politicians, but rather is determined by the interests of America and the consequences of a hot war with China. What China needs to prepare for is a direct military confrontation with the U.S. when Taiwan hits China's red line and other related consequences. In this regard, Beijing has a lot to thank Moscow for.

The strategic competition between the U.S. and China is multi-faceted, but the game in the Taiwan Strait is definitely zero-sum because there are only two players: China and the United States. While it is an arena that will end some day with one side quitting completely, we believe over the next 10 years the situation in the Taiwan Strait will remain in a dangerous equilibrium.
Currently, U.S.-China relations are at a low point with little prospect for improvement. As Beijing and Washington both face political and public pressure domestically, there is an increased risk of turning "Strategic Ambiguity" to "Strategic Clarity". However, walking away from such ambiguity could trigger a major geopolitical crisis. Unless there are major changes in China, our view is that Beijing will not take the first move on the Taiwan issue. We also believe that Washington understands that when playing the "Taiwan card" to contain Beijing, ambiguity is more effective than clarity.
