### REAL TIME: HOW FAR IS CHINA WILLING TO GO TO “WIN” THE TRADE WAR?

21 April 2025|Economic Development, Geopolitics, Realtime, Trade, Trump administration
On April 2, 2025, U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order to announce the imposition of "reciprocal tariffs". We have written and spoken about these issueshere,here,here,here, andhere. Trade partners of the U.S. were initially subjected to Trump tariffs ranging from 10% to 49%, with China facing a tariff rate of 34%. Before the opening of the U.S. stock market on April 4, 2025, China hit back with a flurry of countermeasures, including imposing a 34% tariff on imports of all U.S. products starting April 10. Today, this tariff/trade war has escalated to Chinese tariffs on the US of 125% and U.S. tariffs on China of 145%. This OGL Real Time focuses on the reactions of Chinese citizens and the Chinese government to the trade war.
There is a lot of speculation on who will “blink” first, President Trump and the United States or Chairman Xi and China. It goes without saying that both economies are going to suffer from the standoff. However, China posted Q1 numbers that exceeded its 2025 GDP growth goals (5.4% versus 5%). How is China managing the trade war standoff from an economic standpoint?
China's response involves three levels: the central government, local governments, and enterprises：
In contrast to Trump's unilateralism, Beijing has adopted a strategy of "countermeasures + multilateral cooperation": imposing tariffs on U.S. agricultural products, controlling rare earth exports, and restarting economic dialogues with the EU, Japan, and South Korea while optimizing supply chains under the Belt and Road Initiative. Simultaneously, the Commerce Ministry has warned it will retaliate against any country that curries favor with the U.S. at China's expense. In macroeconomic policy, Beijing may further stimulate the real estate market and boost stock markets to expand domestic demand and stabilize expectations in the short term. Should Beijing adopt unexpected economic stimulus measures, such as reducing medical and pension insurance contribution rates, it could achieve immediate positive results.Local governments may subsidize affected businesses by reducing trade exhibition fees, issuing employment stabilization subsidies, and helping enterprises switch to domestic sales channels. However, since local authorities face fiscal constraints, these measures hold mainly symbolic value for businesses reliant on U.S. operations.In 2024, U.S.-bound exports accounted for 14.7% of China's total exports, with Zhejiang Province at 16.2% and Ningbo City, within Zhejiang, reaching 18.5%—figures that provide insight into Chinese enterprises' actual exposure to the U.S. market. Based on our discussions with Ningbo exporters, most report U.S. business comprising under 30% of their operations. While painful, they generally remain capable of weathering the challenges. Zhejiang's 2025 Q1 GDP grew by 6%, and Ningbo's by 5.6%, both above the national average. Manufacturers and their American clients are waiting to see if Trump's tariffs will become long-term policy.

Given the strong personalities involved, particularly that of Chairman Xi, who is known for his pride and firm leadership style, how is his handling of the current situation being perceived within China?
The Chinese government's response to the trade war has gained broad public support, including from critics. Netizens view China's countermeasures as measured and proportionate, strengthening its image as a responsible global power and enhancing its international standing and influence. The public particularly supports top leader's visits to Vietnam, Malaysia, and Cambodia, seen as strategic moves to coordinate responses to Trump's tariffs. Social media mocks foreign governments reportedly willing to make concessions for U.S. tariff removals.
One trade war issue is how much hardship each nation's citizens are willing to endure. Chinese households, with a much higher savings rate than Americans (34.3% vs. 4.6%), may be better positioned to weather economic strain. Culturally, the concept of “eating bitter” (吃苦)—accepting hardship as a part of life—also plays a role. How are Chinese citizens embracing this moment?
Chinese netizens widely resent Trump's tariff tactics, seen as extortion and not a genuine Art of the Deal. Many citizens are willing to endure personal losses while supporting government countermeasures, recognizing the necessity of the struggle: refusing to perpetually endure historical patterns of hardship or “eating bitter”, and a determination to pursue better livelihoods. The most acute impacts will likely hit the middle-class employed by U.S.-invested firms or in China-U.S. trade, especially those with mortgages, who face higher risks of job loss and difficulty finding comparable pay. In contrast, lower-tier workers generally find it easier to secure similar-paying jobs.
In contrast, most Americans, even some in Trump's inner circle, are seen confused about the true objectives of his tariff policy. If the goal is to contain China, why target allies like Canada, Japan, and South Korea? If the aim is to reshore manufacturing, collaborating with China to encourage its industrialists to build production facilities in the U.S. would be more effective than tariffs.
Naturally, the trade war poses challenges for China's economy, which has a sophisticated manufacturing supply chain. But while the U.S., following President Trump’s logic, would need to build a domestic supply chain from the ground up, China already has one in place. The challenge for China now is to pivot, forming new partnerships with alternative “customers” or national allies. So how is China handling this aspect of the trade war?
Beijing's countermeasures against Trump's tariffs are driven by confidence in China's strong industrial ecosystems. For example, Shanghai's municipal data reveals that 20,000 of the city's foreign trade enterprises maintain U.S. trade relationships, with 85% of exports are intermediate and industrial goods, versus 10% for consumer products. A Shanghai-based equipment supplier for Meta's AI centers defiantly declared "not budging a single cent" on pricing: "These orders aren't favors from the U.S.—their factories can't deliver, so they're forced to beg us to make replacements. Our production cycle including shipping is four months. The plant in America, fifty-two weeks… Let Meta try slowing down, they'll get leapfrogged overnight…Our losses sting, but their survival's on the line." Most firms are currently focusing on liquidity management and maintaining healthy cash reserves. While the three-month outlook remains unpredictable, the medium-to-long-term trend clearly indicates more Chinese enterprises are going global.
