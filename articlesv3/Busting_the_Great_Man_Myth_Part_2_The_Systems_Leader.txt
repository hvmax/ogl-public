### Busting the Great Man Myth – Part 2: The Systems Leader

20 April 2023|Systems Leadership
This is the third entry in a multi-partOn Global Leadershipseries on Systems Leadership. Theprevious postbegan an examination of the “Great Man Myth” that persists in both contemporary research and popular understanding of leaders.Central to that piece was the contrast between a conventional focus on individual figures and a more robust understanding of the reality of collective leadership that encompasses interactions with situational variables and relationships with other persons. This post extends the critical discussion of the “Great Man Myth” and formulates an alternative view of collective and everyday leadership, “The Systems Leader.”  -- The Editorial Team
By Sara Beckman and David Slocum
In our lastpost, we unpacked the widely held Great Man Myth of leadership. The legacy of Great Man thinking and our layered preferences for individual and ultimately heroic narratives have deep psychological and cultural roots. While the simplicity of charismatic, decisive, larger-than-life – and predominantly male – leaders is reassuring in its familiarity, that preference is protean and varies in different historical situations. Writing of his and Nitin Nohria’s expansive historical studies of twentieth-century management at the Harvard Business School, Anthony Mayo noted in 2006 how the opportunity for great business leadership “emerges when environmental factors and individual action come together.” Great business success, he argues, arises from leadership that appreciates this multiplicity of factors and uses that understanding “to seize the Zeitgeist.”
While contrasting individual Great Man leaders with collective leadership, we highlighted the interdependence of aLeadership Systemof relationships, interactions, and symbolsandaContextual Systemof salient situational variables and other persons and their interactions with those leaders (Figure 1). Mayo and Nohria emphasize that successful leaders possesscontextual intelligence, an “awareness of and ability to adapt to the context.” We go further and argue that leaders not only adapt to their contexts but can also actively make sense of, (re)frame, and act upon those contexts themselves. Furthermore, we suggest, many leaders are also acutely aware of the broader environmental system in which they operate, and regularly redraw the boundaries of that system. In other words, we suggest, they areSystems Leaders.
Longtime management thinker Warren Bennis (with Robert Thomas, 2002) labeledthe ability of leaders “to change their style and approach to fit the culture, context, or condition of an organization”theiradaptive capacity. Taking a systems view, and underscoring the interdependence ofLeadershipandContextual Systems, our claim is that many leaders also have a corresponding ability to change their cultures, contexts, conditions, or indeed the environment in which they operate – adisruptive capacity. This latter capacity can be exercised in various ways. Some leaders create new markets or disrupt existing ones with innovative technologies or products. Others reinvent business or operational models or processes. Still others upend conventional team or organizational norms by transforming cultures, implementing teaming practices, or prioritizing equity and inclusion. In short, some disrupt theContextual Systemwhile others go beyond to affect a broaderEnvironmental System(Figure 2).
The major elements in this three-systems view of leadership require more elaboration. In particular, we unpack the central terms and concepts ofsituation,context, andenvironment. Each has a complicated and often inconsistent history of definition and usage in management research and practice. Yet clarifying these terms allows us to reconcile them and produce a more coordinated approach to the complex conditions that leaders must regularly make sense of and take action in. The outcome will be a systems-based view of more collective leadership that nevertheless recognizes how every individual can contribute and become a successfulSystems Leaderover time.
Althoughsituational leadershiphas become a commonplace expression to describe the general adaptability of leaders to different conditions, the meaning of the central term ‘situation’ has varied greatly. Sociologist Albert Murray (1941) described social situations simply as providing ‘needs’ that call leadership processes to action. Psychologist Fred Fiedler’s influential earlycontingency theory of leadership(1978) studied eight different situational types built around different combinations of leader-follower relations, task structure, and leader position/formal authority.
More familiarly to many, and across several model iterations, behavioral scientist and entrepreneur Paul Hersey and consultant Ken Blanchard (1985,2012) prioritized the maturity (meaning competence and commitment) of those being led as the basis for four different and adaptive leadership styles.Daniel Goleman (2000)used six drivers of organizational ‘climate,’ or working environment (flexibility, responsibility, standards, rewards, clarity, commitment), as the bases for deploying the most impactful of six leadership styles. Business scholars Victor H. Vroom and Arthur G. Jago (1988,2007) developed a decision-making and participation management model contingent on situations understood through a series of seven questions that focused on the problem faced, the importance of addressing it to organizational goals, and the value of team collaboration on the problem.
A key shortcoming of most of these models, asClaude L. Graeff (1983)points out, is their reliance on varied and limited sets of considerations to prescribe how leaders should respond to the complex and shifting conditions surrounding them. As in actual decision-making, the models seek to make sense of those dynamic and uncertain conditions, distilling them into a manageable set of factors. Those key factors then become the bases for developing a corresponding group of leadership styles. Vroom and Jago’s question-driven approach is the most open of these approaches, though it ultimately also functions to determine how consultative a leader should be based on a limited set of factors.
For our purposes, a "situation" itself as a category for capturing multiple factors and conditions seems less helpful than relying on what have been called the ‘situational variables’ that exist in given times and places. Situational variables include many of the individual elements -- for example, task structure, character of followers, shared working environment, and the specific problem faced -- articulated inSituational Leadership modelswithout having to contain them in pre-set or -prioritized categories.
"Situational variables" also figure importantly in thoughtful discussions ofcontext. Canadian researcher Gary Johns has been among the most thorough analysts of the concept in the field of management. Among the significant threads he examines is that ofsalientsituational variables, that is, those factors or players needed for the core activities of a business. While necessary, salient variables have different strengths (e.g., high-quality training opportunities may not translate into improved performance), often require bundling together (combining several business models to leverage different products), and sometimes contrast each other (committed internal diversity-inclusion-equity culture that pushes against external norms of inequality and division). Ultimately, Johns offers a pragmatic definition of context as “situational opportunities and constraints that affect the occurrence and meaning of organizational behavior as well as functional relationships between variables” (2006: 387). This helpful summation accords with the historical studies of context and “Zeitgeist Leadership” by Mayo and Nohria (2005) and also sits centrally in the broader review of research literature on leadership context by Australian researcher BurakOc (2018).
Our emphasis here is on contextualsystems. Rather than identifying or prioritizing specific contexts (for instance, a particular market or industry, a set of cultural attitudes or legal regulations, specific management principles and practices), aContextual Systemhighlights the interdependence of the multiple contexts bearing on leadership at given times. Moreover, it is crucial to recognize that contexts exceed the bounds of a project, team, or organization. Markets, economic conditions, social and cultural norms, and customer habits and expectations are examples of the external variables and conditions that combine with more internal elements, like the experience, commitment, and capabilities of other persons and such resources as process expertise, knowledge transfer, and technological and financial assets. Together, these variables and resources constituteContextual Systemsthat, with prioritization and enablement by leadership, generate activities and results.
Among the three concepts, the environment is least well-elaborated in management research. This is perhaps understandable considering the scale of variables at this level. As illustration, take a familiar approach to analyzing macro environmental conditions: the PESTEL framework examines Political, Economic, Socio-cultural, Technological, Environment and Legal factors. With its origins in a 1967 book,Scanning the Business Environment, by Harvard Business School strategic planning professor Francis J. Aguilar, the general value of expanding one’s knowledge of the substance and relevance of external environments has long been recognized. Yet defining the criteria for each category, applying those rigorously, and then formulating the interactions and hierarchy among them for a specific project or company have proven elusive (Yuksel 2012). Moreover, if part of our aim here is to differentiatecontextualandenvironmentalfactors, a further complication would be to determine which factors -- say, a macroeconomic trend, a technological innovation, or a new regulation -- fits in which system and why.
A potentially helpful approach to understanding leadership environments and theEnvironmental Systemas different from theContextual System, may derive from activity theory andhuman-computer interaction research. There, the distinction is often a matter of breadth. AnEnvironmental Systemcomprises a universal set of events, variables, and possibilities for activity, including involving the user. It is the universe of what we could know and contains perfect and complete information about given activities or pursuits. Determining which variables or relationships in this universal set are relevant is fundamental to learning. It is also a process akin to the major and ongoing challenge for leadership to determine the salience of information and the relevance of given variables for them and their team, project, or organization.
An extreme view of this process is that a leader's challenge is like trying to find meaningful books in a Borgesian library: leadership must determine which among the infinite possibilities of theEnvironmental Systemare worth pursuing and making part of a team’s or organization’s everyday work, theirContextual System. Yet more pragmatically, as learners, leaders must perform two related functions: first, they must regularly navigate ‘wicked learning environments’ (to use psychologist Robin Hogarth’s phrase) marked by complexity, uncertainty, and stochastic processes; and second, in doing so, they must determine which variables are salient to their work and incorporate them as priorities in theContextual System. The leader’s very process of learning re-draws the boundaries between the two systems by re-defining which variables are relevant at a given time.
In other words, while clarifying these concepts and their interrelationship is important, it is also necessary to connect them to leadership. That is, rather than assuming a context or environment remains separate from an individual leader who must, with a team, then respond or adapt to it, the proposal here is that aSystems Leaderdefines and maps the dynamic boundaries of contexts and environment. One way that leadership accomplishes this is familiar: by identifying opportunities in a marketplace or community and then aligning people and resources to create and capture value. Those opportunities may be familiar and even well-known, like tweaking an existing product or refining an established business model, in which case most of the activity occurs in re-organizing or increasing the efficiency of largely known information or other variables in the contextual system.
Take, for example, Kimberly Malek who, along with her cousin Tyler, founded ice cream companySalt & Straw, offering “handmade and curiously delicious ice cream”. Unwilling to sacrifice the fundamental principles on which they built the company -- make unbelievable ice cream, build connection, provide unforgettable hospitality, be a good neighbor, and keep it local -- they disrupted widely held beliefs about how mass market products should be manufactured and distributed. Salt & Straw works closely with local makers, farmers, and chefs to create unique flavors that leverage local ingredients and offer at least 36 flavors across their 21 locations. They change their flavors every four weeks and make all this happen with a highly flexible manufacturing process that is the envy of “lean manufacturing” advocates.As Malek describes, "We make our ice cream five gallons at a time and we hand pack every single pipe — in fact, if you turn it over, they sign the bottom and you can see who put each brownie and handmade caramel in."
While disrupting beliefs about how mass market food products are produced and delivered (theEnvironmental System), Malek leaned heavily on what she learned from Howard Schultz in her years working for Starbucks about developing a business model based on people first. The Salt & StrawContextual Systemisgrounded deeply in relationships with and among employees and the local communities(or neighborhoods) in which Salt & Straw operates, propagated in part by Salt & Straw University. Collaboration with the local community is at the heart of both theice cream flavor design and creationprocess and of the delivery of the ice cream tasting and consumption experience. Happily, despite the significant challenges posed by the Coronavirus epidemic, the strength of the Malek’s adaptive capacity has allowed Salt & Straw to reorient core elements of theirContextual Systemto provide more online ordering and pickup along with adapted in-store experience.
Another type of leadership is perhaps even better-known and celebrated: this is leadership that envisions new products or services, disrupts or even creates markets, and inspires others to create new forms of value. In the terms used here, this far-reaching work involves seeing potential patterns or possibilities amongst the infinite variables of anEnvironmental Systemand, through original thinking, analysis, and hard work, making them part of a more widely-knownContextual System. This is the leadership of entrepreneurs who create new niches or full-blown markets. As such, these leaders re-draw the boundaries betweenContextual and Environmental Systemsby expanding the broader organizational, market or societal understanding of possible connections and creations.
The well-known story of the founding of Airbnb by co-founders Brian Chesky and Joe Gebbia, who started by renting space in their apartment to conference attendees in an overbooked San Francisco hotel room market, shows the disruptive capacity of its founders insignificantly alteringa hugeEnvironmental System. Nearly overnight, however, with the arrival of the Coronavirus crisis, Airbnb’s business was virtually shut down. In a public and strikingly empathicletter to employees, Chesky announced the layoff of 25% of Airbnb’s employees. With clarity around the challenges the company faced -- “we don’t know exactly when travel will return” and “when travel does return, it will look different” -- as well as around the strategic choices the company was making he, along with his co-founders and board, significantly restructured Airbnb’sContextual System, narrowing focus on its original core business.
They then kept a close eye on the market, discovering that instead of flying to distant destinations, urban residents increasingly sought to rent entire homes in neighboring towns and cities, allowing them to avoid the shared spaces involved in hotel stays. Airbnb shifted the focus of their website to offer local options, and by early July guests were booking stays at the rate they were before the pandemic hit. Chesky and his team looked beyond conventional ways of planning and operating within theirContextual Systemand were willing to respond to previously unforeseen scenarios offered by new possibilities in theEnvironmental System. With the pivot from large-city vacation travel to offering interesting accommodations closer to home, they are expected to enter intoan initial public offering, perhaps by the end of 2020.
Although the origin stories of Salt & Straw and Airbnb differ, both leadership teams ultimately created businesses that significantly disrupted theEnvironmental Systemsin which they operate. Both married that disruptive capacity with adaptive capacity to create and morph theirContextual Systemsover time, most remarkably in response to the 2020 pandemic.
The challenge of differentiatingContextual and Environmental Systemsshows why systems thinking and leadership can be difficult. It entails multiple, shifting, and interdependent variables, drawn from complex and uncertain environments, requiring regular observation, analysis, and decision-making about priorities and action-taking. ASystems Leadermust in this way be a continuous systemlearner, resolving what social scientists refer to as a level-of-analysis problem and what organizational behavior experts call a ‘boundary problem.’ Nobel Laureate Herbert Simon’s concept ofbounded rationality, initially articulated more than six decades ago, underscores the benefit of acknowledging the constancy with which we all, as decision-makers, must cope with inevitably incomplete and inconsistent information.
To conclude, it is necessary to recognize that such ongoing systems thinking, learning, analysis, and decision-making are not abstract undertakings; rather, they are realized in everyday leadership decisions and actions. The work of theSystems Leaderstill fundamentally entails setting a goal or vision, determining which paths offer the best possibility of reaching them, aligning resources accordingly, and interacting with other persons in ways that move the team or organization toward those ends. However, when leading systems, those analyses and decisions encompass complex and dynamic systems marked by situational variables, changing contexts, and environments of nearly endless possibilities. While motivating colleagues, gathering resources, and prioritizing tasks, theSystems Leaderdefines salience, sets boundaries, navigates dynamism, and coordinates the interdependence of the systems.
Next we will tackle Sensemaking as one of the important capabilities Systems Leaders must cultivate.
