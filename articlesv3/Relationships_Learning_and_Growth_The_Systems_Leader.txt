### Relationships, Learning, and Growth: The Systems Leader

5 May 2023|Leadership, Systems Leadership
This is the sixth entry in a multi-partOn Global Leadershipseries on Systems Leadership. Theprevious postexplored 'Selfmaking' as an essential activity enabling the Systems Leader to develop and practice new understandings of themselves and co-evolve with dynamic situations and complex environments. Extending Ronald Heifetz's metaphor of leadership comprising activities on the dance floor and the balcony. While leaders on the dance floor intervene in activities and engage others, their direct observations of and relationships with others form an ever-changing web of interaction. Likewise from the balcony, leaders gain perspective on the relevance of work and the nature of relationships that amalgamates others’ perceptions of them. In this piece, Sara Beckman and David Slocum examine how emotional intelligence, mindsets, learning, and growth shape those human relationships and enable the Systems Leader to successfully guide project, team, and organizational work.
By Sara Beckman and David Slocum
In this series, we have been building a model of leadership based in Systems Thinking, Doing, and Learning (Figure 1). The model itself comprises three interdependent systems: of leadership, relevant contexts, and the wider, often unknown or little understood environment. To develop the model, we have thus far largely focused on unpacking those key elements themselves: the leader and Leader-Symbol, salient situation variables, and contexts and environments. However, to understand this practice of leadership more deeply, it is also crucial to explore the interdependencies among these elements and systems. Doing so sheds light on the dynamism of Systems Leadership and the ongoing learning and adaptation driving it.
People and their relationships are always vital to systems. Determining how people can best interact with process models or innovation frameworks in given situations is fundamental to the Systems Leader’s work. The interdependence of structural and human elements can vary over time and according to circumstances, and it is up to the leader to define and guide those variations. A practical way to think about this is to recognize how different businesses can be successful in the same marketplace despite having distinct cultures -- Uber and Lyft, Intel and AMD, Target and Walmart -- marked by sub-groups of people who interact and respond to change very differently. It is the leaders’ responsibility to draw out similarities and coherences across different people and attitudes toward chance and to move the overall business forward. Part of this effort, as argued previously in this series, recognizes that people themselves evolve as projects or teamwork progress and organizations change. The capacity of team members or company workers for selfmaking, like that of their leaders, becomes central to sensemaking and sustainable experimentation and implementation of collective change.
What are the core principles and behaviors of Systems Leaders who empower others and build relationships that support ongoing and iterative sensemaking and the activities that ensue? We will examine more closely in a subsequent article the processes of experimentation and implementation -- speaking plainly, the active ‘doing’ that pursues solutions or other opportunities -- which complement and follow from sensemaking. Here, suffice to say that those activities involve some different aspects of human engagement and relationships than the more abstract observation and re-framing that generates insights and ideas. Yet the leadership skills required for these different kinds of shared work often vary in their emphasis rather than their nature. This variability parallels the research on innovation that shows how differing levels of facilitative or directive management can have differing impacts across the stages of the innovation process (e.g., identifying a new product idea, determining an improved process for production, or re-positioning an offering in the market).
With that noted, we highlight three core sets of principles and behaviors that orient Systems Leaders throughout their work with other persons and then describe, for each, a few key priorities that can be particularly important in building and guiding relationships during both framing and re-framing and the more active work of execution and implementation.
I. Emotional Intelligence (EQ)
A foundational capability for leading others is Emotional Intelligence (EQ) -- that is, the perceiving, understanding, managing, and using emotions of self and others. While the term had been used by psychologists since the mid-1960s, it was popularized with the appearance of science journalist Daniel Goleman’s book,Emotional Intelligence, in 1995 and his still perennially popularHarvard Business Reviewarticle, “What Makes A Leader?” three years later. Focusing on the five components ofself-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, empathy,andsocial skill, Goleman argued that not only did successful leaders possess and practice these abilities, but in doing so they produced positive business results.
Crucially, Goleman’s approach to effective management yokes together a leader’s emotions (self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation) with those of other persons (empathy, social skill). In other words, by embracing EQ, leaders acknowledge the central role played by emotions in the human relationships that constitute teams and organizations. Team members can correspondingly bring their emotions to work, meaning that they can more fully engage with others and the tasks they share.
More recently, psychologist Lisa Feldman Barrett has explained howemotions are both a social and cultural construction that emerge from our relationships with others and from the cultures around us. Again, the leader can identify opportunities for their own and others’ growth and prioritize the allocation of resources to enable that development. Among Feldman Barrett’s insights is the differing “emotional granularity,” or ability to identify and name emotions with specificity, that exists in different cultures and among different people. Such granularity is important in that it can help to shape one’s “emotional vocabulary” and “literacy” and, in the process, a person’s ability to relate to others’ emotions in conversation and interactions. The better leaders are able to communicate their own emotions and to understand those of others, the more likely they will be able to create environments that are supportive of a full commitment to the personal growth and engagement of their team members.
Part of creating space for engagement of emotions in the workplace is creating ‘Psychological safety’ which first emerged in research by Harvard Business School’s Amy Edmondson in the late 1990s. The concept rose to prominence in 2015, when amulti-year Google studyconcluded that psychological safety “was far and away the most important of the five dynamics” they found driving its own successful teams. (The other four were dependability, structure & clarity, meaning of work and impact of work.) Though not only about emotions, they summarized the psychological safety concept as, “Team members feeling safe to take risks and be vulnerable in front of each other.”
As such, psychological safety sits at the heart of leaders’ humility and self-management of emotions and their openness to and empathy with others. Edmondson has continued to developthe leadership behavioral tools that can foster psychological safety in teams and organizationsincluding creating shared expectations and meanings, building confidence that all voices are welcome, and orienting the group toward continuous learning. These priorities speak directly to the selfmaking of leaders and team members alike and to the openness and learning required of sensemaking as well as in subsequent activities of experimentation and implementing.
II. Navigating Mindsets
Even as it has become a more fashionable term for both researchers and popular commentators, there is no consensus definition formindset. Generally speaking, the term refers to our individual mental models, ways of seeing and making meaning in the world, or a set of beliefs and assumptions we hold about ourselves, our organizations, and the world we engage. In research and writing over three decades, psychologist Robert Kegan (notably with collaborator Lisa Laskow Lahey) has proposeda model of five distinct stages of adult development characterized by differing mindsets.
Transitioning among the stages entails individuals moving from self-serving and transactional behaviors to relationship-based and rule-following behaviors and thoughts to more reflective, self-defining, and finally interconnected minds. The evolution foregrounds the crucial toggle between enabling individual identities and independenceandmaintaining the group-based authority and coordination that leaders must orchestrate to move teams or organizations forward together.  Importantly, Kegan and Lahey’s model also provides a basis for understanding the individual development of leaders and others who improve their practice of emotional intelligence.
Probably the best-known approach to mindsets is that of Stanford psychologist Carol Dweck, who summarized decades of child educational research in the 2006 book,Mindset. Her central insight is a contrast between those with afixed mindsetwho believe their basic abilities, intelligence, and talents are fixed, and those with agrowth mindsetwho believe that their abilities and talents can be developed through effort, learning, and persistence. While her model does not map entirely onto Kegan’s, there are several similarities germane to understanding the Systems Leader.
One is the practice ofreflection, of knowing when and how to step to the balcony to (re-)consider one’s actions, relationships, and thinking. Another is the common embrace of the multiple, interdependent dimensions of growth in individuals driven by experimentation and learning. Correcting a common mis-reading of her work, “the false growth mindset” -- which arises primarily from leaders focusing on “process-praise,” not outcomes, to better motivate others -- she says: “Praise the effort that led to the outcome or learning progress; tie the praise to it. It’s not just effort, but strategy … so support the student in finding another strategy.”
A former collaborator of Kegan’s, Jennifer Garvey Berger, has written cogently about the interconnections amongforms of mind(her term for mindsets, which she derives from Kegan and Lahey’s model), individual growth and development, and leadership. In team and organizational settings, in particular, she observes how distinct mindsets engage authority and truth differently.Leaders with different mindsetshave different relationships to sensemaking -- for example, whereas some engage in re-framing or meaning-making that adheres to existing rules and standards of expertise, others are better able to arbitrate between those external standards or ‘voices’ and their own internal values and beliefs.
That realization also has direct implications for all kinds of activities and work done with teams. In fact, the complications brought by distinct leadership mindsets multiply when recognizing that individual team members likewise have different forms of mind, and therefore enact sensemaking or other actions -- and their relationships with other team members and the leader -- differently. When working to form coherent teams with a shared focus, leaders consequently need to acknowledge mindset differences and adapt to the varied ways that individual team members manage conflicts, process feedback, experiment, learn, and grow.
III. Systems Thinking
Starting withThe Fifth Discipline(1990), MIT systems scientist Peter Senge spearheaded the application to management and organizations of another foundational (if definitional) capability for Systems Leaders: systems thinking. In particular, he focused onlearning organizationscharacterized by a commitment to both the active learning and growth of their individual members and their collective development and transformation. The five disciplines underpinning learning organizations are: building ashared visionthat enables team energy and focus, surfacing and improvingmental models(and leaving behind unwanted ones), fostering dialogue to facilitateteam learning, nurturing individual commitment to learning andpersonal mastery, andsystems thinking,the “fifth discipline” that integrates the other four and emphasizes the interdependence of people and processes.
Trust is essential to this interdependence and the substantive and sustained interactions among team members or company co-workers. Recent models have sought to expand understanding of how trust shapes interactions and, in turn, the ongoing learning and development they enable. Social age management analyst Julian Stodd’s “landscape of trust” research explores how trust -- which he defines as “consistency and fairness” of response and “of action over time” -- is “earned, fractured or broken.”  He challenges leadersto explore the many dimensions of  trust within “their own system,”that is, the trust that concurrently sits between them and other individuals, within communities, and in an organization. Especially important for Stodd in his work on social leadership are communities, since they are theinformal systems (in contrast with formal structures like hierarchies) in which trust binds people together.
In a popularTED Talk about trust, Frances Frei, of the Harvard Business School, similarly argues that empathy is critical for building (rebuilding) trust, as are logic and authenticity. The three legs of the triangle of trust, in other words, represent different if interdependent dimensions of the relationships between people and their interactions with other entities like teams and organizations. As Frei (and co-author Anne Morriss) subsequently argue inUnleashed(2020), trust drives the leadership work of empowering diverse teams and, as benefits sensemaking and other shared actions, too, ensuring that everyone can contribute their unique capacities and perspectives. The final chapter ofUnleasheddiscusses culture, what Frei and Morriss view as the other major lever, besides strategy, for leading organizations. For them, culture comprises the rules of engagement for relationships and the collective agreement about what matters and what is true.
The shared behaviors, assumptions, and rules of engagement that constitute organizational culture are necessary for sensemaking, of course, but they are especially important as complements to formal structures of experimentation and implementation like innovation or operational processes. Author and advisor Daniel Coyle has unpacked more fullythe multiple and related dynamics of culture, examining many of the principles and interactions we have discussed here. These include building safety (designing and building for belonging), sharing vulnerability (his “vulnerability loop” rests in “a shared exchange of openness ... the most basic building block of cooperation and trust”), and the establishment of common purpose (which combines the development and practice of proficiencyandcreativity).
Emotional Intelligence, Navigating Mindsets, and Systems Thinking are each complicated topics for leaders to engage. Together, their interconnections highlight the dynamism and complexity of robust Systems Leadership. Yet these three broad sets of principles and behaviors demonstrate how leaders and others must embrace the same ongoing commitment to the learning and development of people as they do when taking action to drive innovation and make solutions. Like the inherent challenges of ongoing re-framing and experimentation to leading innovation, there is a fundamental paradox to leading others to learn in groups. Systems Leaders must cultivate psychological safety and foster growth and learning, help others to understand each other, and recognize that everyone is a sensemaker. At the same time, leaders have to ensure that everyone gets along, can perform together and contribute to productive interactions and learning, and finally move toward particular shared outcomes.
As a brief example, consider Cynthia Young, the former Head of Audience at theToronto Globe & Mailwho helped to shepherd the paper’s transition from print to digital between 2016-2018. Charged with creating andleading an audience experience teamto support applications of some of theGlobe & Mail’s investments in digital technologies, she gathered a group not of journalists but of young user experience, design thinking, and social media analysts and researchers. Belonging to neither side of the traditional divide (between editorial and business) in newspaper companies, the team adopted a more interdependent and systemic view of the paper’s operations and its changing readers.
That approach to theGlobe & Mail’s complex and changing situation required Young to engage in constant shifting of priorities, and empathetic management of team members’ emotions, as they identified and explored different, potentially relevant aspects of audience needs and expectations and how the paper was (or wasn’t) engaging them. Young also managed often disparate interactions with the paper’s senior leadership and journalists, supporting their transition from longstanding individual writing and editorial habits for print to accepting new routines aligned with the paper’s (and digital readers’) re-framing of how news could be better produced and delivered. In the end, Young's own growth paralleled that of her team charged with making sense of the paper’s audience and of the transformation of the paper itself.
In fact, the processes of selfmaking fostered by EQ, Systems Thinking, and Navigating Mindsets need to work in conjunction with effective experimentation and implementation. Kegan and his co-authors, from an interview about their 2016 book,An Everyone Culture, draw some of these parallels explicitly:
Scanning the literature on innovation over the last 10 years or so, one thing stands out for us: the core dynamic that drives sustained creativity and innovation has to do with a high capacity to challenge existing assumptions. That’s what the most consistently innovative people and organizations know how to do regarding their customers and markets, as well as their internal operations. They rigorously surface, test, and transcend limiting assumptions.That same ‘surfacing-and-testing’ dynamic, applied to ourselves, is what accelerates human developmentand lies at the heart of DDOs [Deliberately Developmental Organizations] (Slocum 2016).
Put differently, a leader’s recognition of, and active response to, the interdependencies in a system can propel a continual reinvention of processes, teams, and organizationsandenable the ongoing reinvention of themself and others.
In our next post, we will examine more closely the active experimentation and implementation of potential solutions (or pursuit of other opportunities) that both follows from and complements the more abstract framing and re-framing process. In doing so, we will introduce the concept of ‘solutionmaking’ that complements sensemaking and selfmaking in the work of the Systems Leader.
