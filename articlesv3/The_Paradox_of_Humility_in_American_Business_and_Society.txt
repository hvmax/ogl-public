### The Paradox of Humility in American Business and Society

Great business leaders are remarkably talented, possessing special skills that allow  them to push organizations to great heights. But true leadership  requires them to be both exceptional and humble. How can we teach the  next generation of America’s business leaders to be bold and exceptional  while still possessing the humility that allows them to be trusted and  believed?
The dictionary defines humility as "modesty" and "lacking in  pretense", but that doesn’t mean humble leaders are meek or timid. A  humble leader is secure enough to recognize his or her weaknesses and to  seek the input and talents of others. By being receptive to outside  ideas and assistance, creative leaders open up new avenues for the  organization and for their employees.
Strong leaders wear their humility lightly, and they rarely showcase  either their genius or their humility. Hence the paradox of humility:  How to share your best with the world while sublimating your ego to  advance the organization. Can you both stand out and sit back? The best  leaders prove that you can, and it’s a lesson that business students and  other novice business leaders should learn if they hope to achieve  success. As management expert Ken Blanchard says: “People with humility  do not think less of themselves; they just think about themselves less.”
American culture does not prepare us for this approach to leadership,  nor does academia. Humility has a deeply embedded place in religious  history (as a central tenet of most faith teaching), but it is rarely  referenced in American business teachings. And it is certainly not what  we teach in American business schools. On the contrary, we teach  students to be aggressive, distinguish themselves, stand apart.
That was the approach to leadership I brought to the deanship at the George Washington University School of Business three years ago. I believed that I was  suited for the job of dean, despite some glaring omissions in my  resume—I’d never served in a senior university administration position.  But I also had a reputation for designing innovative and profitable  programs and for being an authority on bold and creative leadership. My  status as a China expert helped, too, since every university is trying  to create a China strategy these days.
My GW tenure proved to be equal parts exhilarating and jarring—and,  most importantly, a true lesson in the importance of humility in  leadership. I loved the strategizing, but did a poor job bringing the  faculty along. With every homerun, there seemed to be a strikeout or  two. We launched a successful program here, and the faculty battled me  there. We raised more donations than ever, but spent more than we  budgeted. It was a roller coaster ride of failure and success.
Fortunately (or unfortunately), I have learned a great deal, both  from my struggles at GW during the last three years and my dismissal  from my deanship in late August. Studying, teaching, researching and  pontificating on leadership does nothing to prepare you for leadership;  and leadership requires so much more humility than I ever realized.
Regardless of the headlines, and there have been many, I realize  today that I was ultimately expelled for the most personal of reasons: I  was inexperienced and too impatient to suffer academic minutiae and  delicate egos. I might have had a vision for the school, but I also  needed more hands-on experience to complement my expertise. I did a  terrible job of managing up. I’ve taught leadership theory to executives  and MBA students for more than a decade, but the painful reality is  that I lacked the important element of humility when I walked through  the doors at GWSB. I thought I knew everything when I really had much to  learn.
In the end, what we teach about leadership in business schools simply  does not prepare students for leading, because we ignore the importance  of humility in business and beyond. As I lived through my own  challenges with leading, this reality became abundantly clear. It's a  message we must share with our students to better prepare them for a  life in business leadership.
