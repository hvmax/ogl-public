### Understanding China's Consumers and Thriving Consumption Market

6 November 2023|China, China Population, Chinese Culture
AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy and, in particular, life in China. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. We have written about economic development in China and China’s economic reforms, US-China relations, China’s changing role in the global political economy, and the history and current state of Chinese politics. In this post, we draw upon our research for our current book project, tentatively titled,Masters of Capitalism: Why Communist China Will Be the World’s Most Powerful Economy for Decades to Come.
Recent research by the McKinsey Global Institute asserts that China offers a $5 trillion consumption growth opportunity over the next decade (1). Yet, while China’s consumers and its vast consumption market are attractive, to many observers, the markets remain elusive. It is analogous to a night sky rich with stars. Chinese consumer markets are as crowded as the stars on a clear night, but once a company tries to reach them, they become as distant as the stars.
To explore the dilemma, we will dive into China’s consumers and consumption market, weaving between from boots-on-the-ground experiences on the micro-level and national macro-level data that track broad consumption trends. We hope to help readers deepen their understanding of how to open and win the Chinese market. While the grand scope of the market –size, numbers, demographics – is important to comprehend, so too are its culture, history, and local political economies.
Let us begin by diving into a couple of concrete examples that came about through research from the OGL team. A few years ago, when one of the OGL team members was advising Apple on its China operations, the company’s head of marketing raised a question: Apple is great at marketing and selling its products in tier 1 cities like Shanghai, Beijing, and Shenzhen. But, for the most part, we are not reaching the population outside of these urban centers. What are we missing? To answer this question, we took a research team down to Shehong County, a tier 5 city in China’s western province of Sichuan. There we studied the population and its practices, how it was interacting with technology, how it was consuming critical technology products, many of which were competitors to the vaunted Apple. (We have written about this research project with a profile of the Shehong basket makerhere.)
During our time in Shehong, we did not see a single Apple product. Stepping beyond this broad ethnographic observation, we drilled down following a family, the Ren family, in which the family’s Grandpa Tu labored daily at the making of two bamboo shoot baskets per day. While the family has long made its living selling these bamboo wares in a local Shehong shop, a few years ago the business catapulted into the ranks of RMB 3 million (about $420,000) annual income by selling these products online on Taobao, Alibaba’s online sales platform. We watched (and filmed) Grandpa Tu cutting bamboo shoots, stripping the shoots, kneeling on the floor weaving these shoots into large sturdy baskets (the size of large clothes baskets), quietly whispering to himself, “Strip by strip, weave the strips together, build a basket… Two baskets per day.” These baskets would then be picked up by Grandpa Tu’s grandson, Ren Zuguo, who would take the baskets to an online distribution center. There, the baskets would join a warehouse full of bamboo goods that would be registered on Alibaba’s Taobao platform, waiting to be shipped off to households across China. It was fascinating to observe the local supply chain of this production process. But again, no Apple products here. All of the mobile and computer technology we saw were Chinese brands – Huawei, Oppo, Vivo, Xiaomi, etc., and frequent references to Chinese platforms like Alibaba’s Taobao. We did see a few Samsung products, but Apple and other American brands were completely and conspicuously absent. Now some might assume this is protectionism, local favoritism of Chinese products and platforms. But we think there is more to it than this. We think it is also about consumers having an affinity for consuming products that are made by corporate giants thatseethem thatunderstandthem. As it turns out, knowledge of local customs, local culture, and local political economy matter. If you want to reach out and touch a few of those millions of stars that seem so far away, get out there and get close to them.
Another example came through a research project we conducted on the leadership of the founder of China’s sportswear company Maia Active. (We have written about this research project with a profile of Maia Active Co-Founder and CEO, Wang Jiayin,here.) The inspiration of Wang and her co-founder, Lisa Ou, was that foreign brands simply were notseeingthe Chinese consumer. As Wang explained in our interview with her, “For people like us, who want brands [that make] Asian-fitting activewear, where are they? Lululemon, Nike, Adidas, Western brans or like mega brands, they make their own products, and they don’t really fit Asians. So, we were thinking, why don’t we start something to do activewear but only for Asians. And that’s why we started Maia.” They described very basic things like using Asian bodies for designing and fitting mannequins. Wang explained, “So, first of all, we use Asian body-type data for our mannequins. And when we do the adjusting for sizes, we use the data pool for Asians. So, for example, if you are cutting from small to medium for Caucasians, it actually is going to be like 3 centimeters. But for Asians, it’s probably only 2.5. This type of difference makes our products fit Asians perfectly… [But] we’re not just talking about fitting, we are also talking about design, color, experience.” Amazing attention to detail. And the company has taken off. This is just another example of getting close, thinking about local details, helping the Chinese consumer feelseen. Recently, Maia Active was acquired by Anta Sport, a leading Chinese active wear corporation.
Now, stepping beyond these boot-on-the-ground approaches to understanding Chinese consumers, Let’s get back to the vast numbers reported in the aforementioned McKinsey Report.
Consumer Demographic
Sheer scale matters. After the reform and “opening up” since 1978, China’s economy has thrived, people's living standards have steadily improved, and China is now the second largest single consumer market in the world. The growing economy and rising incomes have turned into purchasing power and created generations of consumers. Although India just overtook the title of the most populous country in the world in April 2023, China still possesses the world's largest consumer group with spending power, thanks to her 734 million employed people, larger than that of that of India, or the US and EU combined. In the past decade, China's consumer demographic has experienced below major changes:
1.  The population structure is undergoing profound shift, total population peaked in 2021 and began to decline. In 2022, the median age of the population was 38.5 years, higher than 37.8 years in the United States; 65% of the population or 910 million people live in urban areas; and the size of the average household has been shrinking. The education level of major consumer groups, especially young consumers, has increased significantly (Figure 1, 2 and 3).
2.  China's consumer market has demonstrated resilience and dynamism despite the clouds of economic growth slowing down and geopolitical uncertainties. The consumer income and spending power are still increasing. Service consumption is growing faster than overall consumption (Figure 4)
3.  Considering per capita disposable income, the absolute gap between the rich and the poor is still significant, but the relative gap has narrowed. In 2022, the income of rural high-income households was slightly higher than that of urban middle-income households. Over the past decade, the income growth rate of western and central regions has been higher than the national average, while the northeast region has been lagging (Figure 5 and 6).
4.  As of June 2023, there are 1.079 billion Internet users in China, among them 99.7% are mobile Internet users. The Internet penetration rate is 76.4%. Browsing social media and watching videos are what netizens spend the most time on their mobile phones. The consumers are willing to try and embrace new digital technologies.
Since 2018, Beijing has frequently emphasized the country’s hyperscale market as a unique advantage of the Chinese economy, with one of the key arguments being that China has a middle-income group of more than 400 million (2). “Middle-income Group” is deliberately picked by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) to emphasize the economic attribute of the terminology, while sociologists prefer “Middle Class” to describe a social class with the assurance of living in a comfortable apartment and affording a rewarding lifestyle, thanks to good education, a stable job with career opportunities. The middle-income and affluent consumers (MAC) account for China’s top 30% families by income, but only top 15% families would fit the description of middle class described above.
On popular social media platforms like Weibo, Douyin, Zhihu, Xiaohongshu etc, topics on the consumptions of MAC in first- and second-tier cities have received lots of attention, most foreign brands also regard MAC as their main target customers. But there are companies that do the opposite, e.g., Pinduoduo, whose typical customers are in third- and fourth-tier cities and below. Such customer groups usually have lower income, are more price-sensitive, and pursue value for money. Catering for their needs, Pinduoduo provides acceptable quality goods at the lowest possible price. The rapid rise of Pinduoduo has shown that now forces are challenging e-commerce giants like Alibaba and JD.com, which focus more on bigger cities.
Consumption Needs
According to the latest economic data from NBS, China’s domestic consumption rebounds strongly and contributes 83.2% to economic growth in first nine months of 2023. Consumption expenditure data is an important economic indicator. In recent years, it is not uncommon to hear the news that consumption numbers came back lower than expected. But whenever the forecasts did not reflect what had happened, no one seemed to question the basis of forecasts, as if it was the disparity caused by the market, not by those economic specialists over exuberant misinformed outlook. We must not forget that consumption is foremost for consumers and statistical data are only a by-product. Let's put aside the macroeconomic narrative and examine what exactly Chinese consumers are spending money on.
Following Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, many people in China are still in the stage of satisfying deficiency needs that are concerned with basic survival. For example, according to the 2020 census, 11.6% of the 465 million households in the country do not have bathing facilities in residential premises, 14.8% do not use gas or electricity as cooking fuel, and 14.7% do not use toilets with feces treatment facilities. These households are largely among the low to middle-income group, many are in the rural area. They have a strong desire to improve their living conditions and are ready to spend if they have additional disposable income.
At the same time, middle-income and affluent consumers have gone beyond to growth needs. Out of the pandemic, middle-income consumers now care more about self-feeling and self-satisfaction. They seek experiences that are pleasing, at an expense that can be either big or small. Very often such individual experiences are closely connected with family members and friends.
During 2023 Mid-autumn Festival/National Day holiday (one of the two Golden Weeks), we saw overcrowded popular attractions across the country. The Golden Week is one of the rare opportunities for people who are not treated with paid annual leaves to go sightseeing with their families, although the experience is often less satisfying. At the same time, many urban white-collars avoided noisy popular attractions and enjoyed a laid-back break in near-by quieter areas. Such "reverse tourism" is becoming a new trend of urban tourism, because of its personalized quality, lower cost and rather spiritual pleasure.

Comparable to spending on tourism is the spend on health, people have become more health conscious：
Eat healthier - Consumers are turning to foods that are natural, nutritious and healthy.Exercise more - Sports and outdoor activities have become a part of people's daily schedules, more and more people spend their time in gyms, running and cycling, etc.Be proactive in self-health management - More family health monitoring tools, such as thermometers, body fat scales, blood pressure monitors have been equipped, family medical storage boxes are upgraded.

As the ownership has reached a fairly high level, most categories are unlikely to grow rapidly in quantity with a few exceptions like automobiles in rural areas.
After products or services are launched, it is important to hear customer feedback. In the past, the seller would be happy when a customer said, “it worth the money.” But now in China, this is not enough, what's missing here is “it worth the time”.
To many people especially those belong to MAC, time is as important as money, if not more. While money is direct and easy to measure, the value of time is often overlooked. Now consumers have become more sensitive to the time spent because their perceptions have changed. They value efficiency and are willing to trade money for time. Especially on services, people often care more about the time they spend. In new product promotion, some people don't accept free sample or free trial for a simple reason – “I don’t want to waste my time.”
Another important indicator of a good product or service is whether consumers are willing to recommend it to others. “Trust” is a prerequisite for deciding who can be the influencer, and consumers tend to trust the opinions of people with whom they have real-life relationships. This observation has been verified all over the world and especially in China, a society of acquaintances and trust.
What consumers will ultimately decide is determined by the equivalent value of a product or service. Chinese consumers are in a time of information explosion, and it is impossible not to react to negative news. As a result, consumers in general are returning to the traditional culture of living within their means. There are opinions that such shifts in consumer behavior have favored domestic brands, which are seen as more cost-effective and have a better understanding of Chinese consumer habits. In addition, many foreign brands – especially US brands – are worried about being affected by deteriorating relations between western countries and China. These views and concerns are legitimate but incomplete. In China, despite the geopolitical concerns, foreign brands can still do well understanding and attracting Chinese consumers. A few examples here, Disney, Starbucks, and Decathlon, among others. For any brand that has lost favor with consumers, the root cause of the failures always stems from the inadequacies of their product or service.
For foreign companies aiming to explore the Chinese market, the sheer scale of the markets and rising incomes remain key considerations. Companies need to bear in mind that it is a huge but complicated market with radical changes - socially, demographically, and technologically, the consumers are constantly being shaped accordingly. To succeed in capturing China’s vast consumer market, foreign companies need to understand culture and local political economy, stay on the top of the changes occurring therein, remain committed, be flexible and patient.
