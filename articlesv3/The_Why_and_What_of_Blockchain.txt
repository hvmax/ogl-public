### The Why and What of Blockchain

24 May 2021|China, Supply Chain
AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy and, in particular, life in China. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. We have sought to advance a conversation about the U.S.-China relationship, and a deep understanding of local economic development in China. We have been writing about the U.S.-China Trade War;innovation in the Chinese economy;entrepreneurship in China today; a series aboutChina’s Belt and Road Initiative, and the strategic strength oflocal economic development in China’s 2nd and 3rd tier cities. With our focus on China’s supply chain, we are also publishing a series of articles on the use of blockchain in the management and certification of China’s supply chain. This is the first in a series of articles on blockchain. – The Editorial Team

When President Xi Jinping announced in late 2019 that China was progressing the adoption of blockchain technology as a national priority, the goal was to facilitate domestic and international commerce through a trusted enterprise ecosystem.
An alliance of China’s State Information Center, China Mobile, China UnionPay and Red Date Technology supported the creation of the Blockchain Service Network (BSN). Already, BSN is on the path to being the largest and fastest-growing blockchain network in China, and possibly the world.
The move by Xi sent a message to technology companies and the world. Whenever Chinese leaders have promoted a specific technology, the results have been trailblazing. After leaders promoted artificial intelligence and 5G, companies responded and China is a leader today in those technologies.
The adoption of blockchain in China has been ground-breaking, vanquishing paper-intensive international trade, finance and logistics to the past and opening major routes for commerce along a new Digital Silk Road. The World Economic Forum forecasts that 10% of world GDP will be stored on blockchain by 2025.
To complicate the story, on May 22, Bitcoin, which is powered by blockchain technology, came under tighter regulation in China, as officials said it was necessary to “crack down on Bitcoin mining and trading behavior, and resolutely prevent the transmission of individual risks to the social field.” It’s unclear what the long-term impact of the regulation on blockchain in China.
On Global Leadership is beginning a series of articles with this primer on blockchain technology, mostly because we believe China will not only advance blockchain, it will likely lead the adoption globally for its use in manufacturing, agriculture and other sectors in the near and long term.
What is Blockchain?
Blockchain is a ledger of records (i.e., a database) that collects information about transactions that is stored digitally on a computerized network. In a nutshell, blockchain is distributed computing. It is a peer-to-peer data infrastructure – a distributed ledger operated by nodes that can be located anywhere. This distributed ledger can be made available for the public for easier searching and filtering for specific information without any central authority.
The key difference between a blockchain database and a traditional database is that in blockchain, a block carries a specific information for wider distribution. These blocks when filled with information are then chained together with previously filled blocks.
Once the data has been written on the block, it is next to impossible to erase or modify it. Trust between participating parties can be built without intermediaries such as banks, brokers, and other service providers. Each block is validated by the miners (working computer nodes) and only when consensus between the nodes is built, the block is registered and added to the blockchain.
Information stored in a blockchain is secured using cryptography and can only be accessed using keys and cryptographic signatures. Data are not owned by one single party, and the entire data infrastructure is visible to all parties. Every party can verify the records of its transaction partners directly, without an intermediary or distributed consensus mechanism.
The verification process, along with modern encryption methods, can effectively secure data on blockchain ledgers against unauthorized access or manipulation. Since existing blocks in the chain cannot be overwritten, users always have access to a comprehensive audit trail of activity (Miles, 2017). As such, the bigger the blockchain network, the more tamper-resistant the blockchain will be. The decentralized storage of data reduces the risk of single point of access failure associated with centralized databases.
Accessing Blockchain Data
Blockchains are typically defined as “permissioned” or “permissionless”. A permissionless blockchain is an open public blockchain where anyone can submit the transaction in the blockchain and read the transaction status. For example, Bitcoin and Ethereum are permissionless public blockchains where anyone can submit a transaction (buying/selling a crypto-asset) and query the blockchain. Within permissioned blockchains, participants need to obtain an invitation to join the network. Access can then be controlled by a consortium of members or by a single organization (private blockchain).
While a centralized ledger (private blockchain) could be hacked by a cyber criminal if he is successful in attacking the private network, a public blockchain ledger system is extremely hard to attack since hackers would have to manipulate most of the nodes in the blockchain.
Use Cases for Blockchain
Blockchain as a technology has the potential to disrupt many industries and sectors because of its innovative framework on how parties collaborate in flexible information exchange network. Some of the most prominent use cases where such technology can bring efficiency and increase productivity are:

How Blockchain can Address Supply Chain Challenges
Trust is the most influential factor driving interest in blockchain technology within supply chain management. The security and trust are critical in the overall success of any supply chain, and integrating the supply chain and blockchain will help alleviate the security and trust issues.
Key challenges in supply chain management today are:
· Coordinating process and digitizing information across multiple, distributed and often disconnected supply chain actors such as producers, brokers, transporters, processors, wholesalers, retailers, and consumerswho may not trust each other or a transaction.
· Onerous and costly data reconciliation processes due to large amount of data duplications and regularity requirements.
·Lack of product traceabilitydue to product information ambiguity, resulting from logging vague and uncertain product characteristics which are hard to trace. Within the supply chain there areseveral bottlenecks that make end-to-end traceability more challenging.
· Lack of connectivity, particularly with upstream suppliers due to incompatible and different types of IT systems thus causing delays for the next step of the chain.
· In general, there aresecurity and trust issuesin overall management of supply chain management (SCM).
Key Opportunities to Integrate Blockchain with Supply Chain
Key reasons for using blockchain solutions to alleviate supply chain complexity include:
· Since blockchain is a digital ledger of record, it would immediately remove the necessity for transferring physical paper wherever it is required in the supply chain.
· Transparency and audibility streamlines the process of sharing information, resulting in improved accountability and trust. In addition, it also shows near-real-time updates about a product.
· Blockchain facilitates data sharing without the need to change the systems and processes that each entity/participant has and thus allowing greater traceability of products across multiple partners, locations, and facilities.
· Through its inherent structure, blockchain can enable security and trust in the source of data coming from multiple data streams, thus ensuring that the data has not been altered.
· Blockchain can simplify and expedite contract management processes. This helps move the product more efficiently, especially when it involves the movement of a perishable product such as food and medicine. It also facilitates measuring the performance data because it can be readily collected by quering the blockchain.
· Perishable items moving through the supply chain face challenges from finance and insurance companies, especially the small businesses. Blockchain offers high level of certainty in where the data comes from, thus improving confidence of the lender who can offer an insurance to the small businesses a reasonable premium.
· Blockchain also creates opportunities and visibility for small businesses to access better prices and production control. It also helps suppliers to tweak their delivery plans and improve their efficiency.
· Blockchains have also resulted into reinvention of the new business models and sustainable product differentiation.
· Blockchains can help shorten the payment settlement amongst participating entities of the supply chain since all information about the products and services delivered can be accessed by participating members of the SCM network digitally and hence payment instructions to financial institutions can be sent without delays due to manual paper processing.
Blockchain technology supports streamlined operations and process automation. It can automatically enforce participant-agreed rules and process steps that can effectively facilitate, verify, and execute commerce. It also removes the necessity for counter-parties to conduct transactions without the need for a human intermediary.
