### Leadership Lessons from Coaching During the Pandemic

5 June 2020|Coronavirus, Leadership
David Slocum, PhD, is an executive coach whose clients include senior leaders and business owners in industries ranging from big tech, marketing and media to business intelligence and strategic consulting. During the coronavirus lockdown, David found that what defined his coaching has continued to be important as leaders throughout much of Europe and North America begin the slow process of defining their next normal. Here, David builds on a series of tweets he sent in late April as he observed the changes to his coaching practice, and offers insight and recommended reading about crisis leadership.
“Bad companies are destroyed by crisis, Good companies survive them, Great companies are improved by them.”~ Andy Grove (1994)
I’ve had the great privilege of being an executive coach for more than a decade. My recurring priorities with clients include grounding decisions and actions in their beliefs and values, committing to their and others’ growth across different areas of their lives, and supporting choices and habit changes they know should make but have great difficulty following through on. My clients are senior leaders and business owners, in industries ranging from big tech, marketing, and media to business intelligence and strategic consulting working in Western Europe and the United States. While the coronavirus crisis has impacted each differently, I’ve observed several commonalities in the challenges and opportunities many have been facing over the last three months.
Now, as leaders in much of Europe and North America emerge from coronavirus lockdown and begin the slow process of defining their next normal, I’ve paused to reflect on the coaching I’ve done since the pandemic overtook so many lives in early March. This is a continuation of the list of six observations about leadership from my coaching I set down in late April, after six weeks of lockdown in Europe. I’ve reproduced those here as I initially tweeted them, making only slight changes and adding links. What defined many of my interactions with clients at that time has continued to be important for them as the pandemic continued. Perhaps the most noticeable change has been their having to cope with the challenge of a persisting crisis: of sustaining high levels of energy, sleeping regularly and providing ongoing care for themselves and others, and avoiding being overwhelmed by continuing stress and uncertainty.
Following the list of twelve observations about leadership in crises and beyond is a survey about their pandemic experiences I’ve been sharing with clients and a list of a dozen leadership books I’ve recommended to them during the crisis.
1. Start from where you are. Determine how best to support all your people. Embrace theStockdale Paradox: Never confuse your confidence and resolve that you’ll prevail long-term with the discipline to confront honestly the facts and uncertainty of the current reality.
2. Acknowledge and adapt your life boundaries being blurred by the crisis – at work, at home, with family, with friends, for yourself, in digital spaces. Don’t double-down on what got you here; be open to making hard decisions and unexpected changes, and to learning with others.
3. Communicate clearly, transparently, consistently, and with care – but don’t overwhelm by over-communicating. Also, remember: individuals have different communication, coaching, and feedback needs so personalize whenever possible. For all, make sure you do what you say.
4. Focus on the human, practical, and concrete in your leadership decisions and actions. Execute your key priorities every day while keeping an eye on more distant time horizons. More than ever, model your values, vulnerability, integrity, and what you want to see from others.
5. Match the internal pace of teams or organizations with external conditions (asStanley McChrystalputs it), especially by adapting to new and evolving urgencies, the accelerated cadence of business, and the demands on you (and your teams) to sustain high levels of energy, emotion, and performance over time.
6. Be intentional about caring for others and caring for yourself. Sleep. Guard against information overload. Recognize that fears, anxieties, and uncertainties are both impacting people’s work performance and the rest of their lives and calling on us to lead more creatively, optimistically, supportively and empathetically.
7. Put in the time and energy to answer, honestly, the essential question, What do you really want? At work, in relationships, in life, for the world. Then determine, how will you achieve that? In crises, especially, also ask: What do you really need? Physically, emotionally, psychologically, economically.
8. Acknowledge you’re frequently more driven to avoid losing what you have than to pursue what you want.Loss aversionis real: we prefer familiar unhappiness to unfamiliar happiness. Fear of working with less status or money, of eating or sleeping alone, of displaying weaknesses or vulnerability can easily trump a desire for change. Be courageous.
9. Do everything you can, respectfully, to understand and respond to what others want and need, what they fear, how you can support the change(s) they seek in their lives. As a leader, colleague, confidante, loved one or friend, tell them and show them you care. Often. Help them become (what they strive for as) their best selves.
10. Expand and diversify the circles of friends, confidantes, and advisers who regularly surround and support you. Don’t always (over-)rely on the same few or one. Assess your support systems – and confront what they say about you and re-cast them to help you learn and grow. Remember: you’re the average of all the people who surround you (David Burkus)
11. Know and act on your core principles and values. These are your most crucial guides to leading (and living) during crises and uncertainty that defy conventional analysis or forecasting. Identify your values and beliefs, clarify how they orient you in given situations, and build your decisions, communications, and actions around them.
12. Determine how important this moment is for you, those you love or lead, your career or company, and the rest of your life. For some, it’s a time for radical reinvention. For others, it’s more about reinforcing current relationships or initiatives. For all, crises accelerate where you’ve been heading. Take time to understand what this crisis means for you and act accordingly (overcoming, as needed, #8).
“The Pandemic is a Portal” Survey
On April 3, author Arundhati Roy published a short essay in theFinancial Timesentitled, “The Pandemic is a Portal.” Citing past epidemics, she emphasized the opportunity the current Coronavirus crisis offered for positive social, economic and, finally, human change. Roy concludes her piece with the following words of choice and possibility:
"Historically, pandemics have forced humans to break with the past and imagine their world anew. This one is no different. It is a portal, a gateway between one world and the next. We can choose to walk through it, dragging the carcasses of our prejudice and hatred, our avarice, our data banks and dead ideas, our dead rivers and smoky skies behind us. Or we can walk through lightly, with little luggage, ready to imagine another world. And ready to fight for it."
As highlighted in observation #12, the pandemic means something different to each of us, and we each need to determine how we’ll manage and process it – as an opportunity to reimagine and remake our worlds or to stay largely on whatever course we’ve been on and make tweaks. Roy pushes hard on the opportunity offered by the crisis for substantive change, particularly social change. Her call to action is not only to re-organize our teams or businesses but to re-cast our thinking and re-learn how to be more generous, inclusive, and humane.
Roy’s metaphor stuck in my mind and it arose in various coaching sessions. Eventually, starting in early May, I decided to adapt her challenge more directly. I asked each of my clients to consider the pandemic as a portal and to think about what each might take to the other side and what each wants to leave behind. (I subsequently learned that other teachers and coaches were similarly adapting Roy’s piece to prompt reflection and learning.) Their answers could range from modifying personal habits or beliefs to re-considering leadership values or behaviors to making wholesale changes in their relationships or careers. Regardless of scale, though, the changes had to be concrete and meaningful to the individual.
1. What’s the most important leadership lesson of your experience of the pandemic?
2. What surprised you most about your experience of the pandemic? Why?
3. What from your old life have you decided to give up or to leave behind?
4. What have you decided to (more fully) embrace or to take with you?
5. What change(s) do you hope for, and commit to supporting, on the other side?
While doubtlessly influenced by our respective discussions, threading through most of the responses have been one or more of the following:
Challenge of orientation and focus(or re-focus) on themselves, others, and their responsibilities as leaders and citizens, both for immediate needs and longer term, amidst great uncertainty. For some, used to succeeding in the pressurized day-to-day, the pledge for the other side of the portal is to balance that priority with more future thinking. The issue of boundaries (as in #2 above) was prominent.
Unexpected perspectiveson their leadership and their lives, and the realization that they’re settling for a comfortable status quo (which they’re fearful of losing, as in #8). Most want to be more courageous and, in relationship and at work, make changes to develop their best selves. Many want to do more substantial and transformative work in the world, such as fighting for community, social or political transformation.
Human dimensionsof the crisis for leaders and in all the roles individuals play, with family and friends but also as community members and global citizens. Practically, this translates into caring more for self and others, avoiding being overwhelmed by circumstances, communicating openly and empathetically, demonstrating gratitude and loyalty, and committing to social or economic causes beyond oneself.
