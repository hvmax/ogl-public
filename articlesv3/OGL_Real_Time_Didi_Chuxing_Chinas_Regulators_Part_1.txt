### OGL Real Time: Didi Chuxing & China's Regulators, Part 1

12 July 2021|China, Economic Development
On Global Leadership is introducing a new feature,OGL Real Time, which presents our up-to-the-minute insights on current news and events. We hope these breaking news insights from our OGL team members will help illuminate the events of the day and provide the depth needed to understand global political, economic and cultural transitions and transformations. This inaugural post focuses on China's recent efforts to clip the wings of Didi Chuxing, the ride-hailing app. Chinese regulators announced last week they are investigating Didi, just days after the company's $4.4 billion New York stock market debut. Here's OGL's Doug Guthrie's take on the activities.
Why is Didi’s case so serious?
Didi is one of China’s powerful tech giants, with the largest American IPO of a Chinese company since Alibaba. Since the blowup with Alibaba over the last year, it is clear that the Chinese government wants to send a very clear message to all tech companies operating in China: If you want to operate safely and securely in China today, you must be an ally of the Chinese government. Any company that appears to be going too global too quickly is going to be pulled back into line by the Chinese regulatory system.
Will Didi be punished more severely than Alibaba?
The short answer to this is no. Both companies are being regulated – “punished” – very harshly in order to send a strong signal to all tech companies in China. Both punishments are bad, but neither is worse than the other, but very strong signals are being sent to the Chinese tech sector.
Is China’s tech crackdown entering a new stage? Will data security become a new focus?
First, the regulation of China’s tech industry is not a new thing. Under President Hu (2002-2012), China’s tech industry was largely left alone. However, under President Xi, from as early as 2014, there was a clear signal that all tech companies operating in China would face greater scrutiny than in the past. China’s Cybersecurity Law was the clearest signal of how things would change for technology companies under President Xi. This law was officially implemented in 2017, but it was been discussed and reviewed in China as early as 2015. What has changed is that renewed scrutiny and renewed signals are being sent about the extent to which Chinese companies must act as close allies and collaborators of the Chinese government. (This regulatory arm will not only extend to Chinese tech companies but also foreign tech companies operating in China, such as Tesla.)
The recent changes in this area are two-fold. First, President Xi’s administration has been sending signals that it would be driving toward becoming more self-reliant and less under the control of major trading partners like the United States. Relying on big tech companies for data is a part of this strategy, but it is also about the regulation of the financial-tech sector more generally. Second, it is a mistake to openly criticize Chinese governmental regulators, a lesson learned by Alibaba CEO Jack Ma. As China’s richest citizen and the founder of China’s most valuable company, it seemed that Mr. Ma thought he had reached a status in which he and Alibaba were untouchable. The Chinese government took the opportunity to send a signal to the Chinese tech community that no one is beyond the reach of China's regulatory system. That signal is now being affirmed for many tech giants operating in China. But, again, this is a movement that has been in the works for some time.
As U.S.-China tensions grow, is it becoming tougher for tech companies to navigate China? How is it going to affect Chinese companies that want to list in the U.S. or American companies that operate in China?
U.S.-China tensions are going to affect the ways in which tech companies navigate President Xi’s China. However, this is not just a whimsical move because of U.S.-China tensions. It is a regulatory movement towards big tech companies – both Chinese and foreign – that has been in the works for a while. I expect the recent examples to affect Chinese companies that want to list in the U.S., if only because the IPO process will have to factor in the risk of an unpredictable Chinese regulatory move, as in the cases of ANT and Didi. These tensions will certainly affect American companies that operate in China, and we have seen a number of examples of this in recent years. In addition to reports about Tesla, in the wake of the Cybersecurity Law and in relatively short order, many foreign technology companies operating in China unveiled ways to show they were giving back to and supporting the Chinese economy. This trend will surely continue.

Do you think the Chinese government is seeing national security and curbing Internet firms’ power as higher priorities now than helping them access global investment?
There are two answers to this question. First, the Chinese government curbing global investment is not entirely about national security. This is a stated issue, but it is largely pre-textual. The current dynamic must be seen in the context of the trade war and the rising tensions between the United States and China. The Chinese government is sending a very clear signal to Chinese tech firms and to the rest of the world, that Chinese organizations must work in lock-step with the Chinese government. Companies that have grown too big and global too quickly will be reined in to ensure that their activities align with the Chinese government’s priorities. Second, this must be seen in the context of China’s long-term pivot away from the West, a move that has been in the works for at least the last five years. Chinese firms will be encouraged to go global as long as they do so in ways that are in alignment with China’s global priorities, namely the building of the Belt and Road Initiative and the development of relationships with other countries that are targets for China’s developing trade relations.
Are we going to see the end of Chinese IPOs in the U.S.?
This may very well be the case. It may not be the end of Chinese IPOs in the U.S. in perpetuity, but there may be a serious pause until a renewed engagement doctrine emerges to govern relations between China and the United States. There was much damage done to relations under the leadership of Donald Trump and Peter Navarro -- and it may continue under the new “competition” doctrine articulated by the Biden Administration’s Kurt Campbell. Taking into consideration the experiences of ANT/Alibaba and Didi, any investment bank taking on a Chinese IPO must think carefully about the political and regulatory uncertainties and financial risks that accompany them.
Will there be a complete financial decoupling between the U.S. and China?
This is extremely unlikely. Too many American companies are deeply dependent on China’s manufacturing supply chain. Even if tensions continue to rise, the idea that American firms could simply pull out of China and build an equivalent supply chain elsewhere is unrealistic. China is tied to the U.S., not just as a massive market for U.S. firms but also as the home of the world’s most efficient and integrated manufacturing supply chain – from automobiles to battery technology to electronics to solar panels. The idea that the United States could simply decouple from China economically misunderstands the extent to which major U.S. corporations are dependent on China. It could be done, of course, but major financial consequences would follow.
Doug Guthrie has been a China scholar since the late 1980s, when he began studying Chinese language, literature and history at the University of Chicago. After graduate work at the University of California, Berkeley, he was a Professor of Management and Sociology at New York University for several years (1997-2010) and served as Dean of the School of Business and Vice President for University China Operations at the George Washington University (2010-14). From 2015-2019, he was a Senior Director at Apple and was based in China. Currently, he is Professor of Global Leadership at the Thunderbird School of Global Management, where he is also Director of China Initiatives and Executive Director of Thunderbird Global.
