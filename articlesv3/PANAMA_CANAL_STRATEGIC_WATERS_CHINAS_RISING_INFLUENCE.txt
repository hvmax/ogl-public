At On Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy and, in particular, life in China. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. We have written about economic development in China and China’s economic reforms, U.S.-China relations, China’s changing role in the global political economy, and the history and current state of Chinese politics. With the rising trade tensions between China and the United States, China’s role globally and, in particular, its role in the Western Hemisphere is of growing concern to China hawks in the United States. One issue in particular relates to China’s presence in the Panama Canal. This post explores and illuminates China’s presence in this important trading route.
For more than a century, the Panama Canal has stood as one of the world’s most important waterways, linking the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans and providing a vital artery for global trade. But in recent years, a new geopolitical current has been reshaping the region: China’s increasing presence in Panama and its broader influence in Latin American trade.

Through infrastructure investments financed by its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), diplomatic overtures, and partnerships with local ports, China has made significant inroads into a country long seen as a strategic partner of the United States. Today, two of the five ports, one at each end of the canal, are operated by the Panama Ports Company, which is owned by the publicly traded Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison Holdings (CKHH). It should be noted here that CKHH does not control entry to the ports; the company’s sole responsibility is for loading and unloading ships that enter and exit the two ports they serve.
China’s presence has not gone unnoticed by the Trump administration. In the president’s Inaugural Address on Jan. 20, 2025, Trump expressed his concerns about the future of the canal and his intentions: “We didn’t give it to China,” Trump said. “We gave it to Panama, and we’re taking it back.”
Panama President José Raúl Mulino responded forcefully about the future of the canal and whether it would continue to be Panama’s. “I must reject in its entirety the words expressed by President Donald Trump regarding Panama and its Canal in his inaugural address,” he said.

More recently, before his visit to Panama a little over a week ago, China Hawk and U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said of China’s presence in the region, “having control over the entry and exit points… completely unacceptable” (CNN, 2/7/2025). We note here again, CKHH has no control over the entry and exit of the canal, but this seems to be the rhetoric that is selling.
We would note here the tensions that lie in the Trumpian approach to international trade and the realities of globalization. We live in a globalized world, and this evolution has been occurring over the last four-plus decades.
China's Expanding Presence
China’s role in the global political economy has changed dramatically in the last 46 years -- and not just in Panama. When Deng Xiaoping traveled to Washington D.C. to visit President Jimmy Carter in 1979, China’s economy was less than one-tenth the size of the U.S. economy ($178 billion versus $2.6 trillion) and there were more than 800 million people living in abject poverty. It was a dark time for China, and opening up to the world was the only path forward. Four-and-half decades later, China’s economy is the second largest in the world, about 65% the size of the U.S. economy ($17.79 trillion versus $27.36 trillion), and the country is a critical player in many aspects of global trade.
In 1980, President Ronald Reagan took a step that would further lay the foundation for China's remarkable transformation from Communist backwater to global economic leader. After his election, Reagan named free-market (neoclassical economics) theorist Milton Friedman his Chief Economic Advisor; and corporations were invited to leave the American shores for cheaper labor abroad. This shift in capital helped build China’s economy, which then gave China the resources to globalize its presence in places like Brazil and, yes, Panama.

Our team has written extensively about the strength of the Chinese economy, examining many topics that explain China’s growing economic position in the world. We have looked and the logic and strength of China’s approach to capitalism (here); we have examined China’s local economic development strategy (here,here,here); we have examined China’s powerful manufacturing supply chain (here); and many other aspects of the economy. It has also been important to examine China’s role outside of its nation-state borders. We have written extensively about this issue as it relates to China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) (here,here), China’s leadership in the reconstitution of the BRICS (here,here), and the nation’s growing presence in Europe (here), the Middle East (here), and the ASEAN nations (here).
China made its economic leaps by simply following the rules of the game: Chinese companies have seen a good opportunity and they have invested in building and operating the ports and the two ends of the Panama Canal. That’s global capitalism, friends. We have all been walking down this road together.
A Historical Crossroads
The Panama Canal has played a defining role in global commerce since its completion by the United States in 1914. The canal’s ability to dramatically reduce shipping times and costs helped cement American dominance over international trade routes, and Washington maintained control of the waterway until the end of the 20th century. Before the canal was built, trade ships would have to sail down the East Coast of South America, around the tip of the continent, Cape Horn, and then across the Pacific Ocean to reach East Asian markets. Since its completion in 1914, ships can simply sail through the canal to reach the ocean on the other side.

When the canal was transferred to Panamanian control on December 31, 1999, it was heralded as a triumph of sovereignty for the small Central American nation. However, with independence came new challenges—chief among them the need for foreign investment to maintain and expand the canal’s aging infrastructure.
Enter China. Since the canal’s expansion in 2016, which was underwritten largely by Chinese investment, the canal has been able to service larger ships transiting its locks. Importantly, it has also grown in significance, serving as a critical shortcut for vessels transporting everything from crude oil to consumer goods.
China’s Deepening Ties
In 2017, Panama stunned many in the international community by formally severing diplomatic ties with Taiwan in favor of China. The shift was more than symbolic; it was the culmination of years of Chinese economic engagement in the country.
Since then, Chinese state-backed firms have secured key contracts for infrastructure projects, including port expansions in Colón and Balboa, both major trade hubs at either end of the canal. These projects, backed by billions in investment, have given China a foothold in one of the world’s most strategically located countries.
China is now the second-largest user of the Panama Canal, after the United States, and its growing commercial presence is undeniable. Chinese firms have invested heavily in Panama’s logistics sector, acquiring stakes in key ports and expanding transshipment capabilities that connect the canal to wider trade networks. Here again, this is global capitalism at work.
A New Maritime Order?
For Panama, China’s investments represent both an opportunity and a challenge. The economic benefits of Chinese infrastructure projects are clear, bringing jobs and modernizing essential trade facilities. But these developments have also sparked concerns about whether Panama is shifting too far into Beijing’s orbit.
The U.S. government has expressed unease over China’s expanding presence in Panama, viewing it as part of Beijing’s broader strategy to extend its global maritime reach. Washington has quietly pressured Panamanian officials to maintain a balanced approach, warning that overreliance on Chinese investments could come with political strings attached. Panama’s leaders have so far walked a careful line, emphasizing that their country remains open to investment from all partners.

The broader question is whether China’s presence in Panama is a sign of shifting global power dynamics. As Beijing continues to expand BRI across Latin America, Panama has emerged as a key node in its strategy. The country’s strategic location and the canal’s role in global trade make it an attractive prize in China’s broader push to assert economic influence worldwide.
For now, the Panama Canal remains a crucial artery of global commerce, with its waters carrying nearly 5% of all world trade. But as China deepens its economic ties in the region, the balance of power in one of the world’s most strategic waterways may be changing – one port deal at a time.
