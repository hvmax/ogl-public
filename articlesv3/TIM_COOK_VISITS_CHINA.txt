### TIM COOK VISITS CHINA

26 March 2024|China, Chinese Culture, Economic Development
On Global Leadership’s regular feature OGL Real Time presents our up-to-the-minute insights on current news and events. We hope these breaking news insights from our OGL team members will help illuminate the events of the day and provide the depth needed to understand global political, economic, and cultural transitions and transformations. In this post, we examine Tim Cook’s China visit (week of March 18-25, 2024).This post considers the motivations behind the visit and the larger political context in which this important trip occurred. Apple is deeply embedded in and highly dependent on China, and this visit signals much more than a global CEO visiting his company’s second largest market. We examine a variety of issues raised by this visit, taking into account our own analyses as well as what the OGL team in China hears and sees in local media, social media, and on-the-ground popular sentiment.
This is an important time for the global political economy and for US-China relations. We have written extensively about US-China trade relations, with articles analyzing theappointment of Katherine Tai,Janet Yellen’s visit to China,how global automakers are responding to markets and innovation in China, and the state of US-China trade relations in the post-Trump era (hereandhere). We have also written about the complexities of US-China geopolitical relations in particular as the ties between our two nations relates to trade and economic interdependence. In particular, we have written about the ways in which economic powerhouses like Apple and Tesla are so deeply embedded in China that there is no turning back. (See, for example, “Married to China: Apple, Tesla, and the Fate of US-China Relations.” For an extended interview on the topic of Apple in China, seehere.) So, when a powerful and highly visible CEO like Tim Cook spends a week in China, the world should sit up and take notice, and we should ask: “What are the underlying dynamics driving this visit? What is the deeper message being sent here?’
The Apple-China Connection
We believe this visit to China is very important. While the proximate impetus for the visit is the opening of Apple’s new store in Shanghai’s Jing’an District, there are deeper things going on here. It was important that Apple raise the celebratory mood of Apple products in China. Indeed, Apple products have taken a tumble in terms of sales in China in recent months, losing sales to Huawei's Mate 60 Pro, asThe New York Times' Meaghan Tobin, Alexandra Stevenson, and Tripp Mickle havereported.
In addition to the opening of the new store, a second, less widely covered meeting was also crucial. During the trip, Cook unveiled plans to open a new applied research lab in Shenzhen, a plan that has long been in the works and under negotiation. It has been a way of signaling how Apple is giving back to China, the home of Apple’s manufacturing supply chain, according to our sources. In our view, the Apple CEO is signaling to the Chinese government just how important China is to one of the world’s most valuable (second only to Microsoft) and most profitable (second to Saudi Aramco) companies. Cook seems to be signaling to China, 'hey guys, even though things are tense between our two countries right now, we are here, and we are staying; we are partners; we are on Team China.' All this while the US Department of Justice (DOJ) was announcing an antitrust lawsuit against the corporate giant. Strange times indeed.
Lawsuits in the US and EU, behind in AI, sales problems in China, Apple’s 2024 is paved with barrage of challenges. When Apple boldly unveiled the its Jing’an store in Shanghai, the tech giant was putting the world on notice that it is primed to navigate its way through these hurdles in the year ahead.
The Grand Opening
Apple Jing’an opened on March 21, 2024. Located on West Nanjing Road in Shanghai and facing the landmark Jing’an Temple, the new store covers a total of 3,835 square meters. With some 83.4 million yuan ($11.6 million) of investment, Apple Jing’an is the company’s second-largest flagship store after the Fifth Avenue location in New York City. Apple describes the new store “a one-of-a-kind shopping destination where customers can discover and buy Apple’s unparalleled lineup of products and services.”
White magnolia is the city flower of Shanghai. When it blooms, people know spring has come. With a magnolia-themed poster (Figure 1) and the new store logo, Apple Jing’an opened in the season when the magnolia is in full bloom. By interacting with a city through symbols reflecting  local tastes and preferences, Apple demonstrates its mastery of localization. West Nanjing Road is Shanghai’s Fifth Avenue. The location of the new store highlights Apple’s high-end brand image through the combination of cultural heritage, community, and commercial center.
The opening of Apple Jing’an sparked a sensation just like New Year’s Eve, and Cook was the star of this event. China has a huge user base of Apple products and services. Those extremely loyal fans are called “Guofen” (果粉). Together with 150 associates of Apple Jing’an, they surrounded their “Cook” and shouted “Apple Shanghai, Apple Jing’an.”
“Guofen” attending the Grand Opening are not only from Shanghai alone, but also from other regions like Beijing, Liaoning, Guangdong, etc. The queuing started around 9 a.m. on March 20. The first client who made a purchase at the new store was a student who had traveled all the way from Guangzhou, a 1,476-kilometer trip one way.
Tim Cook in Shanghai
On March 20-21, Cook had a full schedule in Shanghai: Took a walk with actor Zheng Kai on the Bund and tasted a traditional Shanghai breakfast; engaged with popular app developers, users of Apple’s products and services; visited Apple stores, met App Contest and Swift Student Challenge winners at Shanghai Jiaotong University; and had exchanges with Apple’s top supplier BYD, Lens Technology and EWPT about the latest production technologies at Apple China headquarters.
On March 12, one day after its announcement of the Jing’An store, Apple announced plans to expand its research capabilities in Shanghai and Shenzhen to enhance support for product lines and the local supply chain. So far, Apple has research labs in Beijing, Shanghai, Suzhou, and Shenzhen, with an investment of over 1 billion yuan (US$139 million). Its Shanghai research lab will be expanded to support reliability, quality, and material analysis for all its products. Additionally, Apple will also build a new “applied research lab” in Shenzhen covering R&D capabilities for the iPhone, iPad, and Apple Vision Pro for support and cooperation with local suppliers.
West Nanjing Road a Magnet for Multinational Corporations
In Shanghai, the stage didn’t just belong to Apple that day. Along with Apple Jing’an, in an area of less than 1 square kilometer in the business district of West Nanjing Road, there were another two heavyweight events.
Howard Schultz, Starbucks founder and chairman emeritus, was present at the launch event of Oleato beverages, which blend coffee with olive oil, held at the Starbucks Reserve Shanghai Roastery. China has been a key growth driver for Starbucks and a more competitive market. The Seattle-based coffee shop chain currently operates more than 6,500+ stores in over 250 cities in the Chinese mainland and more than 1,000 store in Shanghai.
Jonathan Anderson, creative director of LOEWE and one of fashion’s top designers, had also flown into Shanghai to oversee the opening of “Crafted World,” the first public exhibition by the Spanish luxury brand under the LVMH umbrella, charting the brand’s history of handiwork and whimsy. In the Shanghai Exhibition Center, Anderson was having dinner with Chinese movie stars and local celebrities, the day before the exhibition’s ribbon cutting.
Apple Won’t Leave China
From the opening of Apple Jing’an and Cook's activities in Shanghai during his two-day visit, the message is clear: Apple can’t disentangle itself from China.
Maintaining a solid market presence in China is strategically important for Apple’s global revenue and market influence. The importance of China does not just lie on its customer base, but also the increasing demand for innovative high-end smartphones and applications. The Chinese market now serves as an indicator of technological and consumer trends.
Moving production outside China is even more difficult. It is because of local companies like BYD, Lens Technology, and EWPT. China has created smartphone manufacturing hubs that Apple doesn’t know where or how to replicate. Apple would have too many difficulties to find a place that is even close.
After Shanghai, Cook went to Beijing where he reaffirmed  Apple's commitment to remain in China, where it will continue to invest in China’s supply chain, research and development, and sales.
