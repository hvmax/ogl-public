### OGL Q4 2022 Analysis: China Today and in 2023

11 December 2022|Belt & Road Initiative, China, China politics, Supply Chain, US-China Relations
AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy and, in particular, life in China. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. We have also written about thehistoryandcurrent stateof U.S.-China relations. Recently, we have written OGL Real Time pieces about the 20th Party Congress (here,here, andhere). In this post, we take a step back and think about China’s changing role in the geopolitical economy today.
This has been quite a month for China; a big month in terms of U.S.-China relations; a big month in terms of China's response to COVID-19; and a big month for China’s role in the world.
A quick review of China's fall might explain, in part, why this last month has been so momentous. China's steps on the world stage were closely watched globally during the 20th National Party Congress, which catapulted President Xi Jinping into a third term. Then there has been the ongoing controversy over Taiwan, U.S.-China relations, and the trade war (we have written about thishere,here, andhere). There have been conversations during the G20 between China and the United States, and China and Canada.
It's no wonder the last month has been a big one with that kind of preamble. Then the spread of COVID-19, which has continued to cast a long shadow over China's people and economy, has made many doubt the State's Zero-COVID policy. It's a lot for any country to manage.
Politics and U.S.-China Relations
Given this litany of challenges and diplomatic events, the question is: How are U.S.-China relations? Where is China headed with its role in the global political economy?
Our view is that China is going to emerge from this period as a continuing rising power and leader in the global political economy. Many worried about Xi’s consolidation of power in the 20th Party Congress. His speech was strong and forceful, and he was not contrite. He doubled down in several areas, including China’s approach to the Zero-COVID policy; its regulations of big tech and fintech; and its  intention to reunite with Taiwan. It was a strong speech, one which dared the world to challenge China’s rising position of influence in the global economic order.
Many of us China watchers believe that Xi scored some big political points at the G20. In the past, we have written about the ways in which the most powerful nations in the world (first the G7 and then, for a while, the G8) have dismissed China (seehere). Despite the fact that China has the second largest economy in the world, and probably the largest military, China has been given a seat at the children’s table, the G20. We have argued that China deserves much more respect – at least membership in a renewed G8, but maybe even aG2(United States and China).
From the world stage, things looked very good for Xi. He was seen talking and shaking hands with President Biden. He got some good press in China for calling out Canadian Premier Justin Trudeau; and he carefully and savvily distanced himself from Russia.
In our view, there is very little trust for Biden in China. If one reads Chinese social media, the overwhelming sentiment is that no one believes what Biden says. Since the beginning of his presidency, Biden has cast shade on China. His administration sent Kurt Campbell to China announcing the end of the engagement relationship between the two countries, but then he has sent John Kerry (who is respected in China) to talk about collaboration around the environment. He has multiple times spoken about throwing aside the Shanghai Communique to defend Taiwan (our count isfour). There are technology blacklists; and it has taken Biden two years to meet with China's Xi, the United States’ single largest trading partner. It makes sense that Chinese citizens are skeptical of Biden. We believe he can do better. The only real area of trust is in business where Apple, Tesla and WalMart have sought to woo (or at least not irritate) China and its people, which accounts for why these corporate behemoths are the only thing Chinese citizens seem to trust about America these days.
Let’s turn now to China’s economic prospects for the coming year. In general, we have had a fairly positive view of China’s economic prospects post-20th Party Congress. Generally, the economic fundamentals are still strong. We have written in a number of articles about the logic for economic development in China – a careful balancing of centralized targets with a decentralized system that encourages local officials to act in entrepreneurial ways to build industrial clusters. We call thislocal governments as industrial firms(a phrase we borrowed from the great China scholar, Andrew Walder). We have written several case studies about this dynamic (for example,here,hereandhere). This process is not going to slow down, and it is going to continue anchoring China as the most sophisticated manufacturing supply chain in the world. Add to this, China’s aggressive investment in buildinginnovation capabilities. In general, China’s going to be fine, despite the dampening effect of the Zero-COVID-19 policies.
In recent years, the internal and external environment of "Made in China" has been undergoing some tremendous changes: production endowments in China such as labor cost and supply, deglobalization, U.S.-China relations, COVID-19 and so on. In such an environment, will multinational corporations (MNC) and their supply chains move out of China?
It is not the first time this question has been raised. In Q1 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic first broke out in China, the U.S. and Japanese governments encouraged their enterprises operating in China to move back. The two governments offered financial support for re-shoring. But with the outbreak of COVID-19 in other parts of the world, and the rapid rebound of China's economy in the rest of 2020, the share of “Made in China” in international trade has actually not decreased but increased.
Up until now, most MNCs in China have not chosen to leave, mainly because of the following reasons:
China's huge market has made a significant contribution to the overall business of MNCs and is very difficult to replace. For example, GM sold 6.29 million vehicles worldwide in 2021, and China contributed 46%, higher than the 35% from the U.S. market.In most industries, China has formed a complete industrial cluster, which is efficient, high-quality and cost-competitive.

China's new digital business model has allowed a considerable portion of traditional industries to remain in China, although some labor-intensive industries such as clothing, shoes, toys, etc., started moving out 15 years ago.

In some emerging industries, e.g., electric vehicles, while becoming the largest market in the world, China has also evolved into the industry's technology and innovation center. Now, Tesla is sending some 200 engineers from its Shanghai factory to help boost production at its Fremont plant in California. In October 2022, Volkswagen's software division CARIAD announced a plan to invest EUR 2.4 billion in China to accelerate the development of automated driving.

For MNCs, supply chain security has now moved to the top of the corporation’s priority list, many of them are indeed considering or implementing "China +1" or "China + N" to maintain long-term business continuity and stability. However, regardless of whether you call it re-shoring, near-shoring, or friend-shoring, MNCs will face the challenge of cost, technology, and the infrastructure of the recipient country. Given China's infrastructure, production efficiency, and production costs, the return on moving production out of China now is much lower than the return on moving production from Western countries into China 20 years ago. However, even if it is not economically feasible sometimes, diversifying the production base for supply chain security will not change.
When making decisions on future supply chains, MNCs have to balance quality, cost, timeliness, and security. While geopolitical and other non-economic factors are shaping the Chinese and global economies, companies will ultimately be accountable for shareholders and other stakeholders, they cannot deviate from economic interests for long.
For now, how to balance security and benefits is a challenge for MNCs; how to retain MNCs and their supply chains is an examination for the Chinese government, and neither side is easy.
In 2018, as part of the China debt management measure, local government financing platforms were ordered to tighten in order to tame “the disorderly capital expansion” problem. Since the second half of 2021, the real estate market has also tightened. Real estate enterprise and home mortgage loans have declined significantly, bringing about a comprehensive credit crunch and a decline in societal purchasing power.
The crisis of real estate enterprises not only affected the real estate industry and upstream and downstream affiliates, but also affected the "credit driver" of the entire economy. More than 10 years ago, the "credit driver" was mainly in the industrial sector, especially for capital-intensive industries. The equipment manufacturing, energy, chemical industry, etc. were the big borrowers. But in the last decade, housing mortgage and local government financing platforms have become the main driving force for the credit expansion, promoting the growth of financial assets and the purchasing power of the whole society.
From the perspective of GDP, real estate industry accounted for 7.3% in the first quarter of 2021; after the regulatory policy changes in 2021, the proportion dropped to 6.5%. The real estate investment in the fixed asset investment has been more than 18% for a long time, and in the upward cycle of the real estate industry, this proportion could reach 28% at most.
The importance of real estate in the economy covers many sectors. For the real economy, real estate is an important part of GDP and an important carrier to stimulate investment, promote consumption, and achieve employment. For local governments, land auction revenue is an important part of local financial funds. For the financial sector, residential mortgage loans account for more than 20% - 30% of the RMB loan scale all year round, which is a high-quality asset in commercial bank loans. For ordinary families, real estate accounts for more than 70% of the household property structure in China and is the pillar of family wealth.
The manifestations of China's real estate crisis are quite different from those of developed countries. In developed countries, when the bubble of real estate prices burst, it leads to bank asset damage, financial market disorder, and the credit scale shrink. It ultimately brings a negative impact on the real economy. In China, despite the downturn in the real estate market, housing prices have not declined sharply. More prominently, the number of real estate enterprises went bankrupt and the decline in housing sales lead to a big decline in the growth rate of the credit from local financing platforms related to housing loans and government land leasing incomes bring the credit contraction, which then had a negative impact on the real economy.
The real estate crisis should not be regarded as an industry crisis. It is a systemic problem, which relates to the credit stability and macroeconomic stability of the whole. When macroeconomic management authorities look at this issue, they must be precise and qualitative. On the other hand, it will be very difficult to stabilize the macro-economy if the real estate industry is not stabilized, because real estate is the most important "credit driver" of the whole society. In other words, it is difficult for China's economy to get credit without real estate moving forward.
While we have seen policies to assist property developers like the relaxation on credit expansion and bond financing in the past several months, we have not seen a real sign of real estate recovery yet.
If we are going to talk about China’s economy, we must touch on the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). We have written about BRI in a number of different countries, (for examplehere,here, andhere). To take a step back from our specific case studies, let’s look at the big picture:
Combined population of all countries targeted to be involved in BRI: 4.6 Billion.BRI is targeted to touch 61% of the world’s population.Combined GDP of all countries involved in BRI: $29 Trillion.Trade between China and BRI countries: $6 Trillion.Estimated cost of infrastructure needs: $26 Trillion.
• Combined population of all countries targeted to be involved in BRI: 4.6 Billion.
• BRI is targeted to touch 61% of the world’s population.
• Combined GDP of all countries involved in BRI: $29 Trillion.
• Trade between China and BRI countries: $6 Trillion.
• Estimated cost of infrastructure needs: $26 Trillion.
These are big numbers, and as long as China can continue the momentum that has been built with BRI over the last decade, this will be a big part of China’s economic prospects over the next decade and beyond.
Finally, of course, there are the issues of COVID and Taiwan. These are significant and very important issues, so we will leave the Taiwan endgame and Zero-COVID policies for two other separate stand-alone articles, which will be forthcoming soon. Stay tuned.
