AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy and, in particular, life in China. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. We have written about economic development in China and China’s economic reforms, U.S.-China relations, China’s changing role in the global political economy, and the history and current state of Chinese politics.In this post, we share OGL’s Doug Guthrie’s interview with Straight Arrow News’ Simone Del Rosario about the state of China’s economy today (here), responding to questions about China’s economic growth, its prospect for becoming the world’s largest and most powerful economy by 2035, and its changing role in the global political economy today.
