### The Chinese Model of Double Circulation

28 July 2020|China, US-China Relations
AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy and, in particular, life in China. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. We have sought to advance a conversation about what leadership in these times of crisis might look like. We are also building an economic database of cities in China to better understand how jurisdictions cope with today’s economic and political forces. In this post, which is the second in a series on economic recovery in China during the COVID-19 pandemic, we further explore the policy statements that came out of this year’s NPC in May of 2020. Our specific focus here is the policy of “Domestic Double[Q1]Circulation.” – The Editorial Team
By The On Global Leadership Team
In a recentpost, we wrote about the2020 National People’s Congress(NPC), and briefly discussed China’s new policy of the  Double Circulation System. We continue that conversation here. Before diving into the details, however, let’s first review a few key terms and concepts.
Some superficial observers credit China’s rise as simply the exploitation of a deep, cheap labor pool. And while the migrant labor force (the “floating population”) has been an important element of China’s rise, it is only one element. There is also a tremendous amount of strategy here. To be fair, Chinese leaders did not make up this theory, though they have perhaps executed on it more effectively than the Newly Industrialized Economies (NIE) – Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Singapore – that came before.
China’s strategy, in its simplest terms, is: 1) Have a plan. All of these economies have done a great job of driving state-led development. There is no myth that “the invisible hand of the market” or “trickle-down economics” can solve all problems. All of these economies have executed economic growth through a close coordination between the state and the market; 2) Begin with export-led growth. A deep, cheap labor pool has indeed created an advantage in exporting goods. Indeed, if you want to lift people out of poverty, put them to work for wages that undercut global wages and thus attract multinational corporations (MNCs) and their manufacturing; 3) Transition to investment-led growth. Use the capital that comes into the country to lift people out of poverty and gain fiscal resources controlled by the state. Then, reinvest those resource in the building of infrastructure. Put people to work building infrastructure for the country, pay people higher wages, and build out the country. (This is what the United States did in the 1930s under the Works Project Administration.); 4) Make a transition from investment-led growth to consumption-led growth.
This last step is the most difficult and the murkiest. How you build a strong entrepreneurial and consumption-based economy that is no longer dependent on MNCs or the state is tricky. This is the reason economists have come up with the concept of the “Middle-Income Trap” where wages are too high to continue to drive the economy through investment, but the entrepreneurial consumption-based economy has not yet emerged, so the economy stalls.
What does all this mean for what China is doing today? Chinese leaders are very focused on the transition from investment-led growth to consumption-led growth. There is much evidence that President Xi Jinping’s administration is thinking a lot about this.
China’s Double Circulation Policy
China is demonstrating a strong recovery post COVID-19, according toQ2 numbers released on July 16, 2020. China's economy rebounded substantially in the second quarter, with stronger-than-expected GDP growth of 3.2 percent from a year earlier. Chinese economists have said that this momentum is likely to be sustained in the coming quarters, as policies are expected to remain supportive and flexible.
Other key economic indicators have also shown continuous improvement. The country's industrial production is recovering quickly, growing 4.4 percent year-on-year in the second quarter, contrasting with an 8.4 percent decline in the first quarter, according to data released by China's National Bureau of Statistics. This is an impressive rebound to say the least.
Again, affirming the close coordination between the state and the market, the State Council is busy assigning work to assure support of the trends currently in play. Premier Li Keqiang emphasized “stability in six priorities and security in six areas” (六稳六保). The six priorities are stability in employment, finance, foreign trade, foreign investment, domestic investment, and market expectations, and the six securities are in jobs, livelihoods, market entities, supply chain, food and energy safety, and primary-level government operations.
Vice Premier Han Zheng had a working session with the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), the country’s top economic planner, calling on authorities to keep a clear head and fine-tune policies to achieve development goals. Han said China should focus on solving problems and achieving concrete results while making policies for better coordination on macro level to push for resumption of business across the entire supply chain.
Vice Premier Hu Chunhua visited foreign trade firms in the cities of Hangzhou and Yiwu to learn about challenges facing enterprises and to continue to implement local policy. Hu asked his officers to better serve local firms and help them through this difficult period, avoiding a potential rush of “closing-down and moving-out.” Hu also suggested exploring new business opportunities and forms such as cross-border e-commerce and distribution operations outside of China to boost trade. This is a stark contrast between the level of policy coordination on the Chinese side and the view that tariffs and the market will solve everything on the US side. Clearly the Chinese have a better understanding of how Keynesian-style capitalism works than their US counterparts.
Transformation and upgrades
Since the Politburo meeting before the NPC in May, there has been a paradigm shift in China’s economic growth model. The new adjustment is for the domestic market to adopt the “internal circulation” (国内循环) or increased focus on domestic consumption as the primary growth engine to counter-balance global uncertainty. In the last couple of months, the theme has been discussed and policy guidelines have been issued, but until the cases are reviewed, we at On Global Leadership were not able to fully understand how the term“ internal circulation” relates to everyday lives. While investors the world over keep talking about 5G, artificial intelligence, and the Internet of Things, the cases reviewed below give a feel for how it looks on the ground in China. These cases help readers visualize the meaning of the plan for average people. The key phrases are “identify the gaps,” “extend the shorter planks,” and “strengthen the weak links” (找差距、补短板、强弱项). In essence, these terms very much echo the concept of “Kaizen” (continuous improvement), which was popularized by Toyota in the 1970s. Improvement goals are achieved incrementally. Chinese people are content with and even celebrate improvement goals that are realized gradually, one by one, step by step. As the Chinese adage goes, feeling for stones to cross the river (摸石过河).
Jiuting Suburban District (Shanghai) and Distribution
Twenty years ago, in the Shanghai suburb of Jiuting (九亭), the local district government promoted the concept of a logistics park, with the notion of coordinating distribution of China’s goods to the world. Export companies and some third-party service providers started to have “pick-n-pack”, pre-assortment loading, and direct-to-store operations, which largely reduced the manpower needed at the receiving end thus effectively reducing transit time. Today, Jiuting continues on the path to being a logistics and distribution hub, but it is entirely focused on the domestic market. The area now is dotted with rows of warehouses, FMCG (fast moving consumer goods) distribution centers, and newly added cold chain warehouse distribution and services center. With the focus on regional distribution, this location could not be better positioned for receiving shipments from nearby provinces and servicing the 24 million residents of Shanghai.
Baiyang County, Chongqing and Lime Farming
Faraway from China’s busy coastal cities, lime farming was introduced in 2002 to Baiyang in the Wanzhou District of Chongqing (重庆万州). For the population of 35,000, living in this impoverished hilly land nestled in the Sichuan Province, growing limes was a novelty—a new product to be carefully cultivated and harvested. Since those early days, an entire lime industry was created from scratch and has successfully brought the area out of poverty. It stands as a testament in China to how a new idea can be introduced and incrementally improved to create an industry. Today, Baiyang’s annual lime production reaches 35,000 metric tons from its 3,000 hectares (equal to 100 acres) of orchards. In June 2020, Baiyang (白羊镇)announced it was building a three-hectare Cold Chain Exchange Center for lemons. (It will be the size of four Olympic soccer fields when completed.) With a grading and selection processing line from France, specialized packaging machinery, and storage in one controlled environment, Baiyang growers can extend the freshness of their limes for easy delivery around the country.

To date, Chinese people usually think that upgrading industries should serve the process of capturing international markets through the export economy. There has always been an assumption the domestic market would not pay for better quality products if prices increased. However, with the improved standard of living across the country, this mentality has changed.
For the developed world, it is not a difficult leap to think of an end-to-end controlled environment for fruit processing, smoothing the route from farm to table. In China, it is still a leap. It is the “shorter plank” that farmers were only able to sell half of their produce, and that consumers in the city did not have access to fresh produce. Yet China’s total logistics costs are double that of developed countries. The supply chain industry has significant room to improve quality while reducing end-to-end costs. According to recent studies, China’s average spoilage rate is 15 to 20 percent compared to Western countries’ 5 percent and Japan’s 2 percent. In many regions, the industries and services for the domestic market were ignored and now the pandemic is forcing China to invest to improve this area for its own population.
Residential Renovation in Xian
While it is critical to promote investment in new infrastructure (5G, the Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, data centers, etc.), the focus is also on the new urbanization plan is a priority (migrants absorbed by the nearby cities rather than by distant major cities) and large projects in transportation and water conservancy. Some projects improve people’s quality of life, such as the renovation of the old and dilapidated residential areas, and are high on many provinces to-do lists.
In Xian (西安), renovating old residential areas is a municipal goal for this year. There are more than 1,300 locations—covering 20 million square meters of space—in the process of a major face lift. The transformation of old residential areas mainly includes upgrades in infrastructure such as water, drainage, gas and power, public venues, and service options for seniors and children. In some cases, they will also add elevators to old buildings to respond to the increasing aging population and the desire for convenience.

As they remodel buildings, there are discussions about taking advantage of the renovations to add solar energy panels to the roofs of buildings. One of the State Council counselors, Qiu Baoxing, commented that if one-sixth of roofs had photovoltaic power, it would be the equivalent in power generation of the Three Gorges Dam.
The biggest challenge here is whether domestic consumption can absorb the overcapacity and whether the stimulus package will work. The concern is the consumption-side of the equation won’t match the supply-side, which could cause industries to scale back capacity, layoff workers, and spark a deflationary cycle.
We also see in many places that local governments are in a relatively inactive mode. Between fighting the COVID-19 pandemic and returning to economic normalcy, fighting the pandemic seems more acute and weighs more heavily on the local politician involved. For example, in Shanghai, the newly confirmed COVID-19 cases have been in the single digits for months. Yet, most public venues are still in a high-alert mode, with office buildings open only at one entrance and entertainment venues not open for business. This approach leaves people with the impression that China has not yet achieved normalcy. The lower-level bureaucracy has fallen into the safe and cautious mode of“ no action no mistake” (不做不错).
When ordinary residents are marginalized in the decision-making process, they choose to be very conservative in their spending. In the last 30 years, government officials have remained a powerful group. They routinely make decisions in a vacuum, allocating public resources without clarifying their intentions. An administrative system with enormous decision-making power that is not subject to the restraint of public opinion can negatively impact domestic residents’ confidence and trust in the policies. This trust gap subsequently will result in a reduced level of private household consumption.
The goal of consumption-led growth—and the current Double Circulation Policy that has arisen in the wake of the COVID-19 economic fallout—demands a level of transparency to ensure the public feels it can abandon caution and embrace these new opportunities. Unfortunately, today China continues to fall into old patterns. The more external challenges materialize the more the party turns inward to increase its control. But in this complex environment, Chinese citizens expect the system to be more transparent, so they can trust in the decision-making process. The long-term result will be a more cohesive and prosperous people.
Xi suggested that goal in his NPC speech: “We should secure a decisive victory in finishing the building of a moderately prosperous society in all respects, strive for the great success of socialism with Chinese characteristics for a new era, realize the Chinese Dream of national rejuvenation, and see that our people realize their aspirations for a better life.”
The question now is will Xi and the party rise to the occasion?
