10 October 2024|China, Geopolitics, Trade, US politics, US-China Relations
At On Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy and, in particular, life in China. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. Rarely, we get a chance to be part of a breaking news event: OGL's Doug Guthrie was part of a panel for a recent forum, hosted by the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) at the Thunderbird School of Global Management at Arizona State University. The panelists covered critical issues surrounding U.S. foreign policy.
As the United States prepares for a new president in January 2025, national security, economic growth, and the U.S. role in the world will play a central role in shaping both domestic and international policymaking. Those decisions will affect not only the fortunes of the U.S. but also the global economy.

On Oct. 9, the Council on Foreign Relations and the Thunderbird School of Management at Arizona State University co-hostedElection 2024 U.S. Foreign Policy Public Forumto highlight the importance of foreign policy issues in this year's election. The forum featured OGL's Doug Guthrie along with CFR's President Michael Froman and Senior Vice President Shannon K. O'Neill.
The forum's central themes were U.S.-China relations, economic statecraft, immigration policy, and the global economy, including the impact of trade policies, regional partnerships, and national security concerns. Here we break down the lively conversation by the distinguished speakers.
Michael Froman on Economic Statecraft & U.S.-China Relations
Michael Froman, President of CFR. painted a broad picture of the current international landscape, emphasizing the importance of foreign policy for the next administration. "We live in a more complex international environment now than we probably have in 80 years," he said, citing the return of great power politics, international conflicts, and unprecedented competition between the U.S. and China.

Froman linked Arizona’s economic success to global affairs, noting, "Arizona is a great example of how much its economic well-being is tied into the rest of the world," he said. Froman pointed out the state's leadership in foreign investments and exports, especially in sectors like semiconductors and aerospace. Froman emphasized the delicate balance the U.S. must strike in managing economic partnerships, especially with China, saying, "Efficiency is important, but it’s not the only value. Resilience, redundancy, diversification, and national security are also important values."
Froman said the trade-offs between economic growth, national security, and the costs of decoupling from China are real, adding that the semiconductor industry is a prime example of these challenges, and that while reducing reliance on China is essential for national security, it would also raise consumer prices. "Those are the trade-offs. We need to have conversations in forums like this about how much we are willing to pay at the checkout stand," he said.
Shannon K. O'Neill on Regional Trade & U.S.-Mexico Relations
Shannon K. O'Neill, Senior Vice President, Director of Studies, and Maurice R. Greenberg Chair, Council on Foreign Relations, built on Froman’s ideas by discussing regional trade and the importance of partnerships, particularly with Mexico.

"What you saw over the last 30 or 40 years was much more regionalization than globalization," she said, highlighting that most trade occurs within three major regions: North America, Europe, and Asia. (North American trade—particularly U.S.-Mexico trade—is crucial for Arizona's economy.) She stated, "Mexico is Arizona’s biggest trading partner, importing agricultural goods, electronics, and other high-value products."
O'Neill said U.S.-Mexico relationship is evolving, noting that "Mexico is in a pole position because of access to the U.S. market," and argued that the new Mexican administration, led by Claudia Shambaum, has a significant opportunity to deepen economic cooperation with the U.S. as global supply chains move away from China.
O'Neill also discussed the impact of regional trade agreements like the USMCA (United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement) on local economies, particularly in border states like Arizona. According to O'Neal, "Regionalization is key to maintaining economic competitiveness," she said, especially in industries like semiconductors where Arizona has seen significant opportunity.
Doug Guthrie on U.S.-China Relations & Arizona Industrial Growth
Doug Guthrie, OGL Chairman and a professor and director of China initiatives at Thunderbird School of Global Management, focused on  U.S.-China relations, emphasizing the complexity of the manufacturing supply chain China has developed over the past four decades.

"If trade tensions with China escalate and companies like Apple and Tesla are shut out of China, U.S. capital markets will be devastated," said Guthrie, who has firsthand experience of China's relationships with major U.S. companies because he worked at Apple in China.
Guthrie pointed out that companies cannot simply "move to India" and maintain the same profitability if they are shut out of China. He explained how embedded China is in global supply chains: "Foxconn is just final assembly; Apple works with 1,600 factories in China, and these (industrial) clusters have learned efficient manufacturing from companies like Apple."
Guthrie also addressed the growth of Arizona’s industrial sector, highlighting the importance of vocational education in building a sustainable local economy. He praised Arizona State University’s efforts, stating, "What I love about Arizona right now... is that it is building complex things like microchips but also focusing on vocational technical education."
