### The EU has a New Best Friend: Are We Worried?

AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy and, in particular, life in China. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. We have sought to advance a conversation about the U.S.-China relationship, and a deep understanding of local economic development in China. We have written about China's efforts to display its global economic power and leadership in our series aboutChina’s Belt and Road Initiative. This post seeks to extend our discussions about China’s role in the global economy and its growing geopolitical influence in the West. – The Editorial Team

Unlike the sea of China haters or “worriers” in the West, we generally don’t fear China’s economic moves or motives. China may be the world’s largest Communist nation, but it remains a devotee to its own brand of capitalism — one that has proven to be exceptionally effective over the last 40 years.
What does interest us are recent headlines about China becoming the European Union’s biggest trading partner. At the end of February 2021, analysts reported that trade between the EU and China was valued at $709 billion in 2020, compared with the EU's $671 billion of imports and exports from the United States. Ouch.
China's economy recovered faster than other nations during the COVID-19 pandemic, and it was the only major global economy to see growth in 2020. Trade with Europe has been a factor. As China recovered, the EU’s cars and luxury goods were in demand in Beijing, and China shipped medical equipment and electronics to meet Europe’s growing demand.
The U.S. and the UK remain the EU's largest export markets, but U.S. imports with the EU were down 13.2% and exports down 8.2% in 2020. Part of those reductions can be blamed on the pandemic, of course, but the more influential factor was former President Trump's decision to use trade disputes to batter our EU allies. The numbers reflect the downside of those kinds of disputes in global trade. US trade volume with the EU was $671 billion in 2020, down from $746 billion in 2019.
So, as the US was putting a controversial and self-destructive headlock on our EU partners, China was looking to deepen its ties with the Europeans. Eventually, they crafted the Comprehensive Agreement on Investment (CAI) that would enhance trade between the two. And, more importantly, giving EU companies even greater access to the Chinese marketplace.
The EU is one of the United States’ most important trading partners. That it is trying to build a stronger, more vibrant trading relationship with China should be understood as the threat that it is--not because the EU will ally with China on every issue, but because the EU will be slow to partner with the US as it looks to hold China in check for everything from military incursions to human rights. In the wake of four years of an antagonistic relationship with China and as China begins to pivot away from the US, we should all be aware that blossoming China-EU relations could significantly shift the balance of power in global trade relations.
The CAI deal still must be approved by European nations, and there are some sticking points around enforcement, regulatory and licensing hurdles, and the strength of any bilateral agreement with China. The EU was able to win some moderate concessions from China, but there might be an opening for the Biden administration to stand with the EU in leveraging their shared power to strengthen trade relationships.
A February 2021 paper from Yale Law School's Paul Tsai China Center, "A Roadmap for U.S.-Europe Cooperation on China", suggests the rift might be healed if guided by realistic principles: acknowledging the damage of the Trump administration; looking forward instead of backward; recognizing it will take some American humility to rebuild relationships and to coordinate once again on China; and understanding US leadership comes from its ability to convene and mobilize efforts around common problems. Pretty sound principles for moving ahead.
The United States proved to be a fair-weather friend to Europe under President Trump. It  may be the case that both the EU and China have grown weary of American hegemony, and this may be a pivot away to build a much stronger relationship together. We hope that the Biden administration will reverse this movement, if only to ensure that our BFF and key trading partner remains as committed to us as it seems to China at this moment.
