At On Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy and, in particular, life in China. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. We have written about economic development in China and China’s economic reforms, U.S.-China relations, China’s changing role in the global political economy, and the history and current state of Chinese politics. President Xi’s recent New Year Address laid out vision for China in 2025 and addressed some of the ongoing economic and geopolitical concerns facing China. This post lays out some of the ways that Beijing will seek to support and bolster China’s economy in 2025..
The year 2025 is destined to be significant. It’s the first year of the new Trump administration; the last year of China’s 14thFive-Year-Plan; and it has been a decade since the State Council released the blueprint for “Made in China, 2025.”
Yet, how will Beijing bolster China’s economy in such a critical year?
China has already signaled its plans. On December 9, 2024, the Political Bureau (Politburo) of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee held a meeting (the so-called “129 Meeting”) to analyze and study the economic work of 2025. Two days later, on December 11-12, the Central Economic Work Conference (CEWC), which serves as the annual bellwether of China’s economic work, was held in Beijing. Both meetings gather Chinese leaders to decide priorities for the coming year’s economic initiatives, and their readouts contain a wealth of information. In this piece, we unpack some key points and explain how Beijing’s policymakers will stimulate China’s economy in 2025.
Politburo Meeting vs. the Central Economic Work Conference
The Politburo of the CPC is the de facto top decision-making body in China. Typically, the Politburo holds one meeting every month, and in recent years, the December meeting primarily focused on the economy. The subsequent CEWC was an enlarged meeting to deploy the tasks of economic work for the coming year. The CEWC is made up of leading officials of the provinces, municipalities with independent budgetary status, as well as leading officials from relevant central Party and government departments. In addition, some financial institutions and enterprises under central management, and relevant departments of the Central Military Commission (CMC) have also been in attendance.
Based on the tone set at the CEWC, local governments and relevant ministries and commissions of the State Council receive their respective objectives and tasks and will follow up with more detailed plans. According to legal procedures, the plans of each province will be released after being approved by the local people’s congress in January or February. The nationwide work arrangements will be proposed by the Premier of the State Council in the government work report at the National People’s Congress in March.
Both meetings in December carried out the initiatives set by the Politburo meeting on September 26, 2024 (926 Meeting), i.e. change the economic growth mode of China from investment and production-driven to domestic consumption-driven. We believe that the 926 Meeting will come to be considered the most important meeting affecting China’s economy for the next decade because it brought about a fundamental directional shift in the mindset of China’s economy.
Evaluating China’s Economic Performance in 2024
Although the meetings were held in early December, the Politburo meeting anticipated announcements about success in reaching major goals and tasks associated with economic and social development in 2024.
GDP is widely viewed as the most important quantitative indicator of a nation’s economy. In China, the target laid out for 2024 was to grow the GDP by around 5%. Dragged down by unsatisfactory Q2 and Q3 results, the actual performance in the first three quarters of 2024 was 4.8%, and the quarterly data were 5.3%, 4.7%, and 4.6% respectively. The wording of readouts “will be successfully accomplished” (1) suggested the GDP growth goal could be achieved. (On January 17, 2025, China reported full-year economic growth of 5% for 2024, meeting its official target and slightly exceeding economists’ forecasts of 4.9%.)
However, we would like to note here that GDP is not the only measure of China’s economy. The Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) articulated by CEWC in its readout for economic and social development included:
Hard power related – economic strength (e.g., GDP), scientific and technological strength, comprehensive national strength; new quality productive force (e.g., integrated circuits, artificial intelligence, intelligent transformation and digital transformation of traditional industries, green and low-carbon transformation, etc);Soft power related – e.g. deepening the reform and opening up, defusing risks in key areas, and safeguarding people’s livelihood.
• Hard power related – economic strength (e.g., GDP), scientific and technological strength, comprehensive national strength; new quality productive force (e.g., integrated circuits, artificial intelligence, intelligent transformation and digital transformation of traditional industries, green and low-carbon transformation, etc);
• Soft power related – e.g. deepening the reform and opening up, defusing risks in key areas, and safeguarding people’s livelihood.
Despite the good news in Q4 on the economy and CEWC’s assurance that the 926 Meeting “has effectively boosted social confidence and led to a remarkable economic recovery”, there are still questions in the minds of ordinary people and the business community when they look ahead to 2025. The skepticism comes from the concern about the further deterioration of U.S.-China relations and doubts on the effectiveness and sustainability of stimulation policies.
To deal with external pressure and internal difficulties, we have seen some new formulations from both meetings:
Macro regulation and control– the 129 Meeting urged the adoption ofmoreproactive and impactful macro policies. The addition of “more” suggests that under the downward pressure of the economy, it is necessary to implement more accommodative monetary policy, aggressive fiscal policy, and vigorous consumption stimulation.Monetary policy– After prioritizing prudence for 14 years, the 129 Meeting announced a major shift to a “moderately loose” monetary policy. Since 2023, China’s GDP deflator has been negative for six consecutive quarters, meaning deflationary pressure has entrenched in China’s economy. Accommodating monetary policy aims to boost investment and consumption through credit expansion. The issuance of ultra-long special treasury bonds and local government special-purpose bonds will produce more liquidity, allowing Beijing to address local government debt and drive infrastructure investment and economic restructuring.Fiscal policy– “Strengthen unconventional counter-cyclical adjustments,”; for the first time, the 129 Meeting used the term “unconventional” to revitalize more proactive and impactful macro policies. We will see a further increase in deficit-to-GDP ratio (3.8% in 2023), and the central government will increase the scale of fiscal spending and assume more expenditure responsibilities.Consumption stimulation– CEWC outlined nine key tasks for 2025, the first one is “to vigorously boost consumption, improve investment efficiency, and expand domestic demand on all fronts”. CEWC has put forth some measures in response to the prominent problem of insufficient demand, especially consumer demand, but Beijing is not giving out cash to boost consumption fearing free cash may give rise to welfare dependency and lower productivity.

1. Increase direct financial subsidies for household consumption,
add more categories to trade-in program;
2. Raise pensions and increase government subsidies for medical
3. Increase the supply of services to adapt to changes in
consumption structure, fulfill the consumption needs in health,
elderly care, childcare, housekeeping, etc., and new
consumption such as culture, tourism, sports, performances,
and digital etc.
Real estate and stock markets– Realizing the impact of household asset-side performance on the economy, both meetings called for stabilizing the property market and the stock market. The stability of the two markets will help boost the confidence of consumers and market players, effectively hedge against the negative impact of weakening external demand.

Rectify “Neijuan”
In addition to the property market and stock market, CEWC has also responded to “neijuan”, a general social phenomenon which has received widespread concern in China.
“Neijuan” (内卷 or involution ) was first known to the public as a social media buzzword describing people being stuck in a rat race with no way out, and more recently it has been used to describe disorderly competition regardless of cost and profit. In China, In particular, the automotive and photovoltaic industries, which have received strong support from local governments, have the most serious involution.
A cut-throat price war has resulted in heavy losses in all sectors along the value chain of both industries. In 2024, the photovoltaic industry, once a sunrise sector, has fallen into an industry-wide loss.
According to data from the China Passenger Car Association, from January to October 2024, while the revenue of the automotive industry is 8,332 billion yuan, a year-on-year increase of 2%; profit is down 3.2% to RMB375.8 billion; today, the auto industry’s profit margin is 4.5%, down from 8.7% in 2015.
Following the Politburo meeting on July 30, 2024 which urged industries”to strengthen self-discipline to prevent rat race and irrational competition”, CEWC requests comprehensive rectification of rat-race irrational competition and regulating behaviors of local governments and enterprises. Considering the prevalence of local protection, reducing involution is no easy task. But if there is no improvement, it will jeopardize China’s advantageous industries that have been cultivated with great efforts. Some possible entry points could be reducing excessive overtime working and improving environmental protection and workplace conditions.
“The adverse impacts brought about by changes in the external environment have deepened, and the country’s economy still faces many difficulties and challenges, primarily including the insufficient domestic demand, operational difficulties in some enterprises, pressures on people’s employment and income growth, and many hidden risks,” according to the CEWC, looking at the challenges and difficulties ahead in 2025.
In order to overcome these difficulties, the execution of the policies that have been put in place is crucial. We will be able to observe the effectiveness of Beijing’s economic stimulus measures based on:
When the 2025 consumption stimulus measures are introduced and seeing the response and efficiency of lower-level governments;The performance of the property market and the stock market, and seeing whether confidence in the market and residence has been restored;When the GDP deflator turns from negative to positive, and seeing the outcome of boosting domestic demand and clearing excess production capacity;Grassroots reform cases and seeing whether primary-level initiative and creativity have been mobilized.

3. When the GDP deflator turns from negative to positive, and seeing the outcome of boosting domestic demand and clearing excess production capacity;
4. Grassroots reform cases and seeing whether primary-level initiative and creativity have been mobilized.
In 2025, major world powers all face many difficulties and challenges. The solutions to their difficulties will depend on the ability of politicians of respective countries to advance their domestic reform agenda, ever vigilant to the actions of their peers. Which country will be the winner? Let’s wait and see.
