### Inspirational Voices: Returning Citizen Alexander Campbell

21 October 2023|Deeper Coaching Institute, Everyday Leadership, Leadership, Leadership Development
AtOn Global Leadership, we have developed a new theory of leadership that steers away from the C-Suite, the charismatic leader approach to leading. Instead, we focus on what people do as leaders in their lives on a daily basis – every day everyone a leader.We have written about this concept in several articles (see, e.g.,here), profiling people likeDov Gelman,Jiyin Wang, andBrayden Harrington(and for the humility emphasis in everyday leadership, seehereandhere). We have been finding inspiration in our work withViaPath Corporationin support of the company’s work with Returning Citizens. This post is a continuation of anearlier piecewe wrote about On Global Leadership’s theory of Everyday Leadership and the work we have been doing in this area around leadership teaching and coaching with incarcerated individuals and Returning Citizens (see alsohere).
If you read us regularly, you know On Global Leadership has multiple areas of focus. First, we concentrate on China’s economic development and its changing role in the global political economy. Second, we focus onCreative Leadership, and what leadership means for the creative industries but also what creativity means for leadership more generally. Third, we have developed an approach to leadership that we callEveryday Leadership, where the emphasis is on the fact that leadership is not the province of people only in powerful positions but of people in their daily workplaces and lives (see alsohere). Everyone, Every Day, a Leader. This work has recently taken us into an enriching area of leadership withReturning Citizens.

One partner and close collaborator is Returning Citizen Alexander Campbell. Alexander is an amazing individual and a remarkable leader. He is an individual who completely changed his approach to life and leadership during the 26 years he spent incarcerated in a Virginia prison. While there, Alexander obtained an associate's degree, and he honed his skills as a teacher, tutoring other inmates in English, Art, History, and Religious Studies. He wrote 10 plays and produced eight of them, one of which, “Encountering Faith,” was performed at St. Vianney Catholic Church. After his release, Alexander continued to pursue his education, graduating with a Certificate in Business and Entrepreneurship from Georgetown University.
In 2022, Alexander began working with Jude House, a recovery/returning citizen’s co-ed transitional unit that housed 40 persons. There, he established various programs, a library, the cognitive behavioral workout, and facilitated a mentoring program called Redeem and Restore, which is offered by Reverend Dr. Johnathan Queen of First Baptist Church of Glenarden.
Currently, Alexander is the Strategic Solutions Manager for Less Is More Events, LLC (LIME) and LIME Cares, where he serves as a Trainer and Hiring Agent for Returning Citizens. He also oversees a Program at the House of Samaria Transition House that deals with the homeless, Returning Citizens, and those in recovery.
When I first met Alexander, it was through a group Dan Wright, Sidney Davis, Tony Lowden and I were forming called the Returning Citizens Advisory Group. All of the individuals in this group are impressive. As I lectured about OGL’s work in Everyday Leadership, Alexander stood out to me in the group with his relentless hunger for knowledge and for guidance and partnership on how he further the cause of helping Returning Citizens reintegrate into society. Our partnership has gone deep enough that Alexander has proposed building a new program on teaching Everyday Leadership to Returning Citizens and at-risk youth, and coaching these individuals as they navigate their post-incarceration lives.
Alexander describes his vision for impact, service, and change in the following way: “My vision is to return to society individuals deemed broken, mentally damaged, a threat to society, and unredeemable by the masses, back to their respective communities. They shall return as an embodiment of change to help those who are like their former selves, serving as a stop gap to those who are traveling down a path to possible imprisonment, and an answer for those who are in the business of changing lives.”
Listening to Alexander is truly inspirational. But don’t just take my word for it. Watch Alexander’s recentspeechat the Prison Ministry Program:When I was a Child… But then I Became a Man.”Alexander’s speech runs from about 10:30-1:03:20.)
Take some time to listen, reflect on Alexander’s message, and remember: Leadership is not about the position you are in… it is about how you uplift and make the lives of those around you a little better. One message, a few words, one action at a time. Everyone Every Day A Leader. Everyday Leadership.
