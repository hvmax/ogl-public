### China’s Manufacturing Industry: Strategy of Deliberate Pessimism

AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy and, in particular, life in China. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. We have sought to advance a conversation about theU.S.-China relationship, and a deep understanding of local economic development in China. We have written a series about the strategic strengthentrepreneurship in China todayas well as a series aboutChina’s Belt and Road Initiative, andChina’s big tech economyand the companies that are changing Chinese society and the world. We have also written a series about innovative local governance and economic development in China’s provinces and cities (for examplehere,hereandhere). This post seeks to extend the conversation around economic development in China today. – The Editorial Team

How should we assess China's manufacturing industry today? How is this important sector assessed by observers outside of China, and how is it assessed within China? To many observers outside of China, the country is a global manufacturing juggernaut, armed with world-class industrial strength, a powerfully integrated supply chain, and a deep labor pool of 300 million-plus migrant workers that moves around the country, as needed. Others believe that China's gigantic manufacturing industry is built on a bed of sand that is at risk of collapsing at any time because the real innovation in smart manufacturing is happening elsewhere, Japan, Germany, and the United States.
The reality, as is often the case, lies somewhere in the middle. It is true that China’s manufacturing power does depend heavily on the massive migrant labor force – the so-called floating population, which is a tremendous advantage in the global manufacturing economy. However, it is also true that China has invested tremendous resources over the last four decades in the construction of a network of smart manufacturing factories and industry clusters and in building the infrastructure that links these suppliers and clusters together.
But how does China view its own progress in this realm? The annual sessions of the National People's Congress (NPC) and the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) provide a window into China's thinking. While the talks of the incumbent officials were largely flat (and perhaps even a little boring), an outgoing official's speech on China's manufacturing prowess drew intensive attention and discussion among China’s citizens and netizens.
On March 7, Miao Wei (苗圩), deputy director of CPPCC Economic Committee and former Minister of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT), argued during a CPPCC plenary meeting that China is 30 years away from taking a position in the top-tier of manufacturing powerhouses. Miao's speech has stimulated a considerable controversy on social media.
Miao opened his speech with the following observations:
“Promoting a high-level manufacturing capability is a major strategic task in China’s economic development at the present and in the future. China still belongs to the third tier in the four-tiered global manufacturing hierarchy. China is 30 years away from the top-tier manufacturing powerhouse. In recent years, China’s manufacturing has made tremendous achievements. Our manufacture industry is big but not strong, comprehensive but not excellent. This fundamental has not changed. Our manufacturer’s basic capability is still weak, and many core technologies are at the hands of others. The risks of “choke points” (卡脖子) and disadvantages of “weak links” (吊链子) are increasing. The share of manufacturing in GDP has fallen too quickly and prematurely. Not only will it drag down the current economic growth and affect the urban employment, it will also harm the industrial security and weaken our economic abilities to withstand turmoil and competitiveness internationally.”
Many people simply could not believe what Miao said. With ¥31.3 trillion ($4.54 trillion) industrial added value, which is about 30% of the global industrial output, 2020 marks the 11th consecutive year with China occupying the position of the largest manufacturing country of the world (1). China is the global leader in communications equipment, rail transit equipment, power transmission and transformation equipment, among several other categories.
Even if China still lags behind in sectors like integrated circuits, operating systems, industrial software, etc. across the spectrum of industry sectors, many feel it is too much to say that China's manufacturing is decades behind the U.S. Suspicion has also been echoed by international voices. In the Global Manufacturing Competitiveness Index (GMCI) released by Deloitte in 2010, 2013, and 2016, China is ranked as the most competitive manufacturing nation (Deloitte has not published the GMCI after 2016). Similarly, a report jointly released by the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the World Bank notes, “China is increasingly playing an important role as both a supply and demand hub in traditional trade and simple GVC (Global Value Chain) networks, although the U.S. and Germany are still the most important hubs in complex GVC networks” (2).
In 2015, when Miao was Minister of MIIT, he proposed his tiered global manufacturing hierarchy theory, supported by "China Manufacturing Power Development Index Annual Report," which has been released by the Chinese Academy of Engineering (CAE) since 2014. Based on data from the World Bank, the WTO, and statistical organizations of various countries, the annual report uses a proprietary evaluation methodology to calculate the Manufacturing Power Index (MPI) of the U.S., Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom, France, South Korea, India, Brazil, and China. The reports then used to make comments and projections specifically about China.
The 2019 report concluded that although China is the country with the fastest improvement, judging from of core competence, it has not yet joined the second-tier manufacturing nations.
The MPI annual report, on which Minister Miao's arguments are built, does have some questionable points even within the aura of the CAE. The report has been called out for manipulating data in the service of predetermined conclusions. Here are some challenges to the 2019 report:
While China scores 37 points more than South Korea and only 7 points behind Japan (Figure 3), China was assigned to tier 3. Wouldn't it be more reasonable for China to be a tier 2 country?Why do we see a decline of relative score of seven countries on the list including China, Japan and Germany compared to the U.S. in 2019? Did the U.S. manufacturing industry make some significant improvement in that year?Why is a report of nine countries widely positioned as a report on the global manufacturing industry?

There may be more questions on evaluation methodology, including:
The weight of scale is the least among four first-level indexes, less than 20%. Some have argued that it actually should be given the largest weight because finished product output is the most important indicator of a country's manufacturing capability.Among the 18 second-level indexes, the number of world-renowned brands owned by the manufacturing industry of a country has the second largest weight. We don’t know what brands are included, nor can we understand if the methodology can reflect the complexity caused by acquisitions and extension of a brand. For example, because of acquisition, the brand GE or Toshiba are now under Chinese home appliance companies. But according to the evaluation rule, GE and Toshiba brands still belong to the U.S. or Japan and their scores accrue to the U.S. or Japan. As a result, Germany scores lower than France in Quality & Effectiveness in the 2019 report.

It also looks like lacking a systematic and scientific evaluation system is one of the many challenges China's manufacturing industry is facing.
Why are the Chinese officials and subject matter experts in charge of manufacturing industry appearing to systematically downplay China’s manufacturing prowess? Let’s return to Miao’s concerns: ”Our manufacturers’ basic capability is still weak, and many core technologies are at the hands of others.“ Because of the Trump administration's use of national security as a reason to suppress Chinese companies, people like Miao believe that the current mentality of the U.S. government is to undercut China's high-end manufacturing, and could restrict China’s access to American technology under any pretext at any time. After four tumultuous years, there is an excessive anxiety and impatience among Chinese officials and public opinion on the so called “choke points” and “weak links” that are still exposed in China’s manufacturing system. Deliberately placing China's manufacturing industry ranking to the 3rd tier reflects the anxiety surrounding the development of China’s own core technology. However, no country can stay ahead in every industry sector.
Looking back, we can see in China the industry sectors with slower development are the sectors in which the Chinese companies could obtain the technology or products from the outside. The automobile industry is a typical example. At the age of 44, Miao became the general manager of Dongfeng Motor, one of China's three largest automobile companies. These state-owned auto giants have been criticized not being able to develop even one gasoline engine with their own intellectual property rights, because they can rest on huge profits from joint ventures policy. On the contrary, electric vehicles (EV), foreign auto companies like Tesla can set up wholly-owned operation in China, so the Chinese companies cannot obtain foreign technology through JV or technology transfer any more. However, it didn’t slow down the Chinese EV companies like BYD and NIO to develop their own technology, and now they are Tesla’s closest competitors.
In recent months, a saying has been oft-repeated on Chinese social media: "If Donald Trump had stayed in the White House longer, we would have done better in technology self-reliance." The ironic implication is that a trade war and the open disrespect dished out by the Trump administration were positive forces in China’s drive for self-reliance and independence. The development model of China's manufacturing industry in the pre-Trump era was to gradually climb the value chain. In civilian sectors, China advocated vociferously for the development of self-reliant technology, but many leaders worry that actual implementation has been too slow. The Trump administration’s restrictions on Chinese companies like Huawei have forced the Chinese to find alternatives to their American suppliers and technology. The Chinese market is highly competitive, and users will not compromise on quality just because of "patriotism". However, significant anger directed at Donald Trump caused Chinese users to give China's alternative solutions an opportunity. If the technology gap is not that big, improvements can be achieved quickly with massive customer feedback, as long as customers are willing to try. This is not good news for U.S. companies. Historical records have shown that for the U.S. to remain a technology leader, it must maintain some sort of manageable cooperation with China, which also happens to be the best way to defer China's headway towards the high end of manufacturing value chain.
Make no mistake about it: China is driven to be the most powerful economy in the world and the strength of its manufacturing sector is a significant part of that equation. It appears China’s leaders are also worried about complacency. So, leading with pessimism seems to be a key to the China strategy, at least with respect to manufacturing. From the controversy over the international status of China's manufacturing industry, we can see deliberate pessimism is part of the strategy. Inasmuch as Miao’s words are representative of a sentiment among Chinese leaders and engineers. If the U.S. and China are more confident in their own competencies and are more optimistic about the future, it will be easier for the two countries to find shared concerns, common interests, and areas for cooperation. We may still have hope.
