On Global Leadership's feature, OGL Real Time, presents our up-to-the-minute insights on current news and events. We hope these breaking news insights from our OGL team members will help illuminate the events of the day and provide the depth needed to understand global political, economic and cultural transitions and transformations. This post reflects some questions OGL's Doug Guthrie was asked to respond to about the latest activities in China. In this modified OGL Real Time post, we address the tensions reflecting the latest regulatory actions in China.
What do you think is the main driving factor of Xi’s sweeping crackdown on tech/private enterprise -- or his push for “common prosperity?” Is it really about creating a more equitable society? Or is it about exerting more power and control on how the economy and society are governed? Or is it about Xi’s determination to be nominated next year for a third term?  What is the ultimate purpose?
You raise three issues — three hypotheses — all of which may have some basis in truth. Let me address each in turn. However, let me first give some general context to the broader dynamic you are addressing. As you note, we are nearing the one-year anniversary of the crackdown on Alibaba and the suspension of the ANT Financial IPO. This was an important moment in China’s next phase of development, and there have been many hypotheses surrounding what was actually happening behind the scenes. First, just to get one issue out of the way: Xi *will* be nominated for a third term. He set this process in motion five years ago, and it is difficult for me to imagine that he is not going to be nominated for a third term. But it is unlikely that he has launched the attack on Chinese big tech as a way of ensuring his third term. He clearly believes that a third term is justified, but the attack on Chinese tech is not related to this.
Your other two hypotheses are much more on point. Let’s deal with regulation first. In December, the Alibaba Group, the parent company of ANT Group, and its affiliates were subjected to a series of regulatory measures, which included an antitrust investigation and several administrative fines. Within two months, the company’s stock price fell 20%. Alibaba and ANT executives cried uncle in December, working with Chinese officials to “rectify” its many regulatory issues. What happened to Alibaba suggests that Chinese Internet enterprises – represented at the forefront by Alibaba and Tencent (but later Didi, Bytedance and several educational companies) – have entered a new stage of scrutiny by the Chinese government. They will no longer be able to stay under the protective umbrella of Internet or technology, outside of supervision from the Chinese government. The regulatory measures here tell a different story. So, bottom line: regulation is at the heart of this, and that may not be a bad thing. The government likely used Alibaba's Jack Ma and Ant Financial as a pretext for launching this regulator campaign, but I think it is clear that they have had the regulation of big tech in their sights for some time.
Finally, let me address the issue of common prosperity. This is not an inconsequential issue either. Xi has been very committed to the issue of balancing the growth of the economy with the project of lifting more people out of poverty and redistributing wealth and opportunity for all. The aggressive moves against the ed-tech tutoring system are clearly framed around the issues of access to resources that allow for social mobility.Do you think it means Xi is taking a hard ideological shift from private capitalism back to Mao-style socialism?
For decades, Xi’s predecessors have focused on pursuing growth. Now it looks like Xi wants to focus on “dividing the pie well” through wealth redistribution.
Just to be clear, Xi is not Mao. Xi might be a power hungry cult-of-personality-type leader the way Mao was, but Xi is also a careful economic pragmatist. Make no mistake, Xi follows in the footsteps of Deng Xiaoping, Jiang Zemin, and Hu Jintao in building the Chinese economy to be the most powerful economy in the world. Mao was an insane leader who unleashed policies — e.g. the Commune System and the Great Leap Forward — that led to the starvation deaths of tens of millions of Chinese citizens. There is no comparison between Xi and Mao.
However, since 2013, Xi has made clear his goal of continuing to reduce poverty and continuing to push forward economic growth that benefits all. Thus, the Common Prosperity movement is not a radical program of redistribution of wealth; it is, rather, a reminder to the country that China remains committed to lifting everyone out of poverty, even if this means taxing the wealthy at higher rates and aggressively regulating industries that disproportionately favor the rich. It is true that Xi is emphasizing a redistribution of wealth in a way that his predecessors (especially Hu Jintao) did not, but this has nothing to do with Mao.What is the impact of this “common prosperity” drive on the economy? Will it hurt the vitality and productivity of the tech sector – the engine that powered China’s economic rise over the past four decades – and undermine China’s growth?
Signs of stress are already emerging in China’s economy at this delicate moment, fueled by COVID-19 resurgence and raw material shortages. China’s GDP growth just slowed to the weakest level in a year in the third quarter, largely due to a severe energy crunch and supply chain disruptions. A real estate crisis triggered by Evergrande’s debt woes threatens to hit growth into 2022.
A couple of issues here. First, as noted above, the common prosperity movement "since 2013, Xi has made clear his goal of continuing to reduce poverty and continuing to push forward economic growth that benefits all. Thus, the Common Prosperity movement is not a radical program of redistribution of wealth; it is, rather, a reminder to the country that China remains committed to lifting everyone out of poverty, even if this means taxing the wealthy at higher rates and aggressively regulating industries that disproportionately favor the rich. It is true that Xi is emphasizing a redistribution of wealth in a way that his predecessors (especially Jiang Zemin) did not.”
Second, on a fundamental level, the vitality and productivity of the Chinese economy has little to do with the tech sector. The Chinese economy is largely dependent on the dynamic nature of China’s manufacturing supply chain, the most dynamic manufacturing supply chain in the world. The manufacturing supply chain is the reason that China will continue on a path of 5-6% growth over the next decade, and no other country (or array of country) is going to be able to come close to the integration of China’s supply chain.
China’s regulation of the tech industry will have little to do with the productivity and growth of the economy. Now, it will have implications for the valuation of China’s tech companies — the equity impact for companies like Ant Financial, Alibaba, and Didi are clear. However, the Chinese government seems to care little about equity markets. While the United States seems to focus on the Dow Jones Industrial Average as a measure of the US economy, the Xi Jinping government seems to care much more about economic fundamentals than it does about equity valuations.
Finally, with respect to Evergrande t,his is obviously a serious situation, but my view is that the debt crisis of Evergrande is being overstated in the media and in the analyses of China’s economy. Local debt in the development of infrastructure has long been an issue for thinking about China’s economic development and the risks therein. My own analyses of the local economic development and debt risks for China suggest that the risks are overstated. It may be the case that Evergrande will need a bailout. But this is not a new phenomenon for real estate companies and banks in capitalist economies (think US 2028). Bottom line: China’s economic fundamentals are very strong — because of the manufacturing supply chain — and China’s economy will continue to be central to the global political economy for a long time to come.
When will this crackdown stop? Do you think Beijing will continue to tighten or relax its control on private enterprise? Is it a sign that the central government is relaxing its scrutiny on Ma and his business, or just using Ma’s case to show to the rest of the business community that the Party is the real boss?
My prediction: The “crackdown” is going to stop now. A couple of signs show this looming outcome. First, as you note, Jack Ma has been resurfacing — recent reports have shown him studying in Spain. More importantly, the Xi administration is very committed to economic growth. They have made their point about the coordination between the government and the private sector. But they know they need an entrepreneurial private sector to continue to drive China’s growth, particularly with respect to the “Double Circulation” system (i.e., the building of a domestic consumption based economy).
So, to answer your question, it might be that the government wants to show all entrepreneurs in China who the real boss is (the Party). In my view, the stronger message is that the government wants all firms — whether private or state-owned — to understand that they have to be in lock step with the government on China’s economic development path. No one gets to think of themselves as bigger or more global than the Chinese government — a difficult lesson Jack Ma learned in November of 2020. However, the Chinese government also knows that it needs China's tech industry for a number of reasons. My sense is that the support and coordination between the government and the private sector is coming back into alignment.
