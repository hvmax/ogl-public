By Dr. Mark Goulston
In the late 1980’s during tense relations between the United States and Russia, President Ronald Reagan said to Mikhail Gorbachev, General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and President of the Soviet Union, “I think the time has come for us to be on a first-name basis. Call me Ron." We can only hope that such thawing of relations might occur between President Biden and President Xi Jinping.
In an imaginary letter penned by Joe Biden to Xi Jinping, the sentiment of unity and cooperation is vividly illustrated. Following a significant meeting in San Francisco, this fantasied correspondence would reflect on the shared responsibility of the United States and China, the world's most powerful countries, in shaping and protecting the future.
President Biden, in this imaginative communication, acknowledges the transient nature of American leadership with its four-year presidential term, contrasting it with the more enduring tenure of President Xi. This acknowledgment underlines a unique opportunity for China, under Xi’s longer-term leadership, to play a crucial role in global affairs and concerns. Biden’s letter suggests that despite ideological differences between democracy and communism, there is a mutual calling to protect and preserve a world in peril that the two of them are in a unique position to respond to.
The letter proposes a proactive approach, symbolized by monthly calls between the two leaders, to address global challenges. This idea moves beyond mere diplomatic formalities, envisioning a cooperative and collaborative partnership that transcends political and philosophical divides. It emphasizes the importance of consistency in leadership, especially in the context of global crises, where the United States may experience shifts in policies with changes in administration.
At the heart of this imagined dialogue would be a plea for cooperation in safeguarding the future vs. staying mired in a contentious present. The letter subtly conveys the importance of American and Chinese leadership working in concert, not as rivals but as partners in stewardship. The informal sign-off, "call me Joe," humanizes the discourse, moving away from formalities to a more personal, direct form of communication.
This fantasied letter is more than a diplomatic gesture; it's a call to action for two of the world’s most influential leaders to unite in their efforts to protect and nurture a world facing unprecedented challenges. It's a reminder that despite our differences, our shared humanity and responsibility to the future can be a unifying force.
Here is a rough draft:
Dear President Xi,
I've had some time to reflect after our recent meeting which I hope we can both agree was a beginning to improved communication and cooperation between our countries.
I'm writing because I specifically need your help and what's more the world and future need your help.
I think you will agree that we are the most powerful countries in the world and likely to be that for the foreseeable future.  You and I are the leaders of those countries. I believe the world and the future needyoubecause you are likely to be the leader of China for some years to come whereas whoever becomes President of the United States, whether that is former President Trump or me, we will be gone after four years. You therefore could be the more lasting and consistent leader from our two countries.
As leaders of the two most powerful countries in the world, the future which is in peril is calling out to you and me, and America's next President, to protect, preserve and safeguard it. This doesn't mean that we need to agree on our philosophy or many policies. However I do think we are both being called upon by the future of the world and this planet to help it survive and hopefully thrive.
With that in mind I would like to suggest that you and I proactively vs. reactively responding to crises have a monthly call where we can both have advisors present or not to check in with each other and to discuss global issues and progress we are together making and where we might do even more to protect and preserve the future.
As I mentioned, you are the more important person in this because you will likely continue to be the leader of your country whereas our leadership can change every four years and depending on which of our political parties is at the helm will not have the consistency that you could offer.
What do you say?
And BTW... call me Joe.
