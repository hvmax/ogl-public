3tOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy and, in particular, life in China. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. We have sought to advance a conversation about the U.S.-China relationship, and a deep understanding of local economic development in China. We have been writing about the U.S.-China Trade War as it relates toinnovation in the Chinese economy. We have written a series aboutentrepreneurship in China todayanda series aboutChina’s Belt and Road Initiative, and, more recently, about thestrategic strength oflocal economic development in China’s 2nd and 3rd tier cities. This post adds to that conversation. – The Editorial Team

In the four decades since its economic opening in 1978, China has evolved from one of the poorest countries on earth to the world’s second largest economy. Throughout this process, urbanization has been one of the most important driving forces. Cities have been and continue to be the main battlefields of China’s industrialization and stages of opening up.
Urbanization has nurtured China’s new middle class, while also driving domestic investment and consumer demand. Since 2007, during the transition from investment-led growth to consumption-led growth, a number of inland cities such as Chongqing (重庆), Chengdu (成都), Wuhan (武汉), and Zhengzhou (郑州) have become rising stars on this battlefield. In this article, we further introduce the development path of Zhengzhou to help readers to understand the logic behind this transformation and thus better grasp potential business opportunities within China’s inland cities.
From County to Provincial Capital
Zhengzhou is a megacity in central China – one that has recently been designated a Tier 1 city – and the capital of Henan (河南) Province. It was approved by the State Council as a national central city in 2016. By the end of 2019, the total area of Zhengzhou was 7,446 square kilometers, its population reached 10.35 million, and 7.72 million of those were urban residents. The city’s total GDP in 2019 was ￥1.159 trillion or USD168 billion. It is a powerful city, and the citizens of Zhengzhou are proud of that power.
It wasn’t always like this, though. In 1948, Zhengzhou was a small county called “Zhengxian,” with a population of about 160,000. Zhengxian county was transformed into Zhengzhou city in 1949. At that time, Zhengzhou had a district area of only 5.2 square kilometers and a population of 191,000. Zhengzhou was sandwiched between the two largest cities in Henan Province: 70 kilometers to the east was Kaifeng (开封), the capital city of the storied Song Dynasty, and 120 kilometers to the west was another ancient capital city, Luoyang (洛阳), Henan’s industrial base.
Railway was the first stimulus for Zhengzhou’s growth. In October 1954, the Henan Provincial Government moved from Kaifeng to Zhengzhou. The geographical location of Zhengzhou – at the intersection of China's two busiest railway lines – played a decisive role in this transition. Today, Zhengzhou is known as the heart of China’s railways and as China’s transportation hub.
Every city in China has an administrative level. The higher a city’s level, the greater its capability to capture resources. Being a provincial capital has moved administrative, economic, educational, and medical resources of Henan Province to Zhengzhou, enabling it to surpass Kaifeng and Luoyang to become the largest city in the province. By the end of 1990, Zhengzhou had a built area of 112 square kilometers and a population of 5.578 million. From a national perspective, even up until the beginning of the 21st century, Zhengzhou still invoked the impression of a “bigger county” – economically developing but still poor and backward.
From 1978 to 2008, China’s development focused on coastal and border areas, attracting foreign investment to develop an export-oriented economy was the key. The focal points of the country were first special economic zones represented by Shenzhen in the 1980s, the Shanghai Pudong New Area in the 1990s, and the Western Development and Tianjin New Area in the 2000s. Zhengzhou sits in central China, neither along the coast nor the border. What could Zhengzhou possibly do to boost its economy?
Zhengdong New District – The Counterattack of a “Ghost City”
The answer for Zhengzhou and Henan Province was to build the Zhengdong New District, a new urban area planned and constructed in the east of the city. In June of 2000, Li Keqiang (李克强), then governor of Henan Province, proposed that “the functions of Zhengzhou as central city must be enhanced,” emphasizing that “currently the primary task facing Zhengzhou is to expand the scale of the city.” Soon afterwards, Henan Province set up a strategic plan to build Zhengdong New District, hoping Zhengdong would propel the development of Zhengzhou and Henan Province.
In 2002, Zhengzhou chose a new district plan drawn by a Japanese firm. In city’s public vote, the plan’s approval rate was over 90%. In January 2003, the construction of Zhengdong kicked off. By the end of 2019, Zhengdong New District had completed a total of ￥500 billion in fixed asset investment, with a built-up area of over 150 square kilometers and a population of 1.5 million.

“So, this is Zhengzhou. And we are on the major highway, or the major road. And it’s rush hour…  And it’s almost empty,” said news correspondent Lesley Stahl in a60 Minutesreport called “China's Real Estate Bubble.” In this program, which originally aired on March 3, 2013 and was rebroadcast on August 3, 2014, Zhengdong was described as a “Ghost City,” with “miles and miles and miles and miles of empty apartments.”
For quite some time Zhengdong was sparsely populated and its office building occupancy rate was low. The empty apartments show on60 Minuteswere actually sold, people chose not to move in because supporting facilities such as stores, restaurants, schools, and hospitals were not ready. What60 Minuteshad missed about Henan, a province with a population of some 100 million, is that filling a 150-square-kilometers new district does not happen overnight. They should have looked at the Zhengdong website more thoroughly. In reality, Zhengdong has successively attracted more than 100 financial institutions, 15 universities, some 70 primary, middle schools, and kindergartens, and over 140 medical institutions including branch of major public hospitals in Zhengzhou.
Today, Zhengdong has lost its reputation as a “Ghost City”. Real estate buyers praise Zhengdong: In Zhengzhou, if you can afford an apartment in Zhengdong, don't go elsewhere. According to the data from real estate service company CRIC, in September 2020, the average transaction price of new apartments in Zhengdong was ￥20,874 or $3,026 per square meter – 70% higher than the average price of Zhengzhou urban districts. People who missed the opportunity to buy an apartment in the new district when the price was still low regret it now.
Zhengdong, especially its first 10 years of development, reflects the characteristics of the first half of China's urbanization. At this stage, with massive investments backed by land finance (土地财政), local government tends to build urban space and infrastructure at a speed beyond the local urbanization level. However, it is financially unsustainable to maintain the expansion of a city through income from land sales alone. Entering the second half of urbanization, local governments’ focus will inevitably shift to operating a city where tax income and consumption will replace land sales and fixed asset investments as key indicators of the competitiveness of a city.
Industrial Upgrading: Foxconn's Butterfly Effect
To operate a city, it is essential to cultivate new and more efficient industries and grow consumer groups represented by urban middle class. In addition to the development of the tertiary sector represented by the financial industry, Zhengzhou has also been vigorously upgrading its manufacturing sector. The local government’s administrative orders are still fostering the financial industry, although this sector is still not fully opened up. The transformation and upgrading of the manufacturing industry depends more on the joint efforts of the market and the government.
In 2010, after years of hard work of officials of Zhengzhou and Henan, a Foxconn project finally landed in Zhengzhou. One month after signing the contract, the project was put into production at "Zhengzhou speed". Zhengzhou Foxconn expanded rapidly. By 2013, Zhengzhou had become the world's largest smart phone manufacturing base and won the title of the “iPhone City”. Today, smart phones have become the largest export product of Henan Province. In 2018, the electronics information industry became the undisputed largest industrial category of Zhengzhou, both in terms of sales and number of employees. Foxconn has brought Zhengzhou and Henan a mobile phone industry cluster and their biggest export product category. Foxconn has brought Henan’s migrant workers the opportunity to work near their homeland, and it has brought Zhengzhou a multitude of new residents.
Foxconn has also brought pressure and motivation to transform and upgrade other industries in Zhengzhou. Although the salary level is equivalent to the average salary of private enterprises in Zhengzhou, Foxconn has raised the working conditions and income levels of ordinary residents in the city through timely payment of salaries, paying overtime in accordance with the law, and providing dormitory with air conditioning. For traditional manufacturing sectors, their survival is determined by the market. Five out of the top six industry sectors in Zhengzhou that existed in 2004 were still in the top six in 2018, but their production efficiency had increased significantly.
The Next Growth Engine
In 2016, the State Council approved Zhengzhou as a national central city, affirming the importance of the city. However, “the potential of tier 1 city, the core of tier 2 city” can better describe the real situation of Zhengzhou. Among nine national central cities in China, Zhengzhou has chosen Shanghai as benchmarking target, and Wuhan is Zhengzhou’s biggest competitor. Comparing the data of these three cities, one can see big gap between Zhengzhou and the other two cities. The task for Zhengzhou now is to bring the city to a higher level, and, at the same time, drive the development of other areas of Henan, so that Zhengzhou’s title of central city is worthy of its name.
Now, let’s shift to local leadership (a topic we at On Global Leadership like to ponder): In June 2019, 55-year-old Xu Liyi (徐立毅) was relocated to Zhengzhou as party chief from the position of Hangzhou mayor. In China, party chief is the top official of a city, higher than the mayor. During Xu's tenure, Hangzhou's digital economy grew rapidly and the city promoted “one-stop administrative service” (“最多跑一次”) reforms. Hangzhou has turned digital resources into a new blue ocean of business by nurturing digital industrialization, traditional industry digitalization, and urban management digitalization. Today, data is regarded as a new economic resource element, the oil of the digital economy. Can Zhengzhou, land-locked with a population of some 100 million, find its data oil field? Six months after Xu took office, Zhengzhou approved the development of the City Brain (城市大脑) , a comprehensive digital city management interface opening to residents and enterprises. Estimated investment for Phase I of this project is ￥130 million.
More significant opportunities may lie in expanding the boundaries of Zhengzhou’s influence to drive the growth of other areas of Henan. Within Henan province, huge gaps exist between urban and rural areas. The seat of government of the six cities bordering Zhengzhou is 70 to 136 kilometers away from Zhengzhou city center, less than a two-hour drive. However, the economy and people’s livelihood in these cities lag far behind Zhengzhou. In Henan Province, 86 million people live outside Zhengzhou, while in Hubei Province, some 48 million people live outside its provincial capital of Wuhan. If Zhengzhou can solve the problem of unbalanced development within the province, catching up with Wuhan is not a mission impossible.
China is a huge country and soon to be the largest economy in the world. Different regions have their own comparative advantages, from population to labor quality to geographic location to resources and industries. If a local government is able to empower its region to find business models based on endowments and comparative advantages, enable local economy to integrate into bigger markets, an underdeveloped area can also join the track of rapid economic growth. Zhengzhou is a powerful example of this dynamic.
In China, the competitiveness of each province is represented by its central city. If the central city is strong, a province’s economy will be powerful. The competition between China's inland provinces will be concentrated in the race between provincial capital cities. In the foreseeable future, the resources of inland provinces will continue to flow into their provincial capital cities.
