### OGL Real Time: Telling the Story of the 20th Party Congress

27 October 2022|China, China politics, Geopolitics
On Global Leadership's feature, OGL Real Time, presents our up-to-the-minute insights on current news and events. We hope these breaking news insights from our OGL team members will help illuminate the events of the day and provide the depth needed to understand global political, economic and cultural transitions and transformations. This Real Time Q&A seeks to further paint a picture of some of the critical dynamics and unexpected outcomes of the 20th National Party Congress.
OGL: In the lead up to the 20th Party Congress, we speculated about how strongly President Xi Jinping would be in his speech. What are OGL's reflections on President Xi's tone during the congress?
China team:Due to the extreme lack of information, it is very difficult to study China's politics at such a high level. Although the report made by Xi, the general secretary of the CPC, at the party's national congress seemed boring and even obscure, the details contained in the report are far more illuminating than so-called insider information or gossip about the event.

On October 16, CPC General Secretary Xi spent nearly two hours reading out the key findings of theReport to the 20th National Congress. To the outside world, it is a report "without surges". The report continued the direction of the previous CPC congresses, "comprehensively promoting the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation with Chinese modernization" as the central task of the CPC over the next 30 years. Most of those concepts, including the relatively new term "Chinese modernization," are not new. While the report didn't propose any new directions, it can also be interpreted as a continuation of current policy.
The report notes:
After establishingXi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Eraas the guiding ideology of CPC, the party has completed a theoretical breakthrough. The 20th Party Congress continues the two-step strategy of achieving the second centenary goal that was put forward in the 19th Congress. The focus of the next five years is on execution and common prosperity, which will be the essence of the governance.For the first time, the report has a chapter on "national security". Despite a few internal disputes, the external environment poses a more prominent challenge to China's national sovereignty and territorial security.The report also has a chapter for science and technology, education, and workforce talent, elevating their importance to major national strategies and setting the stage for their development over a long period of time. In previous party congress reports, science and technology was put in economic construction, education in social construction, and talent in the workplace in party building.Although changes in US-China relations seem to have elevated the Taiwan issue to a new prominence, the report does not propose a timetable for resolving the Taiwan issue.  We believe the CPC still hopes to maintain the status quo with Taiwan, probably until China reaches its 2035 goals. The choice of unification by force depends on Taiwan’s independence movement, or “external forces” stepping over  CPC's red line.There is no sign in the report that China will relax its "dynamic zero-COVID policy" after the meeting. The final decision will depend on how the virus changes, as well as  scientific judgment on the nature of the pandemic by the international community and the World Health Organization.

With the establishment of Xi's central position, the CPC has changed the rules, allowing for the turnover of top personnel to proceed. However, the report followed the party’s consistent theoretical framework for China's development path since the reform era and opening up began.

It’s an orchestrated victory for Xi. All the internal issues were ironed out in the pre-meetings including the final lists of names. We don’t know what the trade-off was, and how much his new leadership line-up cost him.
Other factions within the party have diminished after 10 years of competition. Xi has practically no peer in order to provide  balanced point of views. The positive side is Xi could delegate responsibilities to his trusted followers, and no one is to blame. For the Chinese people, it’s fun to see who’s up and who’s down, but the real issues are economic growth and the people’s lives get better. The challenges are ever greater globally and domestically.
OGL: President Xi came out strongly, in essence “doubling down” on Zero-COVID, Common Prosperity, and the crackdowns on tech and property development. But the arguments all seemed very clear and coherent — strong-handed but also clear and coherent. Is this correct and how are people in China interpreting the October 16 speech?
China team: Any prompt alteration in those areas would indicate his decisions were wrong, and that rarely happens. But we shall see what he does in real lives. The current way of fighting COVID is actually the same as the “precision prevention” prior Shanghai’s lockdown in April and May. When all the dust settles, he has to balance jobs vs. COVID prevention, platform fintech vs. development, growth vs. common prosperity… though the narrative is “not only…but also, as well as…” the real key is still growth, and making the cake bigger.
OGL: In the final days, there was a lot of movement with respect to the leadership team and succession planning — Li Keqiang, Hu Jintao, were the big names here, but there are many other players that we need to know about. What do these moves mean for the future?
China team:Xi broke some norms in the new top leadership mechanism: the top leader's 10-year generational term; the successor line-up selection (in the second five years); and the collective central leadership structure.
The prelude to this was the so called “prepared to be both promoted or demoted” (能上能下) to the central committee paper issued in September 2022. This authoritative party leadership structure will last for a long time because there is no factional force to balance, yet he’s not naming a successor who could eventually form a new circle.

The collective leadership structure during Hu’s period did lose focus due to resource and power grabbing. Unfortunately, the sycophants around Xi could create a corrupted politics that lose the passion and innovation for change and reform that China needs.
With regard to specific personnel arrangements, in addition to hot topics like the missing of the Communist Youth League faction in the politburo, the following areas are also worth noting:
The State Council will be overhauled. In the past, the candidates for the premier of the State Council of China have all had the experience of serving as vice premier. But none of the new Politburo Standing Committee members has such experience. Next year, the premier and vice premiers will all be replaced; this complete reshuffle of the State Council is unprecedented.National security. Li Xi (李希), who serves as secretary of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection of CPC, ranks seventh in line among the Politburo Standing Committee members, one notch lower than the same position in the previous term. It sends a signal that national security outweighs disciplinary inspection. This approach echoes the report with its emphasis on the importance of national security.Promotions of officials with background in aerospace and military industry. Three of the newly appointed politburo members -- Ma Xing-rui (马兴瑞), Zhang Guo-qing (张国清), and Yuan Jia-jun (袁家军) -- all have aerospace or military industry backgrounds. The promotion of these technocrats shows that achievements in related fields have effectively stimulated nationalistic sentiment, and it is also related to the competition between China and the United States.

Overall, in Xi's third term, the CPC's top leadership body, composed of Xi's protégés and supporters, will focus on implementing the major policies set by him. The biggest challenge is how to make convincing and tangible results. The new group also has to gain people’s confidence in handling the economic downturn and complex geopolitics. To think China would focus less on economics and more on security and political stability in the next five years would be a clear misreading of the 20th Congress.
OGL: Finally, a couple on our team have predicted that the most important Congress for Xi was the 19th Party Congress (5 years ago). This 20th Congress was more of a solidification of the political moves that have been under way for the last decade. Please expound on this issue.
China team:The importance of the 19th Congress is establishing Xi's core position and defining the guiding ideology ofXi Jinping's Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era.The 20th Party Congress further centralized Xi's position organizationally.
Xi spent the first five years of the decade leveling his playground by party cleansing, restoring ideologies surrounding the core, and establishing his uncontested position. He fought his way through Bo Xi-lai, realigned the military leaders to his camp, and brought down Zhou Yong-kang who was powerful in legal and administration, with deep cliques in the party and state council systems. At the 19th Congress, Xi presented his vision and goals for the country, then formulated in the 14th Five-Year Plan to become executable projects and guidelines for 2035. At the 20th Congress, Xi was finally able to select his own team and play by his own terms and rules. There are three steps in Xi's agenda: by 2021, eliminate extreme poverty; by 2035, reach modernity, and by 2049, reach Chinese national rejuvenation. The main goal of the 20th Party Congress was to focus on the work of the next five years, which will be critical for the second centenary goal and the race between China and the United States.
