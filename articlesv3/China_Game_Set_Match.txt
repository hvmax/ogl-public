### China: Game, Set, Match?

AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy and, in particular, life in China. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. Among other things, We have sought to advance a conversation about what leadership in these times of crisis might look like. In this post, we take a look at current events and their implications for our time. – The Editorial Team
Last week, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo showed a shocking level of ignorance of U.S. diplomatic history and current geopolitics for America’s chief diplomat. Standing outside former President Richard M. Nixon’s library and museum, Pompeo said that 50 years of rapprochement between the United States and China—begun under Nixon—had been an utter failure.
Describing the last 50 years of détente between the U.S. and China as a failure substantially misses the mark. In that time, China has evolved from an impoverished giant to the second largest superpower and an economy that will soon eclipse that of the United States. China’s version of capitalism has raised some 600 million people out of poverty and risen to become the manufacturing juggernaut of the global economy. Its diplomatic inroads with the U.S. broke the China-USSR connection and helped end the Cold War. And not since 1979 has China intervened militarily in its region or globally. China has not morphed into a U.S.-style democracy, of course, but the potential for that was always only a hope.
Today, Pompeo whines about the realities of global trade: China’s conglomerates such as Huawei, Haier, and TikTok have found their way into the life of this country, and U.S. corporations such as Marriott, American Airlines, Delta, and United are cutting ethical corners to have access to China’s 1.4 billion consumer market. And while U.S. tech engineers often lambaste China as a copycat economy, there is real innovation happening there--and at a pace that would surprise many Americans.
That Pompeo’s speech lacked subtlety is no surprise given the Trump administration’s blunt-edge-of-the-sword trade policy, but his words were still alarming for their impact in terms of where the U.S. heads next. “We must admit a hard truth that should guide us in the years and decades to come, that if we want to have a free 21st century, and not the Chinese century of which Xi Jinping dreams, the old paradigm of blind engagement with China simply won’t get it done,” he noted.
Pompeo’s speech also seemed to ignore the fact that the United States doesn’t operate in a vacuum. It must function in a global trade market, one that has other key nation partners who help decide the fate of future trade and geopolitics. It hasn’t helped the U.S. that the Trump administration has spent three years roiling relationships that took decades to secure and to sustain.
Let me say, I have no illusions about Chinese President Xi Jinping. Since he took the presidency in 2013, he has maneuvered global diplomacy with intelligence, aplomb, and confidence. He has always been guided by his mission to make China the world’s greatest power, at the top of the heap once again after a millennium. He has been willing to risk global censure for his handling of the Uighurs and his aggressive moves in the South China Sea. He is an unapologetic Chinese Communist Party authoritarian ruler. Period.
Yet China’s greatest successes in securing its power in recent years are a direct result of Donald Trump and his administration. By breaking global agreements and protocols, choosing China haters like Peter Navarro to watch over U.S. trade, and irrationally antagonizing American allies, Trump has created a power vacuum that China has chosen to fill.
The Trump administration’s decision last week to raid and close the Chinese consulate in Houston was a junior varsity play. What was the end result? China closes the U.S. consulate in the city of Chengdu and the U.S. has one less avenue of access to how things are operating inside China. Again, America draws a line and then trips over it.
Meanwhile, within a two-month period, China has blown up the 1997 British transfer agreement of Hong Kong and gotten into a skirmish at the China-Indian border, a border that dates back to 1962. What was the U.S. reaction? Certainly, Trump sent U.S. Navy aircraft carriers for war games to rebuff the Chinese, but there has been few complaints about India.
With all of this happening, and with a confusing U.S. policy in response to China’s many moves, it’s easy to not take Pompeo seriously when he exalts: “Securing our freedoms from the Chinese Communist Party is the mission of our time, and America is perfectly positioned to lead it because our founding principles give us that opportunity.”
China has been waiting for us to take our eye off the ball and not push back on their assertive activities around the globe. Donald Trump, aided by his incompetent cronies, has done just that. The United States used to be a counterbalance to both Russia and China, and that approach won us the Cold War. Today, under Trump, our decision to hide behind nationalism and alienate the world has left us impotent in the face of China’s power. If we don’t change our policies soon, or change our leadership, it will be game, set, match for China, and the world will be the poorer for it.
