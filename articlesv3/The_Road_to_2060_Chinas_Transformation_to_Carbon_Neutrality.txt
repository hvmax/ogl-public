### The Road to 2060: China’s Transformation to Carbon Neutrality

9 August 2024|China, China politics, Climate Change
AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy and, in particular, life in China. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. We have written about economic development in China and China’s economic reforms, US-China relations, China’s changing role in the global political economy, and the history and current state of Chinese politics. In this post, we focus on China’s aspirations and innovation around the issue of environmental degradation, specifically on the issue of carbon neutrality. Common views often depict China as a bad actor or a laggard with respect to environmental issues. While China is among the largest contributors is much more complicated. In fact, China has embraced a set of goals and invested in building toward these goals in ways that will make it a global leader on the issue of environmental degradation.
Growth and Ambitious Innovation in China
In previous writing, the OGL Team has spent a significant time analyzing and documenting China’s economic development process over the last four decades (see, e.g., here, here, here). The crux of that analysis is that, while many observers view China as a centrally planned and centrally controlled economy, this is only part of the story. The reality is that China orchestrates a carefully balanced dance between Central mandates and objectives and the encouragement of entrepreneurial economic development activities driven by localities – provinces, municipalities, districts and townships (see, e.g.,here,here,here). We have also given much attention to China’s prowess in the area of innovation and the ways in which local governments are employing the opportunities of locally driven economic development toward innovation (see, e.g.,here,here,here). Environmental degradation and development around environmental sustainability are shaped by both strategies, and China is positioning the country to be a leader in this important space. In this article, we will dive into this crucial transformation for China, introduce its low-carbon transition pathway, the challenges and illustrate through an industry example.
Innovation and the Environment in China
How does this process translate into China’s global standing in the area of environmental degradation and its goals and plans for addressing this important issue? Currently, China is the world’s largest energy consumer and CO₂ emitter, producing roughly twice the CO₂ emissions of the world’s second largest producer, the United States, each year. China also has the second largest volume ever in terms of cumulative CO₂ emissions, about half the total produced by the United States. Yet, at the same time, China is the largest producer of renewable energy and a leader in many parts of the decarbonization effort, such as the manufacturing and application of solar photovoltaic modules, wind turbines, and electric vehicles etc.
In September 2020, President Xi Jinping announced that China will “aim to peak carbon dioxide emissions before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060” (1).The statement means that there won’t be any increase in greenhouse emissions in China after 2030 and the amount of carbon dioxide emitted by the whole country will be offset in other ways before 2060. It is the first time that China has committed to a zero-carbon target, and an improvement on its Paris Agreement goal, which was to peak emissions “by 2030.”
This ambitious goal is a result of both endogenous drive and external pressure. Internally, the pursuing of carbon dioxide peaking and carbon neutrality goals (or simplified as “dual carbon” goal) is a catalyst for shifting the country’s growth paradigm towards higher quality and more sustainability. Externally, honoring these words with actions will demonstrate the country’s commitment to its global responsibilities and leadership. China’s leaders have recognized that, in the long term, the model that made the country the world’s second largest economy will not be economically and environmentally sustainable, so achieving “dual carbon” goal is an intrinsic requirement for China, “not under compulsion, but of our own accord”(2).
Climate Change and Carbon Emissions
China is in the East Asian monsoon region, a sensitive area to the impact of climate change. Its large population and rapidly growing wealth have been exposed to the negative impacts of climate change, an ever-growing challenge to its social-economic development.
A review of the data suggests that, in the past 60-100 years, China’s terrestrial climate has shown a significant warming trend, while extreme weather events have become more frequently, more widely and more costly(3)：
From 1900 to 2018, China's land surface temperature increased 1.3-1.7°C, higher than 0.9-1.5°C globally (1909-2011).Since 1961, although the overall change in annual precipitation in China has not been serious, its fluctuation has significantly increased.In general, the glaciers in western China are shrinking, half of glaciers in China are melting at an accelerated rate.Climate change is raising sea levels along China's coasts. From 1980 to 2019, the rising rate was 3.4mm/a, higher than the global average. Since the 1990s, about 22% of China’s coastline has eroded, and the effects of salty tide intrusion and soil salinization have intensified.

Owing to the rapid growth of the country’s economy and manufacturing capacity China has become the largest energy-consuming country and CO₂ emitter on earth. The energy consumption and carbon emissions of China have the following features:
Energy consumption and carbon emissions have repeatedly reached new highs. The rapid growth of renewable energy has not yet fundamentally changed China's energy structure.Fossil energy still dominates the energy consumption, they the major source of CO₂ emissions in China. Constrained by the energy endowment that is "abundant coal, insufficient oil, and lack of gas", coal accounts for more than half of China's energy consumption and 70% of oil are imported.Power & heat production and the industrial sector are two major sources of CO₂ emission, they are the key focus in China's carbon neutrality pathway.Energy production and energy consumption are spatially unbalanced. The majority of China’s primary energy sources, especially renewable energy resources, are in the western and northern regions, while the electricity consumptions mainly happen in the eastern and central regions.

Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC)
The historic 2016 Paris Agreement sets long-term goals to guide all nations to substantially reduce global greenhouse gas emissions to limit the global temperature increase in the 21st century to 2 °C and preferably to 1.5 °C. NDCs, which contain information on targets, policies and measures for reducing national emissions, as well as the information on finance, technologies and capacity building for these actions, form the basis for countries to achieve the objectives of the Paris Agreement.
After the announcement of “dual carbon” goal, China updated its NDC targets under the terms of the Paris Agreement, namely:
Strive to peak carbon dioxide emissionsbefore 2030and achieve carbon neutralitybefore 2060.Reduce its carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP by over 65 percent from the 2005 level by 2030.Increase the share of non-fossil fuels in primary energy consumption to around 25 percent by 2030. Annual coal consumption must be reduced during the 15th Five-Year Plan (FYP) period (2026 - 2030).By 2030, increase the forest stock by 6 billion m 3 from the 2005 level to 19 billion m3, and increase national forest coverage rate to 25%;Increase total installed capacity of wind and solar power to over 1.2 billion kilowatts by 2030, add installed capacity of hydropower by about 40 million kilowatts during the 14th FYP(2021-2025) and 15th FYP(2026-2030).

Is China’s ambition credible? It is not difficult to find a country that has retreated from their established climate change policy. In 2014, the Australian government repealed a carbon tax that had been proposed for two years. The French government set a goal in 2014 to reduce nuclear share of electricity generation to 50% by 2025, this target was delayed in 2019 to 2035. In June 2017, President Donald Trump announced that the United States would pull out of the Paris Agreement, a major step to walk back US federal climate policy. So far, China has a track record of delivering on major climate initiatives in areas such as energy efficiency, supply of renewable and pollution reduction etc. But China’s carbon-neutrality pledge is on a very different scale, China must achieve an unprecedented reduction in carbon emissions and move from peak carbon to carbon neutrality faster than any other country in history(5).
Policies and Implementation
As China’s quest for carbon neutrality is accompanied by its growing economic scale and energy demand, what China has launched is one of the biggest ambitions set for the next 40 years, realizing these goals will not be an easy task. China’s approach is similar to what generations of Chinese leaders have done in past decades:
Announce a bold vision and then figure out how to attain it through structured experimentation and careful iterations.Implement throughout the country via a top-down policy framework, e.g., from documents issued by Communist Party of China (CPC) central committee, five-year plans to implementation roadmaps in key areas and sectors.Encourage competition by rewarding officials who are performing, criticizing or punishing the laggards.
• Announce a bold vision and then figure out how to attain it through structured experimentation and careful iterations.
• Implement throughout the country via a top-down policy framework, e.g., from documents issued by Communist Party of China (CPC) central committee, five-year plans to implementation roadmaps in key areas and sectors.
• Encourage competition by rewarding officials who are performing, criticizing or punishing the laggards.
In the governance system of China, political philosophy (6) is the fundamental guiding ideology of the CPC, based on which political strategies are built. CPC requests “strategic decisions made by the Party Central Committee be enforced fully, faithfully and unconditionally” (7). Now that Eco-civilization is essential to Xi Jinping’s new development philosophy, achieving “dual carbon” goal has become a key national strategy made by CPC and a new rule of action for local authorities and government departments when they plan their work and decide on actions, governments at all levels are requested to work out clear timetables, roadmaps and execution plans.
To realize “dual carbon” goal, China has put in place a “1+N” policy framework. The “1” refers the guidance and the top-level design, it consists of the two documents issued in 2021(see figure 7) which articulate the schedules, road maps and working procedures. “N” is the implementation schemes in key areas and sectors, all provinces and central enterprises, coupled with supporting measures.
In order to strengthen the coordination of carbon dioxide peaking and carbon neutrality, in 2021, the central government established a working group headed by Han Zheng (then member of CPC Politburo Standing Committee and Executive Vice Premier of the State Council), supported by working groups at each province headed by respective governor.
The 14th FYP is a key policy instrument to realize near term (2021-2025) “dual carbon” goals. Among 20 target indicators set in the 14th FYP, reducing energy consumption and CO₂ emission per unit of GDP by 13.5% and 18% respectively, increase forest cover rate by 0.9% are 3 out of 8 obligatory indicators.
To summarize: The 1+N policy framework sets the targets for the whole country and key areas, establishes China's working mechanism to implement the “dual carbon” goal. According to this policy framework, China must achieve the following goals to realize carbon peak before 2030:
From 2020 to 2030, limit the average annual energy consumption growth rate at1.8%, control the total energy consumption in 2030 within 6 billion tce (8).Undertake a faster transition towards non-fossil energy, reduce the share of coal in the generating fuel mix. Rely on renewable energy for incremental energy consumption by 2030.Promote a resource-saving and eco-friendly industry model and lifestyle, create a system for the effective recycling of resources.
1. From 2020 to 2030, limit the average annual energy consumption growth rate at1.8%, control the total energy consumption in 2030 within 6 billion tce (8).
2. Undertake a faster transition towards non-fossil energy, reduce the share of coal in the generating fuel mix. Rely on renewable energy for incremental energy consumption by 2030.
3. Promote a resource-saving and eco-friendly industry model and lifestyle, create a system for the effective recycling of resources.
Judging from the practice in recent years, however, China does not have the environment to pursue carbon neutrality at a high socio-economic cost. Chinese leaders still struggle to balance growth and economic interests with achieving climate goals. So far, the most effective way to implement 1+N policy framework is still traditional administrative measures.
Target Responsibility System (TRS)
Target Responsibility System (TRS) is the main administrative instrument in China’s policy-first and administrative-led top-down governance model. The promotion of “dual carbon” goal has the same approach.
In industry sector, the largest source of carbon emissions, ministries in Beijing mainly give instructions to eliminate backward production capacity under the framework of TRS. From 2006 to 2015, quantified goals are set in industries such as electric power, steel, building materials, electrolytic aluminum, ferroalloy, calcium carbide, coke, coal and flat glass. During the 13th FYP period (2016-2020), eliminating backward production capacity has become a regular work and the administrative approach has undergone some obvious changes: as long as national objective can be achieved, instead of telling local authorities what to do, the latter are given more flexibility to set their own goals. The central government has also brought in more market-oriented incentive measures such as specific incentive funds, differential electricity prices, and supporting credit etc.
Although TRS usually functions, it is difficult for such pressure transfer mechanism to become a spontaneous drive of local governments and affected people in the work. Due to their weak position during goal setting, local governments, especially at the county level or below, have assumed responsibilities that do not match their administrative authority. As the interests of grass roots practitioners are often not fully aligned with those of higher-level officials, the effectiveness of policy implementation is often questioned, because so-called "there is a policy, there is a counter measure" mentality (8). For many officials, they would rather do something that prevents being accounted for rather than something helps their promotion.
Given China's vast territory and uneven development between regions, how to balance the interests and set goals acceptable to all parties is always a challenge for policymakers. Figure 8 shows the gaming on goal setting and final attainment on energy consumption reduction. The State Council raised goal for 12 provinces which originally set a goal below national target. 3 provinces setting aggressive goals way beyond national target had to apply for a reduction after two years as they just couldn’t make it, their application was approved.
But overall, as long as the will to promote a policy from central leadership has not changed, TRS has proved to be effective. The party's political philosophy has a greater impact on the behavior of officials,
China’s Solar Photovoltaic Industry – A Case Study
The solar photovoltaic (PV) industry is playing a critical role in China’s energy transformation, one of the few strategic emerging industries China believes that they have global competitive advantages in terms of technology, supply chain and market size.
Solar PV power generation is the process of converting energy from the sunlight into electricity using solar panels. In 1839, a French physicist Edmund Bequerel observed the photoelectric effect. In 1905, Albert Einstein discovered the theory of “photoelectric effect”, on which PV technology is based and won him Nobel prize in physics. In 1954, Bell Laboratories demonstrated the first practical silicon solar cell that could convert 6% of the energy in sunlight directly to electricity. In the 1960s, the space industry pioneered the PV technology to power satellites. The 1970’s through the 1990’s saw slow but steady applications of PV technology as energy source. In the 1990’s, the first grid-supported solar PV system was completed in California. In the 21st century, as PV technology becomes increasingly affordable and available, it is considered as a major source of low-carbon energy and is playing an increasingly important role in the global energy transformation.
China owns the vast majority of the world’s solar panel supply chain by controlling at least 75% of every single key stage of solar PV panel manufacturing and processing.7 out of the top 10 companies producing polysilicon, including the top three, are from China, its share on Solar-grade polysilicon has increased from about 30 percent 10 years ago to over 80% in 2022. The steps that turn polysilicon into ingots, wafers, cells, and solar modules are dominated by China as well. What’s more, the top 10 suppliers of solar PV manufacturing equipment are also Chinese. We must give credit to China for the exponential cost decrease and production capacity increase in the last decade, which allows solar power to compete with other sources of power generation. Its success is a result of the coincidence between top-down industry policy and bottom-up entrepreneurship. Through constant trial and error, every party, from governments to start-ups and investors, learn, adjust and improve from practices, the lucky ones have survived and thrived.
China’s early solar PV industry policy was a failure. As the policy supported mainly the supply side and the cultivation of the domestic market was somewhat ignored, it eventually led to blind expansion and serious overcapacity. As a result, the entire industry almost collapsed after losing export markets because of anti-dumping and anti-subsidy measures. Adjusted policy in 2013 focused on expanding the domestic market to help the industry to reduce export dependence. In 2018, with the recovery of solar PV industry and the forming of competitive advantage, the government decisively set the goal of grid parity and reducing subsidies. While the new policy has encountered problems like cheating for subsidies, the fall of some major manufacturers because of technology failure, it has helped the making of a global leading photovoltaic industry for China.
In an effort to reduce the dependence on China, large economies including India and the United States, are investing heavily in the domestic manufacturing capacity of solar PV modules. The resurgence of supply chain sovereignty suggests that security concerns have overrode climate change concerns. Against these head winds, we also see cooperation. In March, 2023, American clean energy developer Invenergy announced to partner with LONGi on a 5-GW solar panel assembly factory in Pataskala, Ohio. On June 4, 2024, the joint venture, Illuminate USA, shipped its very first panels to a new solar energy center under construction in Hardin County, Ohio.
After 2021, with the support of local governments and capital markets, many new photovoltaic projects have started and have resulted in a sharp increase in production capacity in a short period. In the second half of 2023, the price of photovoltaic products fell sharply, e.g. 50% for PV modules. As of July 9, 2024, 9 out of 17 listed companies in the photovoltaic sector that have released their 2024 H1 performance forecasts, are expecting losses totaling 15.6 billion yuan.
To conclude, the path of China’s solar PV industry is to invest huge amounts of manpower, financial resources and time to continuously test and improve existing technologies, keep building capacity to meet growing market demand, add up many small victories to a big one. While industry policy plays an important role, the winners are those lucky ones standout from fierce market competitions.
Looking ahead, China will work in the following directions to maintain its leading position of solar PV industry:
Continue to improve product quality and product efficiency, enhance customer experience.Continue to strengthen solar PV supply chain and maintain absolute cost advantage.Continue to invest heavily in R&D, work on different technical routes in parallel to ensure the mastery of core technologies.Change the business model that over emphasizes on market share and competes with low prices. The business community and local government should control their impulse to expand production capacity and strive for more sustainable and profitable growth.
• Continue to improve product quality and product efficiency, enhance customer experience.
• Continue to strengthen solar PV supply chain and maintain absolute cost advantage.
• Continue to invest heavily in R&D, work on different technical routes in parallel to ensure the mastery of core technologies.
• Change the business model that over emphasizes on market share and competes with low prices. The business community and local government should control their impulse to expand production capacity and strive for more sustainable and profitable growth.
China certainly has the production capacity and the innovative manufacturing supply chain to lead the world in production of solar panels and photovoltaic technology. Some scholars worry about China’s production capacity could flood global markets. As Zongyang Zoe Liu argued in her recentForeign Affairsarticle, “Chinese factories are now able to produce every year twice as many solar panels as the world can put to use.” And, indeed, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen voiced a similar concern in her April 5 speech in Guangzhou (we have written previously about the Yellen speechhere). We are less worried about the overproduction issues raised by scholars like Liu. Our own analysis of the data shows that China’s production in this sector is right in step with global demand. If you add up China’s production to global production, it is true that the *world* is perhaps outpacing demand, but this is healthy competition in an important global industry. This is how markets work. In our view, China’s leadership in this important market is a positive force.
Looking to the Future
In the past decades, China has forged ahead with boosting the economy, improving people's livelihoods and alleviating poverty. During the course, China has proved that the efforts to protect the environment and tackle climate change, rather than being obstacles of economy growth, are new drivers of high-quality development. The Chinese leaders are clear that its “dual carbon” goal will not be achieved only by making commitment or promises, the country needs real and concrete actions to facilitate the transformation of its economic growth model as well as pattern of consumption and everyday life. China needs to promote innovation and cooperation to achieve its climate targets, with the contributions from its people, especially the youth, for an eco-friendly way of production and life. Although such transformation will be difficult, it is an opportunity for China to demonstrate leadership towards a zero-carbon world. What happens in China will go a long way towards shaping the outcome of global efforts to reduce carbon emissions and mitigate the worst-case climate scenarios. The nation has shown commitment and efforts, we wish these efforts to succeed, China is not alone in this journey.
