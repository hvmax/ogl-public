### EXCHANGES BETWEEN CHENGDU AND PHOENIX IN THE POST-COVID ERA

6 March 2024|China, China history, China politics, Chinese Culture, Leadership
AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy and, in particular, life in China. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. We have sought to advance a conversation about the U.S.-China relationship and a deep understanding of local economic development in China. We have written a series about the strategic strength oflocal economic development in China’s 2nd and 3rd tier citiesandentrepreneurship in China today. These case studies are part of a larger project in which we report on the strength of China’s economic development model (e.g.,hereandhere). In most of our writing on this topic, we focus on economic development, but there is also an international diplomacy angle tied to local economic development plans. To extend up Andrew Walder’s notion of “local governments as industrial firms,” perhaps the appropriate metaphor today is “local governments as multinational corporations.” In this article, we look at Chengdu as an example of the ways in which local exchanges between China and the United States continue to build US-China relations. – The Editorial Team
Recently, OGL Team member, Doug Guthrie, found himself at a Chinese New Year’s Dinner Celebration (The Year of the Dragon). Guthrie was invited byGlobal Ties, Arizona, to attend the CNY celebration and give some remarks to the 300+ participants in this celebration. (We have previously written about this eventhere.) At the event, Guthrie shared a table with, among other guests,Rita Marko, President of thePhoenix Sister Cities Organization. Also, seated at the table was a group of Chinese citizens from Chengdu, Phoenix’s Sister City since 1987. Guthrie described it as a remarkable moment of cross-cultural exchange as well as an opportunity to learn about an important city-to-city relationship that has been in place for nearly forty years.
At On Global Leadership, one of our areas of focus has been on helping our readers understand economic development in China, and why the economic transformation over the last four decades has been so successful. We draw heavily on Andrew Walder’s argument that the secret of China’s economic reforms is the Central Government has set up a system in which local governments are incentivized to act like industrial firms. The aggregate national level planning comes from the Central Government in the form of Five-Year Plans issued by Beijing, and then the managers of local jurisdictions – municipal and district mayors – are incentivized to hit the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that fit into this larger plan.
But these local leaders need to be innovative in forging their development paths. It is under this theory that we have written about amazing economic development cases likeZhengzhou,Nantong,Shenzhen,Hangzhou,Zhenjiang, and others. We have also written that this theory and practice of economic development is more powerful for the field of Economics than perhaps previously realized. This theory and practice offer a “third way,” a theoretical insight beyond Keynesian and Neoclassical Economic Theories. (We have begun to unpack this theoretical insighthere.) Along with Walder, we bring to the table the work of Neil Fligstein on “Markets and Politics” andThe Architecture of Markets. We believe that the case of China presents a renewed push for a New Economic Sociology that truly challenges Keynesian and Neoclassical Economic Theories.
In this essay, we build on Walder’s concept of “local governments as industrial firms,” arguing here that the concept, while brilliant, is incomplete. Local governments in China are not simply following the KPIs laid out for them by Headquarters (to continue the industrial firm metaphor). They must be innovative (as in the case of Changzhou and new energy); they must make deals with other multinational partners (as in the case of Zhengzhou and Apple). But even more than these key economic parameters, they must be diplomatic – they must reach out to build the ties that will build economic partnerships around the world. In this sense, building on Walder’s insight, perhaps the key metaphor to best describe China’s rise is “local governments as multinational corporations.”
A Brief Background on the Sister City Program
Founded in the wake of World War II, the international sister city program was first envisaged by President Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1956 as a way of sowing the seeds of peace through people-to-people exchanges.Sister Cities Internationalis a nonprofit organization that serves as the institutional support for US cities that would like to establish ties with international locales around the globe. Nearly seven decades after its founding in 1956, more than 2,000 US cities have formal institutional ties with some 1,800 cities in 123 different countries. Through this program, the organization helps local cities to contribute to establishing a “world at peace,” by supporting the exchange of ideas, learning about local languages, the arts, and culture, and building ties that value the sharing of culture and ideas.
Local governments must undertake these initiatives in a variety of ways. When the City of Shanghai makes special exceptions to attract partnerships with an investor like Tesla, this is more than an economic decision, it is also a diplomatic decision. Or when Shanghai builds a Sister City relationship with Chicago, or Guangzhou builds a Sister City relationship with Los Angeles, or Phoenix forges a Sister City alliance with Chengdu, these are all political decisions as well as economic decisions.
In these exchanges between China and the United States, local governments and non-governmental forces have always played important roles. Given a time when the relationship between the two countries has entered low ebb, person-to-person connections can be the “lubricant” and help overcome differences and stabilize China-U.S. ties. In 2023, exchanges between China and the United States at all levels fully resumed, although the frequency is still below 2019 levels.
An Introduction to Chengdu
Chengdu is the sister city of Phoenix, AZ (since 1987) and also the first city in west China to resume direct passenger flights to the United States(1).
Located in central of Sichuan Province in west China, Chengdu is the provincial capital and one of 15 sub-provincial cities. Being the heart of the “Land of Abundance,” Chengdu has established the reputation as “a city that you don't want to leave to when you come" and "the Capital of Leisure.” People go to Chengdu for many reasons, just to name a few:
It is the happiest city in China; 2023 is the 15th consecutive year that the city has won the honor. Chengdu has its distinct lifestyle that includes less pressure on work and a cheaper cost of living, it provides residents, especially young people, more space and time to pursue self-development and higher quality of lives.It is the world capital of panda. Tourists flock to panda centers in the city to view these cute creatures in their natural habitat.It is a UNESCO City of Gastronomy. Chengdu is the hub of culinary traditions and dishes of Sichuan food, the most widely served cuisine in China, many are well-received globally, e.g., Mala hot pot, Mapo Tofu, Kung Pao Chicken etc. From MICHELIN restaurants to street vendors, mouth-wateringly delicious dishes and snacks are served on pretty much every street.It is a city of history and culture. In the past 2,300 years, the city has never changed its name and location. Chengdu boasts plentiful historical sites like World Culture Heritage site Dujiangyan irrigation system, (refer toTales of Two Cities – Chengdu and Chongqing), Wuhou Temple and the Thatched Cottage of Du Fu etc. (2)

Carrying the history over four thousand years, Chengdu has been transforming as well. Now the city has developed into a metropolis, a thriving economic powerhouse, the center of logistics, commerce, finance, science and technology in the west China.
As one of the nation’s first group of pilot innovative cities and innovation demonstration zones, Chengdu shoulders the strategic mission of fostering China’s high-tech ambitions. Through continuous efforts and explorations made by the city, in “Technology Cluster” Top 100 list of the 2023 Global Innovation Index (GII), released by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), Chengdu ranked 24th globally, advancing 28 notches compared to 2019 report.
Exchanges with the United States
Friendship and people-to-people exchanges, local diplomacy have played a positive role in promoting the healthy and stable development of China-US relations. Under the tide of globalization and urbanization, cities have become the main body of China's local diplomacy due to their unique political status, increasing international influence, and high convergence of resources.
The decision-making of China’s diplomacy is concentrated in the CPC Central Committee. At the same time, since China is a vast country, Beijing is giving more room to local governments in diplomatic activities. China's local diplomacy activities can be classified into two major categories:
1. Foreign affairs activities carried out by local governments as representatives of the central government. For example:
-- Receives foreign dignitaries;
-- Holds important international events (such as the 2023 Chengdu FISU Summer World University Games, the Hangzhou Asian Games 2023 or Shanghai China International Import Expo);
-- Engages foreign consulates in the region, manages foreign correspondents, etc.
2. More often are the activities carried out by local governments independently under authorizations and the policy framework set by Beijing. It makes cities like Chengdu a logical choice to foster strong person-to-person relationships internationally:
-- In areas that serve the local economy, such as attracting foreign investment and foreign trade.
-- Build a network of sister and friendship cities.
Being west China's open window to the world, Chengdu is an important stop for foreign dignitaries to learn more about the country's vast western region. In 2023, when China lifted its pandemic prevention and control measures, Chengdu also restarted offline exchanges with the United States. We have compiled publicly reported foreign affairs activities with the United States attended by top two officials of Chengdu (3), i.e., Ms. Shi Xiaolin - Secretary of the Municipal CPC Committee and Mr. Wang Fengchao - Mayor, in an effort to understand the resumption of China – U.S. exchanges in 2023.
A little bit disappointed because there are not too many engagements. They met Pat Gelsinger, CEO of Intel and executives from GE Healthcare and Jabil. In addition, in May, Wang Xiaohui, secretary of the Sichuan Provincial Party Committee, met with Tim Cook, the CEO of Apple. What these four companies have in common is that they all have made significant investments in Chengdu. In the same period, we see a long list of Americans received by the party chief and mayor of Shanghai, including Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, Tim Cook, Robert Iger, Chairman and CEO of Walt Disney, Jamie Dimon, Chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase; a bipartisan delegation of senators led by US Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer; Gavin Newsom, Governor of California; John Thornton, chairman emeritus of the Brookings Institution, and Linda Mills, President of New York University, and so on.
Comparing the number of international visitors and events, Chengdu is similar to Hangzhou, the capital of Zhejiang Province in east China. Both lag far behind Shanghai in the number of executives of multinational corporations (MNCs). Beijing usually balances between regions on hosting official foreign visitors and large-scale international events organized by the state. But on planning business trips, it looks like executives from MNCs have their own taste.
International Sister Cities
Since June 1981, when Chengdu and Montpellier, France first became sister cities, the city has formed a sister city network covering North America, Europe, Asia, Africa, and Oceania. Now Chengdu has 37 international sister cities and 68 international friendly and cooperative cities (4).
Twined in 1987, Phoenix is Chengdu’s first international sister city in the United States. Since then, the two cities have built a long-standing partnership. Phoenix and Chengdu work together to promote business and cultural opportunities with one another. The connection provides quality opportunities for business opportunities, cultural awareness, and people exchanges. Chengdu supports Phoenix to promote Chinese Week in Phoenix every year. After the 2008 earthquake near Chengdu, Phoenix raised $200,000 to build the kindergarten that was destroyed and sent a delegation to support that when it was reopened in 2011.
On November 26, 2023, the 7th China (Chengdu) U.S. Sister Cities Youth Debate Challenge closed in Chengdu, an event designed to further strengthen people-to-people exchanges between Chinese and American youths and encourage cultural and educational communication between Chengdu and America. Resumed to be held offline, the two-day debate on the topic “whether all museums should be open to the public free of charge” brought 9 teams from Chengdu-area schools and 9 teams from 6 U.S. sister cities (Honolulu, San Francisco, Houston, Pittsburgh, Salt Lake City and Cleveland). Chengdu organizers sponsored students and their teachers from the United States.
Recovering from the stalemate between China and the US in early 2023 due to the “balloon incident,” Beijing and Washington have been gradually resuming  engagements, so do local exchanges as seen in the case of Chengdu：
1. MNCs remain the major force to maintain economic and trade ties.
-- Local officials are happy to meet executives from MNCs, they won’t miss any opportunity to improve their city through the lens of international cooperation.
-- The U.S. business community visited Shanghai more frequently than Chengdu, the number is completely disproportionate. For MNCs, if they want to further develop the Chinese market, they need to walk out of the comfort zones of first-tier cities, i.e., Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen.
2. Despite concern on growing geopolitical tensions, local Chinese local official is not afraid of America, just like the Americans they meet are not afraid of China either. When people continue to meet and talk, it will make impact that creates change and opportunities.
3. Grassroots diplomacy like Sister City program is playing an ever-bigger role. Through programs like youth and student exchange, participants have explored some new experience and may gain insight into the history, values, and aesthetic sensibilities of a different culture.
4. When planning and implementing specific exchange projects, it is necessary to understand:
-- There are differences in the institutions, motivations, and cultures between the two sides, e.g. Chinese officials tend to talk big and vague, American cities usually have much less government funding than that of China.
-- Don't look at these activities in a short-term transactional perspective.
In today’s US-China political climate, exchanges at local levels and people-to-people ties are helping to overcome political and ideological differences. While there are differences, the people of the two countries have many in common. Just like John Thornton said at the Understanding China Conference in Guangzhou on December 2, 2023: “American people and Chinese people are natural friends. They are unnatural enemies ... The more difficulties there are, the greater the need for us to forge a closer bond between our peoples and to open our hearts to each other, and more people need to speak up for the relationship”(5).
1.  Sichuan Airlines resumes Chengdu-Los Angeles direct flight on November 24th, 2023.
2.  Wuhou Memorial Temple is a commemoration for the King Liu Bei of Shu Kingdom (221-263), one of the regimes of the Three Kingdoms (220-280)) and his prime minister Zhuge Liang. Zhuge Liang is considered one of the greatest Chinese strategists and statesman in China. Du Fu is one of the greatest poets in China.
3.  In the current administrative system of China, the CPC party secretary is the top official of a local government, whose role is similar to that of the chairman and CEO of a company, and the mayor's responsibilities are more focused on execution, a role similar to COO.
4.  A sister city, county, or state relationship is a broad-based, long-term partnership between two communities in two countries. A relationship is officially recognized after the official signing off on an agreement to become sister cities. In China, such agreement needs to be approved by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The process of establishing an international friendly and cooperative city relationship is relatively simple. If there is a certain degree of complementarity between the two cities on economy and trade, culture, science and technology, education, tourism, etc., and there is a strong willingness to further strengthen exchanges and cooperation, once the conditions are ripe, the two municipal governments can sign a memorandum on friendship and cooperation and establish a friendly and cooperative city relationship.
