### A Haphazard Approach to the World’s Second Largest Economy

18 June 2021|China, US-China Relations
AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy and, in particular, life in China. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. We have sought to advance a conversation about the U.S.-China relationship, and a deep understanding of local economic development in China. We write regularly about the U.S.-China relationship, and the importance of the trading partnership. In this post, we discuss the new reality the United States must face as China continues its economic ascension. – The Editorial Team
U.S.-China relations are at an inflection point. The provocative activities by the U.S. Senate and President Biden’s National Security Council toward China threaten to provoke a new Cold War, one that will be very costly for both sides – but far costlier for the United States. It is a dangerous game and one the U.S. will lose.
Over the last eight years, relations between the world’s largest economies have devolved into a frosty détente. There has been fault on both sides, and there is intense pressure today for Biden to restore U.S. diplomatic credibility and leadership with respect to China. But is it too late? Does China even want a close and cordial relationship with the United States anymore?
To be sure, Biden is walking a tightrope. The current difficulties with China have been brewing at least since President Xi Jinping’s ascension in 2013, and perhaps go back as far as 2008 in the wake of the global recession. It was also at this time that China launched the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), which some China observers have dubbed China’s Marshall Plan. The tensions were exacerbated by former President Trump’s trade policies and bullying rhetoric. Biden could return to a more civil relationship with China and that would be good for the world and, likely, the people inside of China. However, there is pressure from inside the U.S. to continue the current tough-on-China stance.
In recent weeks, there were positive signs of moving back toward cooperation when Biden sent Special Envoy for Environmental Affairs, John Kerry, to China. Kerry is widely respected in China, and the country’s netizens viewed this outreach as respectful. The message was that despite our differences, China and the U.S. can find areas to collaborate, for example, in the area of climate change. The fact that Xi attended Biden’s Climate Change Summit was a positive sign. A month later, U.S. Trade Representative, Ambassador Katherine Tai, reported “candid, pragmatic” talks with her Chinese counterpart, Liu He. Another positive sign.
Those constructive signs of re-engagement have been overshadowed by rhetoric that put these positive steps toward re-engagement at risk. The National Security Council’s U.S. Coordinator for Indo-Pacific Affairs, Kurt Campbell, announced the era of engagement is over; going forward, competition, not engagement, would be the defining characteristic of the bilateral relationship. Bolstering Campbell’s position, the U.S. Senate passed a $250 billion technology investment bill to help the U.S. better compete with China in high tech development.
As a final salvo, three U.S. Senators (Coons, Duckworth, Sullivan) boarded a military aircraft, flying to Taiwan to announce a donation of 750,000 COVID-19 vaccine doses. A good photo op, but Beijing perceived the exercise the action a “vile political provocation.”
Where does all of this frenetic activity leave us? If we want to continue to influence China, a constructive engagement policy is far superior to one that is anchored in the language of adversarial competition and political stunts. Yes, we are competitors. But what is the point of abandoning the language of engagement? For those of us who fought in the 1990s to help China gain entry into the World Trade Organization, we all believed then that engagement is the best path for economic cooperation and for the transformation of Chinese society.
Cooperation is much more effective than bullying and antagonism. It is not a coincidence that rifts between our two countries have widened in the last four years. Part of it is the result of a China’s shift to self-sufficiency and a pivot away from dependence on U.S.-China trade. Additionally, the rhetoric about China from the former president and his trade representative, Peter Navarro, was incendiary and has no place in high level diplomacy. The language of Campbell is not nearly as disrespectful, but announcing the end of the era of engagement is simply a mistake.
The mistake is clear when you realize there is no way the United States will win a trade war with China. The U.S. manufacturing supply chain has atrophied to the point of insignificance in the global political economy, while China has spent the last 40 years building the world’s most powerful, dynamic, and integrated supply chain. Global powerhouses like Apple and Tesla are in China for market access (China is the second largest market for both companies), but also because China’s supply chain cannot be replicated anywhere else in the world.
Certainly, it is wonderful that the Senate wants to invest in the U.S. high tech sector. Indeed, state-led investment is the reason China has surged so far ahead of the U.S. in manufacturing. Paradoxically, that’s how the U.S. economy grew in the past. The automobile industry rallied after government investment in highways, and the Internet exploded after federal grants to DARPA. China has become powerful by copying our Blue-Sky investment strategy, but it will take us decades to rebuild a supply chain that can compete with China’s.
Finally, Taiwan. The congressional stunt to ostensibly announce a donation of vaccines was not only silly and showy, but downright dangerous. It is surprising that the Biden administration allowed it to happen, though Biden appears to have little power over Congress. This is not China of 1979 or even 1996 (the time of the Third Taiwan Strait Crisis) – it is the country with the largest military and soon-to-be largest economy in the world. Landing military planes in Taiwan is a provocation for which Beijing will likely not stand, and the U.S. diplomatic corps should proceed in a more cautious manner in the future. Symbolism matters.
We have entered a new phase with China, but our two countries remain co-dependent, whether we like it or not. Biden will be pressured to be tougher on China, but he must be guided by an engagement-oriented approach. Hopefully, he’ll choose respectful diplomacy, tariffs will recede, and the Obama-Biden era’s pivot to Asia will reemerge. By relying on engagement through business, social and academic exchange, and respectful diplomacy, we have a better chance of averting a Cold War – a war the United States cannot win.
