AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy and, in particular, life in China. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. We have sought to advance a conversation about theU.S.-China relationship, and deeper understanding of local economic development in China. We have also written about theU.S.-China Trade Waras it relates to China’s role in the global economy. In this post, we seek to continue our discussion of US-China trade relations and China’s growing role in the global economy. – The Editorial Team

China recently made two preemptive moves in regional economic and trade cooperation, putting China in a strong position to potentially block U.S. President-elect Joe Biden if he seeks to adopt a strategy of elevating U.S. foreign policy in Asia again. The Obama administration had shifted its focus to Asia, recognizing Asia’s rising economic and geopolitical clout. The Trump administration abandoned the effort, leaving a vacuum for China to fill. Once these new free trade agreement communities are solidified, others, mainly the United States, will have a hard time altering their courses.
On November 15, 2020, the economic and trade ministers of 10 Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries – Indonesia, Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia, Philippines, Vietnam, Brunei, Myanmar (Burma), Cambodia, and Laos – and five other countries that have free trade agreements with ASEAN (China, Japan, South Korea, Australia, and New Zealand) officially signed the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (RCEP).
The story of this alliance began in November 2011. The 10 ASEAN countries and six Asia-Pacific partner countries that have signed free trade agreements with ASEAN – China, Japan, South Korea, Australia, New Zealand, and India – jointly advocated at the 19th ASEAN Summit and initiated a regional free trade agreement open to all Asia-Pacific countries willing to join in the future. In November 2012, the heads of state and government of the 16 countries formally signed the RCEP framework at the 21st ASEAN Summit and announced the start of negotiations.
Originally, the countries hoped to complete the framework negotiations and sign the RCEP agreement by the end of 2015. But there were many setbacks. First, the United States initiated the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement (TPP) in the region, trying to win over the majority of the RCEP countries and have them join the TPP, which excluded China. Then India turned hesitant, cautious about China’s role in Asia-Pacific economic cooperation. Fearing India may lose out in the competition, Prime Minister Modi tried to negotiate lower tariffs on low-end manufacturing goods and other terms aimed to reduce China’s influence. Finally, in November 2019, Modi withdrew from the negotiations, worrying that his farmer base would reject him. Another important member, Japan, who once declared that it wouldn’t join without India, now firmed up its position to join. After negotiations dragged on for eight years, the 15 countries finally came to an agreement and sign the deal without India.
The world's largest trading agreement so far, covering 30% of the global economy, nearly 30% of the world’s trade, 2.2 billion consumers, and a vast market with the most growth potential. An impressively scaled free trade region was formed. This landmark result revealed the favored choice of a free trade model for the Asia-Pacific region.

The TPP model was an attempt to fuse numerous bilateral trade agreements, and use the "high-end standards" advocated by the United States to establish free trade based on the standards of industrialized countries, including tariffs, trade, intellectual property protection, environmental and labor rules, and other ideological aspects. In the agreement, the United States is not only the "protagonist", but also imposes its preferred trade and non-trade model as the standard of access for all the participants. The goal of the TPP was to use U.S. trade standards to replace other "free trade standards" in the Asia-Pacific region, the world's most active economic territory. This could be realized to a large extent because the United States was willing to open its market and share benefits with other participants, most of which were based on export and industrial supply chain support.
When Trump withdrew from the TPP, it left other participating countries to maintain the group. They eventually came up with the "Comprehensive and Progressive Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement" (CPTPP) that does not include the United States. It also scaled back many of the new standards such as on the dispute resolve system (ISDS), state-owned enterprise subsidies, labor standards, etc. This "shrunken” version of TPP still lacked an anchor – a participant with a sizable population and importing market muscle like the U.S. Instead, the members were all export-oriented countries, making it difficult to have a “circulation" and absorb the free trade.
Once the seemingly "not advanced enough" RCEP is activated, 91% of the tariffs among the member countries will be eliminated within 10 years, and non-tariff barriers will be restricted. There will be security cooperation in protecting digital personal information and network safety, promoting transparency, and paperless processes. With the relaxation of restrictions on the foreign shareholding ratio, at least 65% of the service industry in the RCEP countries will be completely opened up in the future. Instead of re-drafting rules, RCEP only formalizes the bilateral agreements previously signed by the participating countries.
Yet it allows countries to retain import tariffs for sectors they consider particularly important or sensitive. It will have little or no impact on cross-border legal issues, accounting rules, and other services terms. And it will not risk topics that often lead to sharp differences such as ensuring protection of IPR, independence of trade unions, and subsidies of state-owned enterprises, etc. Because of the lower threshold for agreement, it should be easier to reach compromises and increase the possibility of implementation. On top of that, once the common “rule of origin” agreement is refined, it will form a minimum requirement rule of origin within RCEP. Products that meet this standard can enjoy full RCEP preferential treatment. This will help promote enterprises and industries that have multi-nation industrial chains and supply chains within the RCEP, and achieve a multi-win economy, trade, and employment among all members.
The biggest difference between TTP and RCEP is that it is not an exclusive, single-centered free trade model, but a diversified free trade based on the principle of equality and reciprocity among the member countries. All participants jointly formulate, monitor, and implement this “semi-open” free trade model based on their own rules. Obviously, after repeated setbacks, countries in the region have finally chosen this Asia-Pacific free trade model.
As pointed out by many observers and media, RCEP was signed when leaders of Asian countries were responding to three critical events: the COVID-19 pandemic and its economic aftershocks, the tensions in the South China Sea, and the growing divisions between the United States and China. Countries held the signing ceremony virtually instead of waiting for a summit meeting, as originally planned. RCEP is expected to provide more mutual trade and investment opportunities for the participants, so that the countries will be in a favorable position for economic recovery, and China will be able to leverage its power in the Asia-Pacific region and the world.
With this line drawn firmly in the sand, any initiative of the incoming Biden Administration to rebalance toward Asia and constrain China’s growing regional influence will be weakened. In fact, many believe that the new agreement will allow countries in the Asia-Pacific region to have closer relations with China in trade, investment, finance, and services. The "community of interests" and the "community of rules" with China make it harder for any country to "de-sinicize". As many observers said, RCEP is signed at a time when the economic relationship between the United States and the Asia-Pacific region is uncertain, and it is a strong signal of China's expanding influence. RCEP’s lower trade barriers may allow China to treat other ASEAN countries like provinces, and the industries’ outbound movement would be just another form of Chinese manufacturers’ “spillover” effect.
The second move was in a more recent Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Economic Leaders’ meetings, five days later, China’s Xi Jinping said China would like to participate in the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP11) – a trade agreement between Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, and Vietnam.
Next agenda, before the U.S. can get around to it, China is planning to work out bilateral negotiations with the claimant nations on the “Code of Conduct in South China Sea”, which has been held back due to the pandemic. All of these moves were set in motion for China to be a part of the global trading community. Once China is in, the U.S. will have a difficult time changing the rules. Thus, the de-coupling strategy or containment alliance will become more infeasible.
At this point, China is joining any club it can. The criticisms of China’s economic forays always focus on trade and debts, as if China is only eyeing economic returns. But China is clearly weighing the geopolitics. It needs allies, a “community of common destiny.” China clearly remembers what happened in 1971: 76 countries out of total of 128, led by Albania and Algeria, voted the People’s Republic of China back into the United Nations. China knows how important it is to have friends around the world.
