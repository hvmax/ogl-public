We deliver here the final post in our series asking what we can learn about leadership from the Oscar-nominated Best Picture films announced by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Like most of you, we are moved by the culture around us, and often we learn from that culture. We decided to take a look at most of the 10 nominated films and see what insights about leadership we can glean from the characters, themes, or locations. In this, our final Oscar post, we look at the issue of leadership as it relates to teamwork as it is depicted in the Top Gun sequel “Top Gun: Maverick”.
"Top Gun: Maverick": The Art of Team Building
By Doug Guthrie and Sarah Kellogg
For those of us who have seen the original “Top Gun,” last year’s “Top Gun: Maverick” sequel is both familiar and a welcome and pleasantly mature incarnation. Superstar Tom Cruise (Pete "Maverick" Mitchell) appears ageless, even if the rest of his world does not, and he remains compelling in his role as a charismatic and brave naval aviator who likes to buck the system.

And while all things lead back to Top Gun School in California, this time around Maverick is the instructor and not the student. If there are ghosts of the original film hanging on the walls in old photographs, adoringly memorialized by the film, there are also ghosts haunting Maverick as he searches for atonement for past and current failures.
Maverick has been ordered to take a ragtag collection of top pilots and turn them into a team in order to take on a treacherous mission – an assignment some of his charges probably won’t return from given the danger. Maverick, who has a history of being a lone wolf pilot, has to convince these other lone wolves to work together with precision within the rules. Through a series flight tests and the iconic beach volleyball game at dusk, rivalries are discarded and a team is born.

AtOn Global Leadership, we spend a good deal of time thinking, writing, teaching, and coaching about the challenges that leaders face and the skills that make great leadership. Strong leaders often possess powerful gifts of oration, vision, and organizational alignment. These skills comprise important leadership attributes, but they are not enough.
One of the often overlooked skills of leadership is the art of team building, and it is an art. Leaders that excel at team building focus on three key areas that shape the performance of their teams: building team cultures; empathetically developing and guiding their team members; and leading by example.
Building a strong team culture requires that leaders think deeply about the ways in which they can incentivize and reward values and behaviors they envision for their teams. Then effective team builders, through empathy and mindfulness, must take personal interest in the careers and personal lives of the people around them.

Leading by example is where Maverick and the movie excels. Strong leaders relish the opportunity to work closely with their team members, wading deep in the details and striving to produce results. Maverick is given that opportunity to lead the precarious mission, with his team following his lead. Ultimately, we also see the team rescue Maverick – after his sacrificial act for another team member – as they step up to the leadership he has tried to inspire in them.
