### "The Fabelmans" & Authentic Leadership

8 February 2023|Culture, Leadership
This week, we continue our series of pieces asking what we can learn about leadership from the Oscar-nominated Best Picture films by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Like most of you, we are moved by the culture around us, and often we learn from that culture. We decided to take a look at the 10 nominated films and see what insights about leadership we can glean from the characters, themes, or locations. Our next contribution to this series is about The Fabelmans.
The Fablemans: Sacrifice and Authenticity
By Sarah Kellogg
Steven Spielberg’s “The Fabelmans” is the kind of coming-of-age ride that deepens our level of understanding of the Spielberg legacy. It gives us a profoundly personal story about the filmmaker who has been responsible for some of the most honored and remarkable films of the last four decades.
In introducing us to Spielberg surrogate Sam Fabelman (Gabriel LaBelle), we are given a glimpse of the filmmaker before he leaves his adolescence -- all fresh-faced and smitten by the camera. For longtime fans of Spielberg, it is like seeing the headwaters of a long and winding river for the first time.
The film not only sets the stage for Spielberg’s iconic filmmaking vision by introducing us to his parents and sister, it also allows us as viewers to understand the building blocks of his storytelling expertise and how it was shaped by his family and friends.
In "The Fabelmans," Great Uncle Buck (Judd Hirsch) schools his nephew Sam (Gabriel LaBelle) in the costs of true artistic success.

When his Great Uncle Boris (Judd Hirsch) enters the film at minute 47, the movie takes a surprising turn into a kind of frenzied conversation about authenticity and sacrifice. The cantankerous Hirsch recounts his days as a circus lion tamer, laments his distance from his now dead sister (Sam’s grandmother), and then announces an essential fact about striving for creativity and artistry: You cannot succeed at art and do it halfway. Everything must be sacrificed.
“Art will give you crowns in heaven, and laurels on Earth,” he says in the film. “But it will tear your heart out.”
It is a frightening moment in the film. Sam is young, just at the beginning of his creative journey, and his great uncle is laying out the price of success in a powerful way. Few people would be knowledgeable enough to make the statement -- and fewer would share the brutal reality with the youthful Sam. The scene is different from all the others that come before and after because it has a frenzy to it as Uncle Boris zealously imparts this hard-fought wisdom about success. Yet the scene also rings with an breathtaking authenticity.
Individuals who know themselves deeply are able to find the courage to pursue their creative leadership and vision. What is profoundly powerful about embracing the reality of your dream and publicly acknowledging your willingness to sacrifice for it is the direct link between authenticity and success -- a critical factor for leaders.
What this moment also poses for Sam is the question: Are you willing to align your life completely with your passion? It is too early to tell whether he will in the movie, although his film progenitor Spielberg appears to have made his own choice along the way. Only he knows the cost.
For leaders, whether in the arts or business, sometimes the price of success is pain, sacrifice, and regret. But being authentic in following your dream allows for an honesty with yourself, your family, and your friends that may comfort you and them as you face the competing pressures leadership often brings.
