AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy and, in particular, life in China. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. We have written about economic development in China and China’s economic reforms, U.S.-China relations, China’s changing role in the global political economy, and the history and current state of Chinese politics. In this post, OGL’s Doug Guthrie offers insights from his amicus curiae brief for the TikTok appeal before the Supreme Court of the United States (SCOTUS). The justices will hear oral arguments on Friday, Jan. 10, 2025.
Over the last several months, I have gotten involved with the US case against TikTok. The story of the popular app is well known. On April 24, 2024, President Joe Biden signed the bill passed by the US Congress that would require TikTok’s parent company, ByteDance, to sell the app by January 19. If ByteDance fails to sell the app by the deadline, TikTok will officially be banned from the United States. In March of 2024, Representatives Mike Gallagher (R-WI) and Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-IL), Chairman and Ranking Member of the House Select Committee on the Strategic Competition Between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party, introduced the bill, Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act. In announcing this bill, Gallagher said, “America’s foremost adversary has no business controlling a dominant media platform in the United States. TikTok’s time in the United States is over unless it ends its relationship with CCP-controlled ByteDance.”

My own work on companies navigating the complexities of U.S.-China relations goes back many years, and I have worked on both sides of the divide, advising U.S. companies like Apple navigating China and companies like Huawei attempting to navigate the United States. In March of 2024, I had the pleasure of receiving a note from an old friend and colleague from my time at Apple in China. Christine Ying contacted me about engaging in some intellectual collaboration about U.S.-China relations and technology. Christine and I became friends when we were both working for Apple in China. I left Apple in 2019, returned to the United States and joined the Thunderbird School of Global Management. Christine had left Apple shortly after I did. She then joined ByteDance. I thought the proposal for a collaborative project was very interesting, so we began working together.
Then, about a month later, the bill was passed by Congress and signed by Biden. Shortly thereafter, Christine introduced me to TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew, and I began a short dialogue with the TikTok Executive Team to see if I might be able to help. As part of that dialogue, I wrote a brief for the Supreme Court case. The law firm representing TikTok chose not to use the brief – they believed my arguments were too complicated and that their case should focus on freedom of speech arguments. I disagreed, as I think there is much more at stake here than freedom of speech. I believe the case will have implications for U.S.-China trade relations, U.S. companies operating in China, and responsible global capitalism. These arguments are explicated in the draft of my brief below.
____________________________________________________
I.  Introduction
This Amicus Curiae Brief is not about freedom of speech. Other experts will be addressing this important issue. The focus of this Amicus Curiae Brief is (1) empirical evidence versus assumptions about Chinese Government data collection; (2) the ByteDance/TikTok organizational structure; (3) responsible capitalist behavior of the world’s two largest economies; and (4) the potential consequences for some of the most valuable US firms, specifically, Apple (where the author has extensive experience) and Tesla. It is also about China and the United States’ roles in the global political economy and the extent to which the world’s two largest economies are deeply intertwined. If the US Government and this Court has incontrovertible empirical evidence that the Chinese Government is collecting data on US citizens and using those data to force ByteDance/TikTok to create algorithms that influence US citizens, I would support this ban/force-to-divest case. However, based on my research, I do not believe the US Courts have this kind of evidence. I believe, sans empirical evidence, this case poses a serious risk to prominent US corporations and to the US economy.
There are serious risks to the global capitalist system and to the US role in the global economy if we operate on assumptions that are not grounded in empirical evidence. We must be very careful to play a responsible leadership role in the global political economic system. In my opinion, there is no empirical evidence that TikTok is feeding user data to the Chinese Government. TikTok’s parent company, ByteDance has been careful to structure itself to avoid of allegations that are central to this case. If the United States is going to be a nation that operates based on rumor and assumption in regulating market economics, our role in the global capitalist economy will diminish. Currently, US firms embedded in China are at much greater risk than Chinese firms embedded in the US. The TikTok ban will likely cost ByteDance/TikTok tens of billions of dollars. However, if the Chinese Government decides to retaliate and play hardball with companies like Apple, which it did in the early years of President Xi (when I was advising Apple leadership), Tesla, and Walmart, this dynamic will have serious consequences for capital markets and for the US economy, orders of magnitude larger than what ByteDance/TikTok stand to lose. Thus, as noted above, if the Court has access to incontrovertible evidence that data is being passed to the Chinese Government, then the ban may be the correct decision. However, we are skeptical that this is the case, as it simply does not fit with how ByteDance and TikTok are structured. Further, if we are just making these decisions on nationalistic assumptions, we can expect serious countermeasures and consequences for some of America’s most valuable and innovative firms, which are deeply embedded in and dependent upon China. Thus, this decision, if not based on hard empirical evidence, will have significant consequences for the United States economy and diminishing the United States’ role in the geopolitical capitalist system.
II.  Responsible Global Capitalism
This is an important time for global capitalism and for US-China relations. The world’s two largest economies are deeply intertwined and interdependent. The United States is more dependent on China than most citizens and government officials realize. Views may differ on whether we should be as dependent as we are on the world’s largest Communist Polity and the world’s second largest economy; nevertheless, we are deeply dependent on China, home of the world’s most sophisticated and innovative manufacturing supply chain. This has been a process that has been underway since 1979 and China’s economic opening under Deng Xiaoping.
Since that time, China has built the world’s most sophisticated manufacturing supply chains, and since that time, companies like Apple, Tesla, and Walmart (the single largest exporter from China to the United States) have become fundamentally dependent on China. The idea that we can simply delink from China and produce goods like iPhones and electric batteries elsewhere is simply false. It could be done, but it would take two decades to build manufacturing supply chains in India that would rival those in China. And it will take decades for these companies to build the complex manufacturing supply chains outside of China that would allow them to return to their current levels of profitability and innovation. So, the idea that US firms can simply walk away from China is just uninformed and false. We need to think carefully about the risk we are putting our own firms in if we begin to randomly, based on assumptions and no empirical evidence, make decisions about excluding Chinese firms from the US market.
The assumption guiding this case is that the Chinese Government is engaged in “covert” gathering of data on US citizens and using algorithms to influence the US population against our own government and society. As noted in TIKTOK INC. AND BYTEDANCE LTD., the D.C. Circuit “held that Congress could ban Applicants’ operation of TikTok based on the risk of ‘covert’ manipulation of content by China. App. 54a. But as in all strict-scrutiny cases, the Government bears the burden of proof. And here, neither Congress, the Government, nor the D.C. Circuit identified any evidentiary basis to declare that the ‘covert’ nature of any such risk could not be remedied through an express disclosure.”
This “assumption” of the Chinese Government engagement in “covert” gathering of data is the argument many experts supportive of the ban are making. This is an approach to political analysis based on political science’srational choice theory, not based in empirical evidence. The argument is that China is in an adversarial relationship with the US, and we can rationally assume that the Chinese Government is capturing TikTok data and using it to influence US society. Now, if we do have clear empirical evidence to this effect, it may be responsible to proceed with the TikTok ban. However, several experts, myself included, are highly skeptical that we actually have this empirical data. If we proceed with legally regulating global capitalism based on assumptions and rumors, we place the entire system of global market economics at risk. If we are going to be responsible capitalist partners with the world’s second largest economy, we must make decisions based on hard empirical evidence.
III.  ByteDance Ownership and Organizational Structure, Including Guards Against Flow of Data to the Chinese Government
ByteDance is an Internet technology company incorporated in the Cayman Islands. Founded in 2012, it is well-known and widely reported that ByteDance is 60% owned by international institutional investors, including the Carlyle Group, Susquehanna International Group, Sequoia Capital, General Atlantic. Founders and private (non-state) Chinese investors own 20% of the company; employees own the remaining 20%. Some critics point to the fact that ByteDance has received a “Golden Shares Investment,” which allows the Chinese Government owns probably 1% of the Chinese shares. However, and this is important, the Chinese Government own 1% of Douyin, TikTok’s Chinese counterpart;the Chinese Government does not own any shares of TikTok. My research confirms that the founders made these decisions purposely. As a subsidiary of ByteDance, TikTok is incorporated in the Cayman Islands, with corporate offices in Singapore and Los Angeles. Despite the fact that the founders are Chinese citizens, these businesspeople have worked hard to define an organizational structure that is largely delinked from the Chinese government. Itisthe case that the founders opted for the Golden Shares Investment (a system set in place in 2013), which allows the Chinese Government to purchase a small number of shares (usually 1%) to have observation into the company. As part of this deal, Chinese Communist Official, Wu Shugang (a former member of the Ministry of Propaganda), was appointed to a seat on the board. Now, skeptics of the system, will argue that one seat on the ByteDance Board means that the Chinese Government is controlling ByteDance and therefore has access to TikTok data. Our research (on this case), experience (with other cases), and expertise simply does not support this supposition.
IV.  Implications of a TikTok Ban for Firms and the US Economy: The Cases of Apple and Tesla
If we are going to make decisions about Chinese corporations operating in the United States based on assumptions about the Chinese Government control of these companies, we need to very clear empirical evidence about the bases of these assumptions. If the Courtdoeshave incontrovertible empirical evidence of the Chinese Government’s access to data, perhaps the Court should proceed with the ban. However, if we do not have clear, incontrovertible empirical evidence, we can expect retaliation for US corporations operating in China. And we, the United States, are at much greater risk in this dyadic economic relationship than China. We need to think carefully about these cases.
Leading US companies are heavily dependent on China for production of many products that are exported back to the United States and around the world. In my research and advisory experience, the imbalance of the dependence, and the extent to which the United States economy is at great risk in a trade war with the world’s second largest economy, is underestimated and misunderstood by many in the US citizenry and polity. The profitability of many US companies is fundamentally tied to their Chinese production processes. Inasmuch as the strength of the US economy is largely tied to the innovation and performance of technological powerhouses such as Apple, Tesla, and Walmart, those companies cannot produce their products at scale and profitability without the manufacturing supply chain that exists only in China.
So why is China so important for companies like Apple and Tesla? For these companies, the Chinese market is indeed important (for each of these companies, China is their second largest market behind the United States for their products). But access to the Chinese market is secondary; the real issue is access to the Chinese manufacturing supply chain. Other observers assume that China’s importance lies in the deep cheap labor pool that resides there. However, the situation is much more complex than the presence of a large low-cost labor force. It is about China’s superior manufacturing supply chain, a system that cannot be reproduced in other countries by Foxconn simply building a final assembly factory there (e.g., Chennai, India).
Apple controls about 30% of the smartphone market in the world (in other words, of all of the individuals in the world using smartphones, one-third are using iPhones); however, about 90% of the profits in this market flow to Apple. The answer to the puzzle is China. China – and Apple’s access to the manufacturing supply chain in China – is the reason Apple is one of the five most profitable company in the world.
Apple entered China in 2001 under the guidance of then Chief Operating Officer, Tim Cook. Today, Apple works with over 1,600 suppliers in China, suppliers that build components, assemble modules, and conduct final assembly. The company is able to engage with each of these suppliers, force them to compete against each other for Apple business, which drives production prices down. The benefit to the Chinese suppliers is that they learn efficient supply chain management from Apple’s operations engineers, who work closely with them throughout the process. These suppliers then turn around and charge much higher prices to Apple’s competitors – Huawei, Samsung, Ericsson, Xiaomi, Oppo, Vivo, etc. Apple eschewed the standard business model of the time – the Joint Venture – and instead focused on building partnerships and teaching efficient operations and production to many different suppliers.  Chinese suppliers are willing to work with Apple for near-zero margins in the profit column, as they then carry that tacit knowledge to their work with the rest of the industry. It is a great deal for the Chinese suppliers, as they carry forward the building of the most sophisticated and efficient industrial clusters in the world around a given set of components and modules. And it is a great deal for Apple, which has paid off, making Apple among the most profitable and most valuable companies in the world. This is a deep partnership between Apple and the Chinese economy.
Tesla’s case is similar to Apple’s, though the risk for Tesla is perhaps even more extreme. China has been vigorously promoting the use of new energy vehicles in recent years. It is the general trend for vehicles to shift from ICE to NEV. In recent years, China has become the world's largest automobile market and NEV market in a high growth of 30% - 50% every year. Shanghai gave the most favorable land price. Tesla meanwhile was also struggling to find its own foothold.
Tesla entered China in 2019, with great fanfare and a giga-factory in Shanghai’s Lingang Free Trade Zone. Tesla got a low favorable interest rate, as low as 3.9%, which has made many domestic enterprises envious. China Merchants Bank provided Tesla with a large loan of 5 billion yuan. Tesla was allowed to enter China as a Wholly Owned Foreign Enterprise (WOFE) in an industry where Chinese-Foreign Equity Joint Ventures are the standard model for operation. Tesla was allowed to proceed with its model China’s manufacturing supply chain in this important market segment.
At present, Shanghai Tesla has hundreds of suppliers in China. The supplied components include batteries and connectors, PCB and FPC (flexible circuits), various sensors, heat dissipation components, metallurgical process, wire harness, charging pile, rare earth materials, and gearbox. Since Tesla entered China’s new energy vehicle market, the whole pattern of China's auto market has been disrupted and reshaped. The parts localization effort has formed a strong supply chain and value chain around Tesla.
The reason Tesla’s risk is even greater than Apple’s is that Tesla’s tie to China is literally built into the foundations of its two large factories. Even while the Tesla has maintained special status with the ownership structure of its China factories, the company is not going anywhere. Apple, on the other hand, can do a lot of handwaving – and it is just that, handwaving – about diversifying production across East and Southeast Asia, and if the company wanted to do that, it could. It would just no longer be the most profitable company in the world. In the end, both companies – alongside many others – are married to China.
In this Amicus Curiae Brief, I have argued that: (1) Responsible global capitalism demands that we make decisions not based on assumptions and rumors but instead on clear empirical evidence about practices and behaviors of which we are concerned. In my own research, which includes interviews with key players involved in the decision making processes, I have not found any evidence that the Chinese Government is gathering data from ByteDance/TikTok nor that the Chinese Government is shaping algorithms to influence US citizens’ perceptions of US society. Without strong, empirical evidence related to these issues, we need to be very careful about making decisions about access to the US market. (2) ByteDance/TikTok have taken strong, preemptive measures in its ownership and organizational structure to ensure that the company is largely independent of influence from the Chinese Government. If we go down this road, based largely on fear and assumption, we will damage the US position in the Global Capitalist Political Economy. (3) Our own companies and economy are at significant risk in this dynamic. Leading US corporations like Apple, Tesla, and Walmart (and many others) are at serious risk of retaliation, and these companies are at a much higher level of dependence on China than Chinese companies are dependent on the United States. So, if there is clear, empirical evidence that the Chinese Government has access to data and is manipulating those data, perhaps a ban or required sale of TikTok to another entity is warranted. But, without such evidence, we are inviting retaliation and a growing trade war.
