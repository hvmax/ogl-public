On Global Leadership’s regular feature OGL Real Time presents our up-to-the-minute insights on current news and events. We hope these breaking news insights from our OGL team members will help illuminate the events of the day and provide the depth needed to understand global political, economic, and cultural transitions and transformations. In this post, we reflect on the ongoing debate about U.S. tariffs on goods from China, Canada and Mexico, examining the impact of these tariffs and their wider meaning.
Long before he became President Trump...again, candidate Trump was touting tariffs as a tax on Chinese companies and, therefore, a tax on China. He suggested a financial windfall would come to the U.S. for making Chinese goods more expensive and the tariffs would re-balance U.S.-China trade while also giving the U.S. a cudgel to better negotiate on drug and immigration policies.
Trump followed through on his tariff promise this past week, imposing additional tariffs not only on China (10% on top of the 25% that already exists) but also on the United States' neighbors and favored trading partners, Canada and Mexico (25% a piece).
We have written negatively about the utility of tariffs as a trade or diplomatic strategy previously (see, e.g.,here,hereandhere). But the president’s affinity for tariffs, referring to "tariff" as the "most beautiful word in the dictionary," overrides the multiple sensible argumentsagainstexpanding or extending them to China, Mexico or Canada. For more insight into these new tariffs and their impact, we deliver our latest Real Time.
Were you surprised by the fact the president adopted a 25% tariff on goods from Mexico and Canada?
Yes, the tariff move with Canada and Mexico did surprise us. It was clear from the pre-election rhetoric that China was going to be targeted, but we did not foresee Canada and Mexico being targeted also. Mexico has recently surpassed China as the U.S.’s largest trading partner – due in part to Trump’s 2018 China tariffs, so we assumed that the new administration would be trying to build a trading partnership with the North and Central American economies, U.S.-Canada-Mexico. The idea that we are now in a trade war with our two largest trading partners (Mexico and China) and our largest source of natural resources, energy, and steel (Canada) seems illogical.
President Trump has already delayed the Mexican and Canadian tariffs by 30 days due to favorable negotiations with the leaders from those nations. Did these tariffs turn out to be the best tool to conquer our biggest trade competitors?
Trump always wants to show himself as a great negotiator, and he quickly declared victory when both Mexico and Canada appeared to make concessions to Trump. Unfortunately, a closer reading shows that neither country truly buckled under the pressure, and it was instead Trump who backed down after Wall Street and financial gurus had a bad reaction to the tariffs.
Trump did have calls with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, and both countries agreed to implement measures to address immigration and drug issues. Mexico committed to deploying 10,000 National Guard troops to its northern border, while Canada appointed a "fentanyl czar" and enhanced border security initiatives.But these actions were largely extensions of existing efforts.More importantly, the concessions could have been achieved through traditional diplomatic channels rather than through tariff threats.
Traditionally, tariffs are used for what purpose?
The core concept behind tariffs is that a given nation-state (in this case, the United States) poses a tariff to raise the price of an imported product. If the imported product price rises, local citizens may then purchase a locally manufactured product, and thus support and increase production in the local economy (i.e., creating jobs in the local economy). So, for example, if light-industry goods are targeted, then the price of t-shirts will go up by 25% and people will buy t-shirts made in the U.S. (and thus support and create more American jobs).
The problem with this logic today is that these manufacturing supply chains do not exist in the United States any longer. If Trump thinks iPhones can be made in the U.S., he simply doesn’t understand the complex manufacturing supply chains upon which iPhone production relies in China. The manufacturing supply chain simply does not exist here, and it would take decades to build. Raising the prices of iPhones imported from China by 25% CANNOT induce people to buy a U.S.-produced product. That option simply does not exist, so the only option is for consumers to pay 25% more for the product. Right now, the classical logic behind tariffs is broken. Tariffs have become a very blunt instrument for a very complex manufacturing and global trade sets of problems.
Is President Trump’s use of tariffs to address drug and immigration issues, rather than trade concerns, an innovative or misguided attempt to press these countries to achieve a particular end goal?
The use of tariffs for these issues is ridiculous. We are strong believers in the merging of global trade and international negotiation and diplomacy. The idea that you will just induce tariffs to force important trading partners like Mexico and Canada to the table seems like immature diplomacy. It may be the case that Trump will get some of what he wants, and the U.S. will still look like the global economic superpower forcing the key partners to kowtow to its needs. We think, however, that this is a terrible way to build global trade partnerships with key allies. Diplomacy, diplomacy, diplomacy wins here.
Both Canada and Mexico say our countries are long-time allies. How do you think this situation might impact our diplomatic relationship with each country?
There are two levels to the answer to this question. Initially, this looked like a very toxic way of treating our longtime allies, neighbors, and trading partners. It might be one approach to delink from our interdependence with China, who many in Congress and the new administration view as an adversary. However, the rash move with respect to Canada and Mexico seem to have a negative impact on our diplomatic relations with our two allies.
Levying tariffs on Mexico and Canada—key neighbors and allies—can be counterproductive for economic, geopolitical, and strategic reasons. All three nations are deeply integrated through United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement or the USMCA (formerly NAFTA). Many industries, such as automotive, agriculture, and electronics, rely on cross-border supply chains. Tariffs will increase costs for manufacturers, leading to higher prices for consumers and reduced competitiveness.
Mexico and Canada are essential partners in regional security, counterterrorism, and economic stability. Tariffs create tensions that could reduce cooperation on border security, migration, and drug trafficking. They also weaken the strong North American trade bloc, which is crucial for competing with China and the European Union.
Most significantly, imposing tariffs on Mexico and Canada signals a level of unreliability in U.S. trade policies. This could push Mexico and Canada to strengthen ties with other global trade partners, diluting U.S. influence.
Are there hidden risks to raising tariffs on China, Mexico, and Canada at this time?
There are risks in an escalating and protracted trade war with China, Mexico, and Canada. For example, Apple, one of the world’s most profitable companies, is deeply embedded in China, having relationships with over 1,500 Chinese suppliers. Tesla, with its Shanghai gigafactory, is also embedded in and dependent on China. Walmart is the single largest exporter from China to the United States. If China chose to make business difficult for these important American companies, it could easily do so. We cannot be blind to the fact that U.S. companies have much at stake in global trade wars, and that the likely losers from these risks are U.S. consumers. It is our view that President Trump should tread very carefully on escalating a protracted trade war with our largest and most important trading partners.
