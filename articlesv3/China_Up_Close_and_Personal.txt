Here atOn Global Leadership, we seek to bring a political economic lens to issues of the day with a boots-on-the-ground perspective of how an issue is actually playing out in China. In this post, one of our thought leaders, Chris Gao (Principal at Xanadu Enterprises), shares with us details from his WeChat feed and daily life, giving us an intimate view of how the middle class people in China feel about coming out of isolation, the changes in their own economy and their work, and the world’s reaction to the coronavirus pandemic.
After the outbreak of COVID–19, and perhaps because of work from home (WFH) and the slowdown of global business activities, my once-tepid WeChat moments have become much livelier. An old classmate of mine who has been depressed in the past six months now speaks almost every day. One of my ex-colleagues is even more active, very often there are more than a hundred messages within an hour. My WeChat moments are basically a hodgepodge of everything these days. I decided to select some comments related to the pandemic and globalization, illustrating again another personal link to these hard times.
Globalization has brought the world closer together. However, if something goes wrong with one node, chain reactions will follow. “L” was my classmate at university. She now lives in Houston, Texas, and she is working in the oil industry. “L” wrote this on March 16: “My Norwegian colleague's friend has tested corona positive, caused my supplier in Vietnam to shut down. I have to report project delay because of force majeure to my Singapore customer in America. The world is as close as a sneeze’s distance…”
Although the pandemic is under control in China and lives of people are gradually recovering, it is undeniable that the pandemic has caused huge damage to the Chinese economy. “B” is in deep anxiety, her US company has made the decision to close their factory in China and shift production to Southeast Asia. “B” said: “This year, I estimate there will be no more difficulty in recruiting migrant workers, a lot of foreign trade-related companies will go bankrupt. Laugh, those who think it's irrelevant as if it's some kind of a joke. Only till when the price of food goes up will you guys feel the impact.”
“O” has held management positions in Fortune 500 companies in China and US. He hopes to resume work as quickly as possible, the reason is simple: “We can’t bear if it lasts long.“ The usually forward-looking “O” pessimistic: “Lock-down and cut-off borders will be common in 2020.”
Some people are still optimistic. My alumni friend “Y”, who has been in the medical equipment industry, thinks this way: “To transfer Industry to other countries has a high cost. As the pandemic continues to ferment, the global supply chain has been interrupted on a large scale. The advantage of China's complete industry sectors and supply chain will show the advantage.”
“J” is a global sourcing veteran, and he now works for a top American retailer. Being on the frontline , “J” holds similar opinion as “Y”: “[My factories in) Southeast Asia are in danger, a lot of production capacity will move back to China this year.”
“C”, who is in charge of quality control at a buying office of a UK retailer, echoes “J”: “Suppliers in India have stopped production, and we had a meeting to see which products China can support because other places have all given up.”
Of course, if you think activities in the real world can change the mindset of politicians, you are too young too simple. On April 11, a face kept showing up in WeChat and Weibo:  Larry Kudlow, director of the US National Economic Council, suggested US government pay 100 percent the moving costs of every American company that wants to leave China. “I would say, 100 percent immediate expensing across the board for plant, equipment, intellectual property, structures, renovations...”
2. Attitude towards the pandemic
Friends working in multinational companies often reveal how their colleagues in other parts of the world see the pandemic.
“X” is a purchasing manager at a French home appliance company. On March 19, he posted: “Just finished talking with the French, they all work from home, only food stores are opening, the rest are all closed. 1. They are confident, thinking it will recover in a little more than one month. Subconsciously, they think if you can control it in China, they will for sure do better. 2. They don’t need me to send them masks, the mask is only for the sick. 3. UK started control from yesterday, they are confident in UK. Now EU has cut off the border, while still open internally, people won’t go around. Overall, they are optimistic. “
“X” added a new comment on April 11: “France is ranked fourth now. When I contacted my French colleagues, they started to be afraid and scolded their government.”
“J2” works for a US retailer. She posted a message from her Indian colleague on April 2: “Indian Prime Minister did the right thing by locking down the whole country for 21 days even when we just have 400 cases across the whole country. I think it should help us in flattening the curve. We are under lockdown till 15th April and working from home.”
“P” is the HR head of a European auto company. She spoke very highly of her colleagues in Europe for their support to China when the outbreak started. Her company provided every associate in the Wuhan branch 20 N95 masks. The main job for “P” is to attend one meeting after another, including conference calls with colleagues at headquarters and in other branches. As early as the beginning of March, she predicted that Germany and Austria would be fine, while Italy, France, Spain, and America will be in trouble. Her logic is that countries that emphasize collectivism and with obedient people will outperform countries that pursue individualism.
It seems that “P’s” colleagues have a common enemy. “Forgot to say, they still have time to laugh at the Russians. Why does Russia have such a small infection number? Oh, just like checking the quality, there is no quality problem if you don’t inspect."
They also have a same friend – toilet paper. After seeing a message on panic buying of toilet paper in Japan, “P” added: “Today, I joked on toilet paper with our HRs in France, Italy, Germany and Austria. But I also got a big bag of toilet paper after we talked about it last time.” I can see the smile on her lips as she types.
“C” commented on his colleagues in mid-March: “Our Hong Kong office was closed last week, all WFH. But those foreigners seem to continue what they have been doing, exercise, dine together, etc. No worries.”
“Everyone should wear masks in COVID-19 crisis,” said Cambridge researchers on April 10. No matter how much money is spent on this research now, the feeling is we wish it would have come out two months earlier. The viewpoint and acceptance on masks reflect the attitudes of different countries toward COVID-19.
“M” was my classmate from middle school. She works in the Shanghai branch of a Swiss chemical giant. In normal days, “M” spends half of her time in business trips to Southeast Asia. She posted this message on March 29: “Most of them underrated (COVID-19) in the beginning. Listening to their reaction, we were a little worried, but we also respected their culture and their own decisions. Singaporeans told me long ago that they don't wear masks if they are not sick. The weather there is hot and it will be fine. But next week, the school in Singapore will start online classes. Indonesian said that they stay at home and only go out occasionally so they don’t need masks. Thai people said that it will be no use to mail masks to them as the package will be confiscated by the government for requisition any way. Indians said thank you, but we are still manageable. Vietnamese don’t need either. I keep having con-call meetings with the Italians (Milan, Lombardy). I offered (masks) in the beginning and they answered no, so I am shy to ask again, until last Monday they asked if I can send some masks to them?”
“If masks can protect doctors so naturally, it can protect ordinary people as well. Why are foreigners so resistant to masks?” I am deeply touched by the exclamation of “X”.
For almost two weeks, masks have been a hot topic, from supplier base to quality standards to export regulations, as well as the negative feedbacks overseas. Though it appears simple, the mask is actually much more complicated than one would imagine, especially the N95 mask. One simple advice from a mask wearer: quality, quality, quality.
4. A Special Project
For WFH reasons, “X” said he gained 10 pounds in 20 days. Instead of driving, now he takes the subway and rides a shared bicycle to the office every day. In early April, “X” received an urgent order from his headquarters, as the French government asked his company to make ventilators, he is now responsible for finding specific ventilator parts in China. Under huge pressure, “X” complained: “It is not difficult to find a factory to develop and make a shipment in three months. The Chinese factories are capable. The challenge is to make shipment within one month.“
“As a matter of fact, making a ventilator is not as difficult as making jet fighters or cars. What we are short of is ‘time’.” If we had prepared earlier, things would be turned out en masse. “T” said that the risk is very small and it will disappear shortly. “The first-tier factories are in full capacity, and the second-tier factories are fully occupied as well. You can only work with a third-tier factory that picks you.”
Griping aside, the task is always to be fulfilled—and it is a very special one. Now, the 90-day project in normal days will be completed within 45 days. Shipments can be made in May.
The pandemic has cut off transportation and cut off production, but it can’t cut off love, cut off care. On February 9, “T”, our company's service provider in Vietnam, posted below message on WeChat. “Our hearts are always together, our love will not be isolated, Wuhan Jiayou, Wuhan, keep going.”
When we entered 2020, a popular quote in WeChat was, “2020 will be the best year in the next decade.” COVID-19 is indeed the biggest crisis I have ever experienced in my life; the world will never be the same again. But I still believe that human hearts will be connected, and human hands will be held together because we only have one earth. May the world return to peace and rebirth. STAY STRONG, FORZA EARTH.
