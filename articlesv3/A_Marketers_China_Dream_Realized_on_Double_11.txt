### A Marketers’ China Dream Realized on Double 11

10 January 2020|China
Consider this: Tmall and Taobao reached 100 billion RMB, over 1.4 billion USD in sales in a day on Singles Day 2019. On Tmall, NIKE surpassed 1 million RMB in sales in less than 2 minutes; Apple beat last year’s sales—by 7 times—within 10 minutes.
Whether you call it Singles Day, Double 11, or 11.11, it is a shopping spree like nothing the world has ever seen. Started in 2009 by Alibaba on its Tmall online platform, partly as a promotional stunt and partly in response to the call by the Chinese government think tanks’ recommendation that China should evolve into a consumer economy, Double 11 has grown to be the largest group buy in the world.
Several weeks before, large 11.11 signs started to appear in metro stations in creative designs, radios blared in breathless excitement detailing the heavenly deals to be had, and over lunch colleagues were discussing their dream items. The popularity of Double 11 is that it appeals to all age groups, any gender, rural and urban dwellers, and researchers and street cleaners. It’s a national obsession.
Not only major name brands made out that day. Whimsical Blindbox, which offers up mysterious boxes of various sizes containing collectibles and memorabilia improbably, beat its own expectations. An online version of the US TV showLet’s Make a Deal, where the average price per item is 70RMB (10USD), was massively successful. One seller on Blindbox cleared all inventory of 55,000 units in the first 9 seconds.
The efficiency of the systems that support the shopping spree is impressive. Considering the first couple of years saw the Internet crash from the weight of sales, the Double 11 has evolved to a highly sophisticated system. Mobile financial payments made a definitive impact. The Peoples Bank of China reported that in the 24 hours of Double 11, 1.779 billion transactions were processed by Unionpay and Nets Union, an increase of 35 percent and 162 percent respectively. A total of 1,482 billion yuan was exchanged. Or to put it another way, it’s as though the entire population of China went out and spent 1000RMB in one day. All new entrants to the China market will at some point wistfully say that if everyone in China would only buy one of my widgets all the hassles would be worth the effort. On Double 11 the dream is realized.
Even farther down the logistics chain, the achievement was profound. Courier delivery mopeds scurried around the streets overladen with boxes for shoppers who just made purchases online less than 24 hours before. And the vast majority is shipping free of charge or at an extremely low cost. Within 48 hours the bulk of the purchases reached their destinations. The shopping frenzy has faded as the merchants tallied up the totals and satisfied shoppers retreated back into their daily lives—all enjoying the fruits of a few minutes online.
This year new and innovative tools to reach online eyeballs were a large part of the appeal. Live video sales hawking flash discounts engaged the market. Alibaba provided an online “war room” for sellers to access real-time video broadcast channels. Food promoters communicated their commitment to helping the farmer with value-driven messaging such as “help the farmers and support the poor” to appeal to the millennial shoppers. Next year’s event will likely showcase ever newer tactics and tools to grow the market.
After a decade of expanding platforms and products, as well as more and more shoppers joining the fray, global manufacturers must factor Double 11 into their operations. A China marketing and sales strategy will be incomplete without including Singles Day. Production timelines, inventory levels, promotional content, and networks must be aligned for November 11. Back office and warehouse lifecycles must be adjusted as well. Companies must act seamlessly and collectively in today’s fast-paced consumer world to respond to the Double 11. Preparation will be critical to success in the future as Singles Day becomes even more enshrined in China’s economy, culture, and psyche. See ya next year!
