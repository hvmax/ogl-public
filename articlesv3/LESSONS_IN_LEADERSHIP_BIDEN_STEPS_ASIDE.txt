### LESSONS IN LEADERSHIP: BIDEN STEPS ASIDE

23 July 2024|Creative Leadership, Everyday Leadership, Leadership
At On Global Leadership, we focus on two issues that are front and center today. First, there is the question of how political and economic events in this country and around the world impact U.S.-China relations. Second, there are the questions that arise when we see good and bad leadership examples in our daily lives. Given our decades-long experience in the leadership field, we felt it was important to examine President Biden’s decision to withdraw from the 2024 presidential race and what it tells us about leadership in America today, and what it says about the importance of individual leaders choosing their organizations over themselves.
By David Slocum and Doug Guthrie
Joseph Biden’s decision not to continue as the Democratic Party candidate for the U.S. presidency has further roiled an already tumultuous 2024 American election season. On July 21, he posted a letter to social media indicating he would “stand down” from seeking re-election and “focus solely” on fulfilling his duties as president for the remaining six months of his current term. The announcement was the culmination of weeks of speculation about, and pressure from many to consider, withdrawing from the election race following his disastrous performance in the Democratic presidential debate with Donald Trump on June 27.
"Standing down" is an anodyne way to characterize the decision. Much was made leading up to the debate, and particularly following it, about the decline of the president’s abilities due to his age. This personal attention was sometimes couched in wider discussions, like that in a podcast series atThe Economist, about the American gerontocracy and, specifically, the generation of leaders (including Biden) born in the 1940s who have resisted giving up their political positions and power.
Yet any general or generational consideration about the decline of powerful senior leaders has proven no less awkward than similar discussions in families about the physical and cognitive decline of elders and how to manage resulting issues like their continuing to be able to drive. References to King Lear in coverage of Biden’s condition point both to the difficulty of individual leaders choosing (or not) to leave positions they’ve long served in or the challenge of others to determine the factors that should be used to consider their fitness or capacity to continue such service.
For leaders of any age, Biden’s decision contains another more far-reaching lesson. While advancing age presents its own challenges, a related complication confronts everyone who shapes their leadership self-understanding and public persona with a commitment to follow through and carry on regardless of conditions or critics. For many leaders, perseverance and stick-to-it-iveness are often precisely what differentiates those who are successful from those who aren’t. This attitude is central to our ways of thinking about leadership success in sports (legendary U.S. football coach Vince Lombardi said, “Winners never quit and quitters never win.”) and business (hotel magnate Conrad Hilton said, “Successful men and women keep moving. They make mistakes, but they don’t quit.”). Being able to diverge from the path we have been on – in sports, business, relationships, and life – is enormously fraught and difficult.
For some, "standing down" carries a military connotation which may lend a more deliberate and honorable cast to the decision. Yet even with this careful wording, many still don’t easily differentiate standing down for an important cause or purpose from dropping out or quitting as a sign of personal failure or weakness. Before Biden announced his decision, many news reports claimed that he prided himself, after five decades of public service and personal tragedy, on “always getting up when you’re knocked down” – in other words, not giving up or quitting.
Especially in the glare of politics or business, making the decision to stand down “in the best interest of [the] party and the country” is a courageous and magnanimous act. However, it is an act that requires all of us to understand its significance: that great leadership sometimes means subtracting rather than adding (as design scholar Leidy Klotz has written), learning to say no (as Apple icon Steve Jobs emphasized), and prioritizing others’ well-being over one’s own (like Gandhi, in his commitment to ‘Sarvodaya’, or the ‘upliftment of all”).
A Critical Juncture in U.S. History
The wave of concern that Biden wasn't up to the moment has dominated his presidential campaign and his administration in the last few weeks. It was becoming well-founded for fearful Democrats. His poor performance in the debate and his follow-up interviews suggested that he no longer was able to bring the rigor necessary to the job.
Democrats worried, for good reason given the polls, that a failed Biden campaign would open the doors to a second President Trump term, one marked by instability in the U.S. economy and global security. Trump and his running mate, Sen. J.D. Vance of Ohio, have shown a particular disdain for governing the "real" United States. They have signaled -- both quietly and with a bullhorn -- their eagerness to follow trickle-down economics that would result in another great transfer of income from the working class to the wealthy corporate elite, as happened in Trump's first term.
As we have written previously (here), “shareholder capitalism and trickle-down economic theory have run wild in the United States, and that run has largely benefited the wealthy and hurt the middle- and working-classes of American society. There is a reason that, from 1970 to 2020, the middle class share of aggregate income fell from 62% to 43% while the aggregate income of upper income households grew from 29% to 48% over the same period, according to Pew. This is also the reason that the top 1% of US families control an astounding 38.5% of America’s wealth, the highest ratio of anywhere in the world. Crony capitalism indeed.”  A Harris-led ticket will be more helpful for working and middle class Americans.
With respect to foreign policy and, in particular U.S.-China relations, a Trump-Vance administration will take the country to very disturbing places. We have written about the very negative economics of Trump’s global trade policies (here). We have also written about the overtly hawkish attitude Vance brings toward China (here). We view a Trump-Vance administration as a danger to global balance security. Thus, in the area of global affairs and, in particular, U.S.-China relations, we consider a Harris-led ticket as helpful for the security and stability of the world.
We have built our careers teaching about leadership, and we each have different areas upon which we focus. We have researched and explored how leaders have a sophisticated way of understanding the complex systems in which they and their organizations operate. And we have written and taught the VAMI leadership model – Vision, Alignment, Motivation and Introspection. How well does a leader understand the vision for his or her organization? Can leaders build an organization that is aligned with that vision? How does the leader motivate people around him or her in achieving vision and alignment? And how well does the leader see him or herself? How honest with themselves are they?
These key questions most often boil down to the leader separating his or her own ego and personal purpose to do what is in the best interest of the organization he or she is leading. Putting the Interests of the organization first is not easy, even for talented and committed leaders.
Whatever we may think of Joseph Biden’s politics, we should appreciate both his individual decision to face his own mortalityandhis public action to withdraw from the presidential race. His action, in particular, asks us to remember leadership is finally about enabling the greater good beyond ourselves. And sometimes, for each of us, the most prudent and courageous action is to stand down, step away and move on.
