On Global Leadership's feature, OGL Real Time, presents our up-to-the-minute insights on current news and events. We hope these breaking news insights from our OGL team members will help illuminate the events of the day and provide the depth needed to understand global political, economic and cultural transitions and transformations. This post explores whether the decision by Didi Chuxing, the $39 billion ride-hailing company, to delist its shares from the New York Stock Exchange is the beginning of an exodus from Wall Street, or a one-off case.
Any thoughts on whether we’re going to see a bunch of the other big tech firms that list on the Stock Exchange now delist, such as Alibaba, Baidu, JD, etc.?
It is unlikely that the Didi case is the beginning of a major exodus from U.S. listings. Currently, there are about 250 Chinese firms listed on U.S. exchanges, accounting for more than $2 trillion in valuation. If you define technology under a broad umbrella (including technology, business services, consumer services, and fintech), the vast majority of the Chinese firms listed in the U.S. fall under this umbrella. There are a few notable exceptions like PetroChina, but, largely, the list is mostly comprised by tech companies. President Xi Jinping and the reform-minded clique he leads are smart capitalists. Their primary goal is China’s rise in prominence and influence in the world through economic growth. It is very unlikely they will destroy trillions of dollars in value (even if it could be rebuilt by re-listing companies on a Chinese exchange) in a haphazard fashion. They clearly want to make a few examples here, however. And these examples come at the expense of companies and business leaders that may appear to think they are global and therefore beyond the reach of the Chinese Government (e.g., Didi, Ant/Alibaba). They are striking a balance by disciplining a few players. But I don’t believe this is the beginning of a major exodus. If I had to guess, I would say the Jack Ma/Ant case was about discipline because Ma publicly criticized the Chinese regulatory system, and that criticism cost him (personally) probably about $2 billion. The Didi case was more of a threat of things that *could* happen – if the U.S. wants to fight with China, we have other options (e.g., Hong Kong).
Do you have a sense of whether the U.S. audit rules or the pressures from the Chinese government are more influential here, or is it really a mix of both?
This is not about the audit rules. It is all about pressure from the Chinese government. There are three things going on here. First, China has been laying the groundwork for an economic decoupling from the United States for more than a decade. The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), which was officially launched in 2013, was specifically about China developing a presence that took it away from dependence on its largest trading partner, the U.S. This has been in the works for a long time. Second, U.S.-China relations, which have become much more tense in recent years for many reasons – Trump’s trade war, Xinjiang, Hong Kong, Taiwan – have accelerated the decoupling. China wants to make it clear that it is not dependent on any other country for its continued economic growth. Third, Hong Kong used to be the financial center of Asia. That reputation has been damaged by the rise of Shanghai and Shenzhen but, most importantly, by the political tensions between Hong Kong and Beijing. Beijing would like to signal to the world that Hong Kong can still play that role. Forcing Didi to delist in the U.S. and re-list in Hong Kong sends exactly that signal.
If there is an exodus of Chinese firms from Wall Street, what would that look like in the coming years?
Here again, I don’t foresee an exodus here. Xi’s administration will send messages to Chinese companies and to the world about China’s priorities, but there won’t be an exodus. The Ant example notwithstanding, I think it is very unlikely that the Xi administration is going to destroy value in a rapid or haphazard way. So, no, I don’t think companies like Pinduoduo or Nio are at serious risk. As an aside, TikTok/Bytedance is an interesting case here, and I have wondered about the leadership shake up there in recent months. My guess is that they are trying to be attentive to the climate and careful going forward. With all these things going on, China is still the world’s fastest growing and soon to be largest economy. The Chinese assessment is that U.S. investors would not miss the high-return market voluntarily. People also believe the regulatory requirements can be worked out under a mood of cooperation. Beijing must have a menu list for retaliations for any sanction imposed, but it's an "impact-response”  mechanism. In this light, the Chinese AI firm Sense Time also provides an interesting case of the tit-for-tat economic war that is unfolding. Following the Biden Administration’s decision to blacklist the company — effectively prohibiting American investors from buying shares of the firm, the company has delayed its IPO.
