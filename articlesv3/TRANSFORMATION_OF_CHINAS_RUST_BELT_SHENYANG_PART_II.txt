### TRANSFORMATION OF CHINA’S RUST BELT: SHENYANG, PART II

15 May 2024|China, City Profile, Economic Development, Trade
AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy and, in particular, life in China. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. We have sought to advance a conversation about the U.S.-China relationship, and a deep understanding of local economic development in China. We have written a series about the strategic strength oflocal economic development in China’s 2nd and 3rd tier citiesandentrepreneurship in China today. These case studies are part of a larger project in which we report on the strength of China’s economic development model (e.g.,hereandhere). Our focus in these posts is on the Chinese theory of economic development – what Andrew Walder has called “local governments as industrial firms” – and on examples of local leaders operating in this practice of development. In many ways, these local leaders are the quiet heroes of China’s economic development prowess. This post follows an earlier post in which we began to explore the development of Liaoning Province’s Shenyang, a key site of China’s automobile industry. The case serves as a “negative case analysis,” a case that provides some contrast to the powerful positive examples examined in other cases (e.g.hereandhere).
China’s economy has achieved truly impressive growth over the past 40 years. In 1979, China’s economy stood as small global economy, 1/20th the size of the world’s largest economies – $178 billion compared to $2.6 trillion in the US – with an estimated 800 million people living in abject poverty. Today, China’s stands as the world’s second largest economy, home to the world’s most sophisticated and dynamic manufacturing supply chain and the world’s largest economy when adjusting for Purchasing Power Parity (PPP). The economic transformation has been nothing short of miraculous. Yet, with many challenges along the way, the process has never been simply smooth sailing. Understanding the mechanisms undergirding China’s economic development, its industrial transformation, and the evolution of the state-owned economy are crucial points in this important economic narrative. Shenyang provides a fascinating window onto these dynamics.

Shenyang provides a fascinating window onto these dynamics.a
In earlier posts, we have sketched out the dynamic interaction of national level development goals and local level innovation (see here). “We build on China scholar Andrew Walder’s (1995) concept of “local governments as industrial firms” and Economic Sociologist Neil Fligstein’s political-cultural approach to market building. Bringing the work of these two eminent theorists together, we argue that China’s economic transformation has been so successful because the Chinese government has built a political-cultural approach to market building, where local officials have grown up in a culture of entrepreneurialism and innovation. Local governments are deeply involved in market construction in their local jurisdictions. They are loosely guided by the Central Government’s broad plans, but they are given the freedom and incentives to build their local markets as they see fit. Thus, instead of the empty notion of free market governance put forward in Neoclassical Economic Theory, China’s economy thrives on the frenetic entrepreneurialism of its local governments. Through this architecture of markets, playing out at the local levels across the country, China will be the world’s dominant economy for decades to come.”
“Economic development in China is fundamentally shaped by government guidance and centralized control. This has been true since the beginning of the economic reforms (and during the Communist Era as well). However, while we often think of the Chinese government as the authoritarian, protectionist, centralized party in Beijing, that is only one side of the government. In reality, local governments are the engines driving China’s growth. Indeed, the Chinese government is an extremely decentralized and entrepreneurial system of district and township governments. The mayors of China’s districts, townships, and villages behave like corporate CEOs, focusing on KPIs, pursuing foreign investment, and advancing their own careers through the financial and economic achievements in their districts and townships. But they don’t do it alone – they do it through close coordination with China’s private sector and with foreign investors from abroad. Companies like Tencent, Alibaba, and Huawei, but also Apple, GM, Boeing, and Microsoft have worked closely with these local governments to drive a phenomenon of local state competition. What the Chinese have discovered is that private property is not the cornerstone of capitalism, as economists have long thought – local competition is. Thus, while rapid privatization programs were unleashed on the former Soviet Bloc, China carefully set in place a balance between state control and local state incentives. It then mixed this balance with enough autonomy for local governments to go out and recruit partners from the private sector and abroad. It has allowed China to build the most dynamic manufacturing supply chain in the world. And it has allowed China to quietly become one of the most innovative economies in the world. Through our analyses of cases that range from Tier 1 cities like Shanghai, Hangzhou, and Shenzhen to Tier 2, 3, and 4 cities like Changzhou, Zhenjiang, Nantong, Guiyang, and many others, we analyze how local governments are creating the framework for a new economic landscape in China.”
Part II of our Shenyang analysis, presented here, provides somewhat of a “negative case study,” providing data and insights on a part of China that has been less successful than innovative, fast-growing cities (see, for example,here,here, andhere) that prove the rule.
Northeast China and Shenyang
Northeast China refers to the region consisting of Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang and eastern Inner Mongolia (1). The region is China’s home to important sectors -- heavy industry, energy production and grain production. It is called the “eldest son of PRC (People’s Republic of China).” After the reform, opening up and especially after 2013, the economic gap between the Northeast and other eastern regions had kept widening, and it did not stabilize until 2023. On social media, the Northeast is known as China’s Rust Belt, with an exaggerated claim that “Investment should not go beyond Shanhaiguan.”
As the capital of Liaoning Province and a sub-provincial city, Shenyang is Northeast China’s economic, cultural, financial and commercial center, as well as a major transportation hub. Shenyang is known as：
China’s earliest heavy industry base specialized in equipment manufacturing, nicknamed “the Equipment Department of the PRC”.A city with rich scientific and educational resources, including:
• China’s earliest heavy industry base specialized in equipment manufacturing, nicknamed “the Equipment Department of the PRC”.
• A city with rich scientific and educational resources, including:
--The largest number of colleges and universities in the Northeast
--Shenyang Branch of China Academy of Sciences (CAS) and three CAS research institutes
A famous historical and cultural city in China, with 2,300 years of history and once the capital of the Qing Dynasty.
• A famous historical and cultural city in China, with 2,300 years of history and once the capital of the Qing Dynasty.
The period of China’s planned economy was the heyday of Shenyang and Northeast China’s economy. In 1980, at the beginning of the reform and opening up, Shenyang’s total GDP ranked fifth among cities in China, higher than storied reform-era cities like Guangzhou, Wuhan, and Hangzhou. Since the late 1980s, Shenyang’s economic weight has declined, and from 2021 to 2023, its per capita GDP was lower than the national average (Figure 3).
The period of late of 1990s/2000s was a difficult time for Shenyang and the Northeast. The region was hit hard by market-oriented reforms, when thousands of state-owned factories were shut down or restructured, and millions of workers were laid off and their pensions and benefits slashed or cancelled.
In order to solve the issues of the old industrial bases in Northeast China and boost further development in the region, in 2003, Beijing made the major strategic decision to implement a key development policy, the Revitalization of Northeast China (东北振兴). During the decade from 2003 to 2012, the Northeast developed rapidly, as its economy reached new heights, lightening the unemployment problems caused by the shuttering of state-owned enterprises (SOE). These achievements can be attributed mainly to two forces:
First, Beijing introduced many policies to support the initiative with projects and supporting funding from the center. Within ten years, Shenyang had completed a total of ￥2,807.9 billion in fixed asset investment, which is 102% of the cumulative GDP in the same period, much higher than the national average of 48.1%. These new investments in Shenyang were concentrated in heavy industry projects by SOEs and real estate development projects.It has been a period of accelerated industrialization in China, where energy, raw materials, and equipment manufacturing industries were in a boom cycle, a cycle that was in alignment with the industrial structure of the region.

In hindsight, in this so-called “golden decade”, the average GDP growth rate of Liaoning, Jilin and Heilongjiang after adjustment were 10%, i.e., the national average. Bold pronouncements were made: “The rapid development of Shenyang’s industry in 2005 will go down in history… Shenyang’s industry has completely gotten rid of its wandering and predicament... Shenyang’s industry has finally stood up its backbone!” (2). However, with deeper analysis, we find that statements like these suggest that local officials had become complacent, perhaps operating with cooked data, and largely unaware that the structural problems of the economy were still far from being resolved.
After 2013, China’s economic growth rate had settled from the historic double-digit rate to 6–7%. Chinese government has attempted to rebalance its economy to achieve a “new normal” of slower but more sustainable economic development. Such transformation is in line with economic laws and almost inevitable, but the process has been difficult for a city like Shenyang and, more generally, Northeast China.
Structural Transformation of the Economy
So, why has the economy of Northeast China declined again? In an important document titled “Some opinions on the Comprehensive Revitalization of Old Industrial Bases in Northeast China,” jointly issued by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council, the issue was attributed to “the problem of system and mechanism, the industrial structure and economic structure, and the solution to these problems depends on comprehensively deepening reform in the final analysis.” Since then, local governments in Northeast China have paid more attention to economic restructuring and industrial upgrading. The statistical data of industrial enterprises above designated size is the main source to observe the situation of the industrial economy of the city. Next, we will analyze the changes in Shenyang’s industrial structure after 2016.
Heavy industry is the pillar of Shenyang’s economy. The proportional data (Figure 4) shows that although the number of employed persons and payroll payable decreased slightly, the number of heavy industry enterprises, their assets and operating income have all increased, and in particular, profits have increased substantially. The reason is simple, the contribution of the automotive industry and BMW Brilliance in particular (3). During this period, Shenyang also had other heavy industry products with greater exposure, such as five-axis CNC machine tools (Shenyang Machine Tools), large compressors (Shengu Group), industrial robots (SIASUN), aero engines (Liming Aero), etc., but they could not compete with BMW in terms of sales and profits. In light industries, only the food industry has sales of exceeding ￥100 billion, and its leaders like Wellhope and Toly Bread cannot compare with aforementioned heavy industry giants in reputation, popularity and technical capabilities.
The reform of SOEs has been the main battlefield for generations of leaders of Shenyang to solve the city’s economic puzzles. In a sense, for Shenyang and even the entire Northeast, the economy is all in the hands of SOEs. For a long time, the assets of SOEs in Shenyang accounted for more than 50% of the total assets of industrial enterprises above designated size (Figure 5), while the national average was lower than 40% in the same period.
For many reasons, Shenyang’s private economy is small in number and scale. Among the “Top 500 Private Enterprises in China in 2023,” there is only one from Shenyang (total of three from Liaoning Province), while Zhenjiang City, which ranks in middle in Jiangsu Province, has five on the list. After implementing the strategy of Revitalization of Old Industrial Bases in Northeast China, the government has invested a large amount of money into SOEs to carry out the so-called “strategic reorganization” and “making SOEs bigger and stronger.” Most of the private enterprises in Shenyang’s manufacturing industry are supporting and servicing SOEs.
The year 2022 marks the end of the three-year action plan for SOE reform. In the absence of detailed official disclosure, we infer from the asset data that a significant number of the previous SOEs have implemented shareholding structure reforms, and they or their subsidiaries have withdrawn from the ranks of SOEs in the statistical sense. In this way, it is easy to understand the sharp profit decline of SOEs in 2022 – relatively good state-owned assets are more likely to attract external investments. Of course, the per capita payroll of SOE is much higher than Shenyang’s average and even higher than that of foreign-invested enterprises (Figures 7 and 8).
Some Further Thoughts
When it comes to Shenyang’s economy, the mainstream view is that its industrial structure has not kept up with the trend of China’s industrial evolution after the reform and opening up, because it is dominated by heavy industry and lacks the development of light industry, especially the consumer goods industry. Shenyang’s large state-owned economy is a systemic obstacle to its economic development. If changes were made in these two areas, the revitalization of the city would be as successful as is the case in other coastal regions. The above view also applies to most other parts of the Northeast. We believe that such a judgment oversimplifies the issue and analysis above doesn’t support the argument.
To understand the predicament faced by Shenyang, we must first have an objective understanding of the local endowment and human conditions. Further to the natural and historical reasons such as early industrialization and abundant mineral resources in the surrounding area, there are also some specific contributions to Shenyang’s early success, such as：
Geopolitics – After the founding of PRC, Shenyang became a key area for industrial investment, because of the international situation and its geographical location. Among the “156 Industrial Projects” aided by the former Soviet Union in the 1950s, 56 were in Northeast China, 24 in Liaoning Province, and 7 in Shenyang. These projects set the region on a very different trajectory than the seven coastal provinces from Shandong to Guangxi.Planned economy – After the completion of Soviet aided projects, the products were sold according to the national plan, and the production enterprises did not need to worry about sales. For a long time, Shenyang’s competitive products are mostly in 2B rather than 2C categories. In such environment, employees are more accustomed to being a good executor. Later on, the reason for BMW to locate its production base in Shenyang is basically the same.

Many of the factors that contributed to Shenyang’s success in the planned economy age have become unfavorable conditions after entering the era of market economy. Although the Southeast coastal area lacks natural resources, international resources can make up for such shortcoming. The disadvantages of the Northeast are:
The region is far away from the heart of domestic markets;The cold climate is not attractive to migrant workers to develop labor-intensive industries;l  The deterioration of Sino-Soviet relations has stalled the import of industrial technology, and the tensions on the Korean Peninsula and the uncertainty of Sino-Japanese and Sino-South Korean relations have affected the attraction of foreign investment in Shenyang and the Northeast.

• l  The deterioration of Sino-Soviet relations has stalled the import of industrial technology, and the tensions on the Korean Peninsula and the uncertainty of Sino-Japanese and Sino-South Korean relations have affected the attraction of foreign investment in Shenyang and the Northeast.
The problem with the revitalization plan of Northeast China after 2003 is that the capability of the Northeast was overestimated in many respects, which led to a great deal of work at a stage for recuperation. As a result, people saw some good GDP figures with tremendous investments, but missed the best window to solve the deep-seated problems at a lower cost.
Heavy industry, especially the equipment manufacturing industry, is Shenyang’s strength, but its market size is determined by downstream industries and cannot grow indefinitely. Even if the new growth engine has not yet matured, Shenyang still should also not overdo it to traditional pillar industries.
For further development of Shenyang and Northeast China, we recommend the following:
Local governments should make the creation of a fair business environment their top priority, leaving other matters to the market whenever possible. They need to foster an attitude to “respond to every request otherwise: do not disturb (有求必应、无事不扰)” when servicing the business communities.When measuring economic performance, Beijing and local governments should focus more on per capita indicators rather than total GDP.Enterprises should change the philosophy of “ First become bigger, then become better (先做大，再做好)”, and pay more attention to cash flow and operating efficiency from the early stages of development.The direction of industry structure adjustment should be determined through market mechanism, bearing in mind that an efficient government should still play a active role in the construction of an effective market.The transformation and reform of SOEs cannot just be a superficial process. The key is to truly establish a modern enterprise system and operate according to economic laws.

In the final analysis, the business environment on which economic development depends is not a gift from the government. The administrators should truly change their minds and realize that enterprises and taxpayers are the true body of the market. Only when their vitality is released, will the endogenous power of the local economy grow. This is a problem to be solved by all levels of government in China, a problem particularly urgent for Shenyang and Northeast China.
