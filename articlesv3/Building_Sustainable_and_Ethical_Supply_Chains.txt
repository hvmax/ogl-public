### Building Sustainable and Ethical Supply Chains

(This column was originally published on Forbes.com. It has been updated to reflect additional thoughts.)
In the business world, fiscal imperatives often prevail over values—even the values of social  responsibility and ethical behavior—as corporations strive to mitigate  costs and reduce uncertainty. Nowhere is that drive for certainty and  cost containment more compelling than in the corporate supply chain.
The global marketplace demands that supply chains be nimble and diffuse. Their broad distribution has elevated their significance beyond  the functionality of manufacturing and transport, and they are transformative in the way they remake a corporation and the effect they  have on local economies. An efficient supply chain is responsive to  changing priorities by keeping costs in line, schedules on time and,  more importantly, giving companies the room to scale for growth.
In the 1980s and 1990s, U.S. companies set aside much of their supply  chains for outsourcing. Globalization, technology and the desire for  profit made it possible to manufacture parts in one nation, put them  together in another and sell them in a third. While controversial in  some quarters, outsourcing proved to be expedient and profitable.
This revolution in the supply chain did not diminish the need for  corporate citizenship, however. In fact, it demands citizenship that is  even more robust, capable of encompassing both the parent company and  its many contractors, even if they are on distant shores. The supply  chain cannot be divorced from corporate social responsibility (CSR) concerns about the environment, health and safety.
Envisioning a seamless world of corporate citizenship that extends  beyond U.S. borders is far easier than achieving it. Outsourcing brought  with it a host of new challenges, not the least of which was entirely  different sets of standards with regard to health and safety and  environmental regulation. U.S. corporations that might have been  described as CSR supermen in the United States have found it more  difficult to capture the accolades in their overseas manufacturing  operations.
CSR advocates have always argued that U.S. companies have an ethical  responsibility that isn’t constrained by geographic and political  borders, or even cultural traditions. It has been a sobering enterprise  to put that notion into effect in countries that do not share the United  States’ affinity for regulation and compliance, although it must be  argued that many U.S. companies shifted operations overseas to avoid the  heavy hand of U.S. regulation and the costs that came with it.
The experience of Nike in the 1990s illustrates this quandary  acutely. Like many U.S. corporations that outsource manufacturing, Nike  was driven by a desire to assemble products at a fraction of the cost of  producing them in the United States—indeed Nike was one of the great  innovators in overseas manufacturing. What made Nike particularly  remarkable is that it was one of the first U.S. companies to sever the  connection between the independent contractor manufacturing a product  and the company that contracts the work. Nike insisted that labor  conditions in its contractors’ factories were not its responsibility.  “Nike’s company line on the issue was clear and stubborn: without an  in-house manufacturing facility, the company simply could not be held  responsible for the actions of independent contractors,” wrote Debora L.  Spar in “Hitting the Wall: Nike and International Labor Practices” in theHarvardBusinessReviewin 2002.
Confident in its position, Nike was still sensitive to the potential  public relations nightmare an unrestrained local manufacturer could  wreck on its good name, and it drafted a code of conduct for its  contractors. This code outlined best practices in the areas of safety  standards, environmental regulation and worker insurance, and suppliers  were required to certify that they were following the code and local  regulations.
There was no effort, of course, to determine if contractors complied  with the code, and, eventually, Nike’s factories came under attack for  their workplace practices, including the use of child laborers. Watching  its reputation sullied by stories of abuse, facing a backlash on  college campuses from irate students, Nike began to see its profits dip.  In fiscal year 1998, beset by the Asian currency crisis, oversupply and  weak demand, Nike saw its earnings fall 69 percent and was forced to  lay off workers.
“Nike’s fiscal woes did what hundreds of harsh articles had failed to do: they took some of the bravado out ofPhil Knight,”  wrote Spar, of Nike’s chief executive officer and founder. “In a May  1998 speech to the National Press Club, a humbled Knight admitted that,  ‘the Nike product has become synonymous with slave wages, forced  overtime, and arbitrary abuse.’”
Faced with significant earnings losses, Knight moved to turn around  Nike’s policies on contractors and encouraged monitoring of local  factories. In recent years, Knight has gone beyond monitoring to embrace  a more collaborative approach to reforms, sharing workplace and human  resource best practices.
As Richard M. Locke, Fei Qin and Alberto Brause noted in “Does  Monitoring Improve Labor Standards? Lessons from Nike” in 2007 in theIndustrial & Labor Relations Review,  monitoring alone is not able to accomplish the tasks necessary to  ensure a safe and healthy workplace. They wrote that, “global brands and  labor rights NGOs would do well to complement their current emphasis on  monitoring by providing suppliers technical and organizational  assistance to tackle some of the root causes of their poor working  conditions. Perhaps not all suppliers would be willing to collaborate  with global brands and NGOs on these efforts, but refusals to  collaborate could provide global brands with a justification to shift  orders and consolidate production in more efficient, cooperative, and  perhaps even ‘ethical’ suppliers.”
The lessons learned from the Nike experience have a particular appeal  in 2012. After all, the world has shrunk considerably in the last  decade, and the workplace abuses on the far side of the globe can come  back home with a swift and uncompromising speed. Additionally CSR and  corporate citizenship has taken hold, not only in the imaginations of  academics but also in the real world inhabited by consumers.
Today another corporate behemoth—the charmedApple—finds  itself facing a tsunami of criticism for the practices of yet another  overseas supplier with a less than savory reputation for workplace  safety and fair wages. Apple has been buffeted by attacks in the United  States for much of the last year for the workplace conditions and wage  rates of its Chinese manufacturer, Foxconn, which makes the incredibly  popular iPhone.
In February Apple became a participating company in the Fair Labor  Association (FLA) and, in doing so, it agreed to abide by the FLA’s  Workplace Code of Conduct throughout its supply chain. The FLA quickly  launched a series of independent investigations of Foxconn’s factories  in Shenzhen and Chengdu, China. A report detailing the FLA’s findings at  Foxconn facilities and recommendations for a broader strategy to  address workplace rights issues is due in March.
Launched in 1999 by a coalition of industry, labor and nonprofit  advocacy groups, including Nike, the FLA assesses working conditions and  monitors attempts to remedy violations in factories, farms and  facilities used by its affiliated companies. Independent assessors  schedule random visits, although critics complain that they do give  warnings of their imminent arrival, to facilities supplying  participating companies.
“We believe every worker has the right to a fair and safe work  environment free of discrimination, where they earn competitive wages  and can voice their concerns freely,” Apple CEO Tim Cook said in  February. “Apple’s suppliers must live up to this to do business with Apple.”
Apple has taken its newfound responsibility to heart. Cook says the  company will refuse to let any of its suppliers cut corners in the  future and will soon reveal new workplace standards for its entire supply chain. He said the company would continue its efforts to make any  number of benefits available to individuals working within its supply  chain, including English language lessons.
Apple is an exceptionally able company to walk the minefield of  workplace standards at this moment in time. Arguably one of the most  agile and intellectually authoritative corporations operating today, Apple has the creativity, reputation and scope to find solutions to  workplace standards and compliance for contractors that have eluded many  other companies.
By exhibiting a genuine commitment to social responsibility and  ethical business practices, corporations like Apple have the power to  not only transform their organizations but also their supply chains. A robust corporate citizenship isn’t limited by the vision of its  shareholders and customers, and its reach certainly doesn’t end with its  company headquarters.
