AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy and, in particular, life in China. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. We have written a series about the strategic strength oflocal economic development in China’s 2nd and 3rd tier citiesandentrepreneurship in China todayas well as a series aboutChina’s Belt and Road Initiative. More recently, we have written aboutChina’s big tech economyand the smart cities movement that is stretching across the globe.This post seeks to extend the conversation over our research on smart cities by looking at a new entry from Saudi Arabia. – The Editorial Team

Saudi Arabia is on a path to being a global leader in smart cities with the development of THE LINE, a zero-carbon city at NEOM, a mammoth high-tech development that will be powered by clean energy and cutting-edge technologies. Home to more than a million residents when it’s completed, THE LINE wants to be the first major urban development designed around people and not roads.
The environmentally friendly design of the project coupled with its artificial intelligence-driven (AI) infrastructure make it revolutionary, or maybe it’s really evolutionary. The future of smart cities is not only about making lives easier but also about transforming cities into engines of innovation and opportunity.

Originally, smart cities were defined as urban areas that use digital data to optimize the efficiency and operations of transport systems, energy and water supplies, waste management, law enforcement, schools, libraries, hospitals, and information systems. By leveraging the Internet of Things, cities have been able to revitalize services.
At OGL, we see smart cities as being more than technologically efficient, they’re also fiscally advantageous and an untapped economic opportunity to build a contemporary infrastructure to replace legacy systems that slow growth and reduce well being. Smart capitalism and smart leadership combine to create a cognitive future city where the only limits are the imagination of its leaders and citizens.
In redefining sustainability, THE LINE plans to include carbon-positive urban developments powered by 100% clean energy, providing healthier and more sustainable environments for residents and visitors. “Why should we sacrifice nature for the sake of development?” said His Royal Highness Mohammed bin Salman, Crown Prince and Chairman of the NEOM Board of Directors. “We need to transform the concept of a conventional city into that of a futuristic one.”
A foundation of Saudi Vision 2030, NEOM is expected to become an economic engine for the Kingdom and the region. NEOM is forecast to drive diversification and generate 380,000 jobs and contribute SAR180 billion (USD $48 billion) to Saudi Arabia’s GDP by 2030. Construction on THE LINE began in the first quarter of 2021.

Saudi Arabia’s THE LINE has also opened up opportunities with China and its Belt & Road Initiative, providing a chance for Chinese technology companies and construction companies to share in the Saudi project. Additionally, Saudi Arabia plans to turn NEOM into a new economic zone, which will operate under separate trading rules and be modeled after the city of Shenzhen in China. Shenzhen was made a special economic zone in 1980 and the friendly rules and visionary political leadership allowed for it to become an international manufacturing hub.
NEOM’s sectors of the future, headed by global industry leaders in energy, mobility, health care, and water reclamation, are already addressing some of the world’s most pressing challenges around water and energy production that will open up markets and create opportunities to attract talent, investors and partners. Ultra-high-speed transit and autonomous mobility are already at the core of solutions inside THE LINE, which will make travel easier and increase health and well being.
The Public Investment Fund (PIF), Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund, is the central investor in NEOM, and thus THE LINE. The business zone is scheduled for completion in 2025 and would cover some 170 km. The infrastructure for the city is expected to cost up to $200 billion. “The backbone of investment in ‘THE LINE’ will come from the $500 billion support to NEOM by the Saudi government, PIF and local and global investors over 10 years,” the prince noted.
In the United States and Europe, the smart cities movement has been equated with utilities that track and control everything from traffic lights to trash pickups to parking enforcement. Those innovations are making a difference in everyday lives, and they are being deployed effectively around the globe. Still, only a few nations are really looking at how to employ these smart technologies and even smarter governance to ensure a sustainable future. All our eyes are on their journeys.
