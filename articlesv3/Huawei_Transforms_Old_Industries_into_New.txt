### Huawei Transforms Old Industries into New

24 February 2021|China, Economic Development
AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy and, in particular, life in China. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. We have sought to advance a conversation about the U.S.-China relationship, and a deep understanding of local economic development in China. We have written a series about the strategic strength oflocal economic development in China’s 2nd and 3rd tier citiesandentrepreneurship in China todayas well as a series aboutChina’s Belt and Road Initiative. More recently, we have written aboutChina’s big tech economyand the companies that are changing Chinese society and the world. This post continues our conversation about China’s big tech economy. – The Editorial Team
Tech juggernaut Huawei has spent much of the last five years as the black sheep of the western political community. We have written about the US treatment of Huawei inprevious posts, but the attacks on Huawei in recent years have upped the ante. Attacked by former President Trump, who called Huawei a threat to the U.S. national security, the company saw its reputation and fortunes decline until it saw its 2020 fourth quarter sales of smartphones drop by 40%.
Interestingly (and innovatively), Huawei has found an unlikely new focus: modernizing pig farming and coal mining. The company says it has decided to apply new tech to spark an intelligent transformation in old industries in China. By applying new technologies to improve conditions in mines and increase efficiency on farms, Huawei hopes to be a technology enabler that creates healthier industries and delivers more value.
Knowing a number of executives at the company, I am not surprised that Huawei has found an innovative way to revitalize its bottom line, update old industries, and improve flagging revenues. It’s entirely possible that Huawei comes out more financially stable and is able to play an even greater role in supporting the Chinese government following the West’s attempts to clip its wings.
China is home to half of the world’s live hogs. Already, Huawei is using facial recognition technology to identify and monitor individual pigs. This will lead to new ideas about supply chain management of the food industry, and with Huawei’s cutting-edge technology, there could be important implications for blockchain management of China’s supply chains. Huawei joins JD.com and Alibaba in remaking the pig industry for the 21st century. Meanwhile, it is opening an Intelligent Mining Innovation Lab in Taiyuan, Shanxi Province, a collaboration with the provincial government and other partners, to improve safety by exploring new uses of wireless industrial control networks, industrial optical ring networks, and cloud computing.
This is a reminder that the West’s intense dislike of China and some of its largest corporations doesn’t ensure a corporate death sentence. Smart companies aren’t deterred by challenges, they are inspired. Now, Huawei is jumping into cloud computing services, smart vehicles, wearable devices, and modernizing pig farming with artificial intelligence. Go figure.
Maybe Huawei will make fewer smartphones, and it won’t have a chance, as western governments have feared, to share data with the Chinese Communist Party, but imagine what it could do with cloud computing and industrial control networks. An ambitious company will find a way to succeed, even when the odds are against it. What western observers need to remember is that the new business models may prove to be more of an economic threat to the West than the original smartphone maker.
