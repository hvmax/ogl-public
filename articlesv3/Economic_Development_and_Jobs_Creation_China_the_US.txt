### Economic Development and Jobs Creation: China & the U.S.

3 December 2020|China, City Profile, Innovation
AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy and, in particular, life in China. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. We have sought to advance a conversation about the U.S.-China relationship, and a deep understanding of local economic development in China. We have written a series of articles about the strategic strength oflocal economic development in China’s 2nd and 3rd tier citiesandentrepreneurship in China today. This post draws on those insights to analyze developments and trends as they relate to economic development in American cities. – The Editorial Team

AtOn Global Leadership, one of our areas of focus has been helping our readers understand the unique style of capitalism in China. The path China has taken to economic prosperity over the last four decades counters Western ideals about free markets and the ingenuity of business. China’s rise is not simply the result of a deep cheap labor pool and protectionist Central Government, as is often assumed in simplistic analyses of China’s rise.
China is succeedingbecauseof its many differences with the West, including economic development models that emphasize incentives and strategic thinking in areas of local economic growth. China’s rise is specifically the result of four decades of careful, gradual strategic planning that has balanced central control with a type of radical entrepreneurialism among local governments and a population that encourages economic and technological innovation.
Economic Development Theory: Chinese Style
As we have written, we believe that one of the great ironies of our time is this: the largest communist society in the world has produced smarter capitalists and better stewards of the economy than the world’s largest capitalist economy. There is a reason China will soon become the world’s largest economy. It is the result of complex economic development approaches that balance guidance from the Central Government with an incentive-driven approach to entrepreneurial governance in the localities.
Here is how it works:
Guidance from the Central Government. Chinese economic development is, at a very basic level, guided by centralized planning and control from Beijing. The Central Government takes its five-year and 10-year strategic plans very seriously, and these plans are often tied to issues such as economic growth (GDP and per capita GDP); poverty alleviation; development of China’s inland and western areas; investment in the “Global South” (through the Belt and Road Initiative); development of specific industry sectors and clusters; development of a consumption-based economy; and many others. These goals and aspirations, which are laid out in five- and 10-year plans, are critical in guiding the nation, local officials, and the private sector. This approach stands in stark contrast to the U.S.-based notion that free markets are the most efficient and innovative allocators of research, which grew in popularity under the guidance of the conservative economist, Milton Friedman, who served as the economic czar under President Ronald Reagan. In China, there is a broad understanding in government, corporate, and small-scale entrepreneurial sectors that government guidance and stewardship of the economy is a positive factor.
Autonomy, Entrepreneurialism, and Local Governments at Industrial Firms. Inpreviousessays, we have used the metaphor, borrowed from the great China scholar Andrew Walder, of “local governments as industrial firms,” and we find it the most apt here as well. While we often think of the Chinese government as the authoritarian, protectionist, centralized party in Beijing, churning out five-year plans and enacting major initiatives, those characteristics are only one side of the government. In reality, local governments at provincial, city, district, county, and village levels are the entrepreneurial engines driving China’s powerful economy. Indeed, the Chinese government is an extremely decentralized and entrepreneurial system of district and township governments. Beyond China’s Central Government, the country is made up of 31 provincial level units – generally large bodies of land (like states in the U.S.), though there are also four provincial-level municipalities included in this group (Beijing, Chongqing, Shanghai, and Tianjin). Below these provincial units are about 800 municipalities, which are segmented into district governments.
Government Officials as Corporate CEOs. The mayors of China’s districts and townships behave like corporate CEOs, focusing on KPIs, pursuing foreign investment, and advancing their own careers through the financial and economic achievements in their jurisdictions. It is crucial that their actions and goals line up with the municipalities and provinces above them, but they are given discretion and incentives to drive their own localities to achieve those goals. To further explain the industrial firm metaphor, district heads must deliver against the strategic plans of the holding company (the Central Government) and the corporation (the provincial or municipal government), but they also have a significant amount of autonomy to run their business units (their district governments) as they see fit. (“Autonomy” is a sensitive word in this context. We are thinking of the concept ofzizhuquan[自主权] as opposed tozizhiquan[自治权]. Both are translated in Chinese-English dictionaries as “autonomy” but there is a subtle difference. The former is using authorized (delegated) power; the latter has a self-governing meaning, which is not pertinent here.]
Partnerships with the Private Sector. Economic development in China is replete with stories of entrepreneurial local governments and the building of their areas economically. But local governments don’t do it alone. They do it through close coordination with China’s private sector and investors from abroad. Those organizations bring resources, technology, create jobs, and help the local governments build the local economies. Companies like General Motors, Tesla, General Electric, Apple, Foxconn, Alibaba, and many others have invested significantly in China’s local economies to build factories, employ workers, build infrastructure, and help the local officials meet their KPIs.
A Few Chinese Examples
To illuminate these dynamics, we have studied and written about economic development in Chinese cities such asZhengzhou(see alsohere),Dongguan,Suzhou, andShanghai, among others. Take, for example, a recent case in Shanghai, and the transformation of Baosteel, a Chinese state-owned enterprise. A behemoth following its merger with Wuhan Steel, Baosteel made a remarkable foray into running data centers to serve major cloud computing companies. How did a company that runs steel plants get into the datacenter business? It turns out that steel plants have several attributes that make them incredibly well placed to host a data server farm: a large amount of space, vast energy sources (most are built next to major water sources), and a temperature-controlled environment. And with steel becoming increasingly commoditized, policymakers nudged this state-owned company, which already had a large subsidiary in the information technology business, toward a new business opportunity by establishing server farms on the premises ofdisused steel factories. This notably occurred in urban centers like Shanghai, where residents who were previously unhappy living in close proximity to such sources of pollution didn’t mind having data centers nearby. Moreover, with the rise of cloud computing in China, there is a voracious appetite for data centers and this transformation represented a lucrative opportunity for Baosteel.

The Baosteel example might seem to be one of state-led innovation.[1]However, e-commerce giant Alibaba also worked within this type of partnership. In the case of the Baosteel, digitalecosystem giantsare very much in the picture. Who is Baosteel’s most prominent client for its data centers? Alibaba, of course. Thus, the government’s goal of fostering innovation among industrial companies – such as the steel sector – could intersect with fulfilling the data processing needs of a company like Alibaba. Indeed, it could be argued that the data server farms that Baosteel now host hold promise only because of the ecosystems being orchestrated by the likes of Alibaba and Tencent. For its part, Alibaba is keenly aware that its own activities in promoting domestic and cross-border trade are directly aligned with the government’s agenda to move the economy from a reliance on export-led manufacturing to domestic consumption.
An instructive case of government-industry partnership is the transformation of Zhengzhou, a (now) Tier 1 City in Henan Province. Henan Province started courting Apple partner Foxconn as early as 2007, under the leadership of a task force led by the mayor of Zhengzhou. There was a long period of courtship, and by 2009, Foxconn’s founder and CEO, Terry Gou, finally made up his mind to move Foxconn’s production base inland to Zhengzhou.
The project contract was signed in mid-2010, and construction began immediately for the temporary plant. A state-owned construction company in Zhengzhou arranged 2,000 workers to work in three shifts 24x7. The renovation of a standard factory building of 62,500 square meters was completed in less than a month. Because the available plant area was not big enough, a textile company located in the same zone was “persuaded” to move out immediately. The special cables and air compressors required by Foxconn’s plant were not available in the market, and the government stopped subway construction in Zhengzhou and transferred similar equipment to meet Foxconn’s needs. On August 2, Zhengzhou Foxconn officially went into production at the temporary plant. It took only one month from initial investment agreement to the landing of the first batch of parts.
Zhengzhou Airport Economic Zone

Starting mid-September 2010, more than 6,000 construction workers were working day and night on a large construction site in the Zhengzhou Airport Economic Zone, 5 kilometers north of the airport runway. The 12-month project was completed in four months. At the end of 2010, a state-of-the-art factory building with a total construction area of 600,000 square meters was completed. Then, a labor force of 100,000 strong, recruited with the support of the government, joined assembly lines in the new factory, where popular iPhones went through final assembly and then shipped worldwide. The mega plant of Zhengzhou Foxconn now has more than 200,000 employees, hosts over 90 production lines, and conducts final assembly for about half of the world’s iPhones.
On March 28, 2012, Tim Cook visited an iPhone production plant in Zhengzhou (郑州) City on his first trip to China as the CEO of Apple – a marker of a long relationship among the Zhengzhou Government and corporate titans like Foxconn and Apple. Undoubtedly, this was a case of an entrepreneurial local government, close coordination with the Central and Provincial Governments, and the coordination with the private sector and foreign investors. It was a case that resulted in massive investment in infrastructure, private sector spending, and job creation. And it drove Zhengzhou’s transition from the solid ground of a Tier 2 city to the hallowed land of Tier 1 in a span of five years.
Bright Spots in America
In talking up the Chinese economic development model, we have also been implicitly (and sometimes explicitly) critical of the American model. As China implemented its economic reforms, the United States has been embracing an ideology where markets and the private sector govern economic development and growth. In the U.S., President Trump judges the economy based on the strength of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA). In the world’s largest economy, the wealthiest 10% of the economy own more than 80% of the publicly traded stock, of which the DJIA is the main measure. Furthermore, in the so-called land of opportunity, the United States has the highest Gini Coefficient of any OECD Nation (and one that is significantly higher than China’s). Perhaps there is something we can learn about economic development here.
We have long argued that rebuilding American manufacturing and local economies is not simply about tariffs and trade. Recently, wechallengedour readers to “find a credible economist who will agree… that the tariffs are (a) good for American consumers and (b) will make any headway on bringing jobs back to America.” (Hint: there aren’t any.) What is required for rebuilding manufacturing in America is opening borders for foreign investment coupled with empowering entrepreneurial local governments to act as partners and stewards of the private sector. In other words, instead of slapping tariffs on imports from China, a better strategy would be to follow China’s model of local economic development and growth.
The Five-Year Economic Development Strategy for the District of Columbia
The Five-Year Economic Development Strategy for the District of Columbia
There are bright spots for some American localities. U.S. cities  such as theDistrict of Columbiahave embarked on entrepreneurial economic development planning that rivals the work in China. Between 2011 and 2014, a very entrepreneurial Mayor Vincent Gray and his exceedingly entrepreneurial Deputy Mayor for Planning and Economic Development Victor Hoskins deployed planning on a grand scale. Hoskins was a star in the economic development field, and he reached out to build partnerships with local universities to channel students into the service of strategic thinking on planning and economic development. With his new model of public-private partnerships, Hoskins oversaw the research and writing of a strategic economic plan that attracted capital from China – through a sister-city agreement with the Suzhou Industrial Park – and helped create over 100,000 new job in D.C. Using careful economic impact modeling, the economic strategy helped raise tax revenues for the city as well.
TheFive-Year Economic Development Strategy for the District of Columbiafocused on specific industries including real estate development, government services, and the creative economy. It was a beautiful execution on a difficult economic problem. Later, Hoskins went on to become Director of Economic Development for Arlington County where he oversaw the process of attracting Amazon to build its second headquarters (HQ2) in the area, thereby creating tens of thousands of jobs. Currently, Hoskins is President and CEO of the Fairfax County Economic Development Authority.
Another city that exhibits its entrepreneurial characteristics is the City of Phoenix. It already shows all the signs of an economy that will grow stronger and stronger over time. First, there is an innovative government intent on building the infrastructure to create jobs and a thriving local economy and establishing a new high-tech manufacturing economy. Mayor Kate Gallego seems to have all the energy and insight needed to build coalitions to solve complex economic development problems. Second, there is a strong commitment to public-public and public-private partnerships. The relationships among the city, county, and state governments are strong, and there is a pledge to build a local economy – both service and manufacturing sectors. And there are strong ties to local educational institutions such as Arizona State University and its Thunderbird School of Global Management. Third, Phoenix is already attracting foreign capital. As reported by Reuters in November 2020, “City officials in Phoenix, Arizona, … unanimously voted to authorize a development agreement with chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. that would provide $205 million in city funds for infrastructure such as roads and water improvements for a planned $12 billion semiconductor factory in the city.” In exchange for local investment in infrastructure, the new TSMC factory is committed to creating about 1,900 new, full-time technical manufacturing jobs and will surely put Phoenix on the map as a hub for the high-tech manufacturing industry.
It is a brilliant move by the city and the new mayor, but building industry clusters takes time, investment, strategic thinking, careful economic planning, and a lot of partnerships. That is what Chinese municipalities have been doing. It’s great to see U.S. localities doing the same.
