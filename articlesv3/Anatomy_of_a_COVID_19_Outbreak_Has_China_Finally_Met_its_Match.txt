### Anatomy of a COVID-19 Outbreak: Has China Finally Met its Match?

11 April 2022|China, Coronavirus, Public Health
AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy and, in particular, life in China. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. Our in-depth research often focuses on how China deals with problems, particularly COVID-19, and how it has maneuvered through the pandemic through thorough testing, aggressive tracking, and voluntary changes by the general public. We have written several essays,hereandhere, analyzing China’s progress in dealing with the pandemic over the last two years. This post continues that conversation, – The Editorial Team.

Twenty-four months ago, Chinese citizens were coming out of their homes, disoriented from having been locked down for two months. They had been separated from most people except their close relatives or friends with whom they lived. Across the nation, city residents began to cautiously board metros and public buses to return to work.
The Chinese government was just rolling out newly minted COVID-19 management rules. The whole country was focused on following the news to try to understand what was expected of the citizenry. International airports became self-enclosed pods managed by staff who oversaw the gauntlet of testing, reporting, and shepherding arrivals to buses and quarantine hotels.
From time to time, an outbreak would occur somewhere in China. Whether it was in the far northwest Xinjiang, down in the south along the border of Yunnan Province with Myanmar, or an eruption down the street caused by an employee working in the cargo area of one of the international airports, the trained armies of medics, community volunteers, and local officials would snap to work. Usually within a 14- to 28-day period the outbreak would be contained. A collective sigh of relief could be heard across the nation and life would return to COVID normal.
A Spreading Sub-variant
For most of the last 24 months, Hong Kong was admired by the world for its successful application of the “Zero COVID” policy – a policy advocated by the Chinese Central government led by President Xi Jinping. There had been only four outbreaks in Hong Kong, but with a similar execution process each variant wave was brought under control.
Things started to change around Christmas of 2021. Christmas is the beginning of the holiday season in Hong Kong, which ends with the Chinese New Year more than a month later. Hong Kong residents tend to travel around the world for the holidays, and then return to their homes. That's when the cases started to rise. For months before Christmas, the average case rate had been running 2 to 7 per day. That’s a respectable amount if one compares it to the rest of the world. As the cases were found upon arrival, and then kept in quarantine centers, the government felt the situation was well under control.
After Christmas, however, the daily imported case rate rose above 10 and never saw single digits again. It was a slow simmer though. Not until January 18, 2022, was there a sudden spike of 34 cases and except for a day or two when the case count seemed to reduce, Hong Kong was off to the races.
This brand of COVID was not just any old Omicron variant, but the BA.2 "stealth" variant with an R0 of 9.5 compared to the original variant rate of infection of R0 3. The source of the fifth wave was a Pakistani woman returning from abroad who had been in quarantine at the Silka Hotel Seaview in Yaumatei. She tested positive, and was asymptomatic, just a few days after discharge from 21 days in quarantine.
Authorities soon discovered that poor ventilation in this value  hotel was responsible for the women's positive result. It was suspected that she contracted Omicron from a positive guest in the room next to hers when she opened the door to collect her meals. By using a “smoke test” the health officials confirmed that the air in the hallways would enter rooms. This resulted in one of several clusters across Hong Kong when her husband, after being infected visited a Yat Kwai Chung, one of the 16 towers in the Kwai Chung Estate where he infected several tenants there. Additionally, another cluster was created by an infected shipment of hamsters from the Netherlands on Dec. 22 and Jan. 7. What became known as the Little Boss pet shop cluster started in Causeway Bay was actually a Delta variant infecting a 23-year-old salesperson, five customers, and 11 hamsters, which resulted in the culling of 2,000 hamsters.
Highly contagious, it was no surprise that the case numbers rose exponentially, putting undue strain on the health care system in Hong Kong. Patients were laying on gurneys outside in parking lots, unprotected from the elements. The queues at hospitals became interminably long, and ambulances and supplies short. Quarantine hotels were full, and even though the government announced plans to build a large quarantine center like in Wuhan, internally the plan was not acted upon as there was no location selected and there was no budget.
While Hong Kong was boiling over, cases were being exported to Shenzhen through the supply chain and regular passenger traffic. (The 2020 annual cross boundary traffic between Hong Kong and Shenzhen was 17 million people via trains, buses, and autos.) Along with the vast trucking shipments moving products and food across the border daily, it was only a matter of time before Omicron jumped the border into Shenzhen. By March 13, Shenzhen, the technology center of China with a population of 17 million, was locked down as well as many of the satellite cities around Shenzhen.
As Shenzhen’s numbers climbed, Shanghai suddenly found itself facing an outbreak of the Omicron in a quarantine hotel in Xuhui District. And like Hong Kong, the ensuing outbreak was attributed to lapses in quarantine management procedures in the hotel. For more than two months, as case numbers exploded in Hong Kong, it was no surprise that the number of daily imported cases flying into Shanghai Pudong International Airport bloomed to more than 40 a day. Indeed, the HuaTing Hotel, which had been the first 5-star hotel in Shanghai and was branded as the Sheraton, was soon turned into a quarantine hotel. Located in Xuhui District, a downtown area, the hotel is ground zero for the current outbreak.
Like Hong Kong when the first Omicron cases were identified, Shanghai health officials were slow to respond. Trying to limit the impact only to the neighborhoods around the hotel, and following the trail of cases through tracking and tracing close contacts, positive cases were moved to quarantine centers, while increasing the volume of testing in neighborhoods with specific infections.
Compared to the 2020 effort, the idea was to use a scalpel rather than a chainsaw to contain the virus, and thus limit the scope of infections. The problem with the Omicron sub-variant is the contagion rate is high, the incubation period is short, and the majority of cases are asymptomatic. By the time close contacts were identified and pulled into centers, they had already infected even more patients. Back in 2020, a delay of a couple of weeks did see a spike, but with clear instructions and firm action the results were quite successful. Omicron gives no space for a slow response. At the writing of this article, Shanghai had registered over 16,000 asymptomatic cases in a day.
What Has Been Learned About the Omicron Variant?
The conditions in Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland are very similar in that both have not had until now a major endemic outbreak. Both have lower vaccination efficiency in the elderly, and both have followed the same “dynamic zero case” objective, thus a lot can be learned from the Hong Kong experience by the mainland authorities. First, based on research data from the University of Hong Kong (HKU) confirms that both the mRNA type vaccine and the inactivated vaccines reduce the risk of severe illness and death with almost equal effectiveness. As the chart below outlines, if one has three injections including the booster, the protection rate is almost the same. This is  important for the most vulnerable populations, especially seniors over the age of 70.
Additionally, based on an earlier research project in January 2022, also by a research team at HKU, the difference in the effectiveness at the single dose stage is quite wide at 71.8% when inoculated with one injection of the mRNA and 40.5% with only one injection of inactivated vaccine. This wide variance cannot be ignored and should be the impetus for a vaccine drive across the mainland.
Key lessons from the Hong Kong experience, as shared by the School of Biomedical Sciences at UHK, which should be closely analyzed by mainland authorities:
While the Omicron B2 variant is more contagious, it's not more virulent: 99% of the cases are either asymptomatic or with mild symptoms.There is a clear distinction between those who are vaccinated and those who are not vaccinated – especially those with underlying medical conditions – so the focus should be on rigorous vaccination programs to build a safety net for those most vulnerable and to reduce the burden on the medical system.The contagion rate of the Omicron B2 variant makes it almost impossible to conduct track and trace exercises. Humans just cannot move fast enough.While the virility rate of Omicron is proving not high for adults, a recent report on the impact on children in Hong Kong does make clear that children who are not vaccinated do have a higher death rate than adults. So again, vaccination is the key to protecting children. Currently in Hong Kong, per the HKSAR Vaccination Dashboard, as of April 5, only 61.4% of the children in Hong Kong between the ages 3-11 have received the first dose, shockingly 25% have received the second dose. This lag in vaccinations of young children is not a good sign for the near future and the impact on that population. China needs to learn from this experience to ensure children across the country do indeed get vaccinated.

COVID-19 is going to be with the world for a long time, and it will be critical that the leadership of every country learn from each other’s experiences. The Hong Kong hotel misstep was repeated almost exactly two months later in Shanghai with the same results. The Omicron variant is running wild throughout Shanghai and beyond. Chinese citizens generally understand the need for a quick response and are willing to accept lockdown as seen in other cities in China, both large and small. Up to now, China’s zero-COVID policy had accomplished a major target of preventing mass deaths by focusing on “people first, life first" -- surprising the world with its effectiveness.
Great efforts, resources, and emotions are now being spent to contain the current spread. The question is: Has China come face-to-face with the reality of this phase of the pandemic?
