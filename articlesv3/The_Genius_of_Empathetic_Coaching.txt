### The Genius of Empathetic Coaching

15 May 2023|Creative Leadership, Leadership, Leadership Development
AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide analyses about leadership in the global economy. In this post, we touch on the issues of honesty, vulnerability, and mental health. In this post, I reflect on some of these aspects of teaching and coaching leadership, as they have been on my mind lately. In a recent interview on CB Bowman’sCourage to Leap and Lead Podcast(part 1here, part 2here), I talk openly about my own failures and my struggles with mental health. We introduce that conversation in this post to continue to advance the discussion about the importance of honesty and vulnerability in leadership.
Over the last year, I have had the wonderful opportunity to meet, engage, and collaborate with some of the finest leadership thinkers and coaches in the world. This has come after a period in which I have suffered some painful twists in my career and life. As a result of these experiences, I decided to become more personal and open in my teaching, coaching, and writing about leadership.
As a professor of Global Leadership and an executive coach, I spend a lot of time thinking about what makes a good leader. It is a topic that has evolved for me over the years, both through my own experience and how I have learned to teach and talk about it. In previous postings of articles on the On Global Leadership platform, I have attempted to write frankly abouthumility,overcoming arrogance, vulnerability, and embracing the small lessons ineveryday leadership(see alsohere,here,here).
Enter CB Bowman and Mark Goulston
One of the gifts of this period of my life is having the fortune of being invited to be a member ofMarshall Goldsmith’s 100 Coaches(MG100). It is truly an honor to be a part of this group, and I often don’t feel worthy of being included because there are so many impressive coaching professionals. Most importantly, it has also brought me the honor of being in dialogue and, in a few cases, friendship with amazing people in the corporate coaching world.

Recently, I was invited to do a podcast with CB Bowman. CB is a rock star – an excellent, deep, and insightful person. She is an executive coach and another member of the MG100, which is where we first came to know each other. She is the founder and CEO ofCourage Consultingand theAssociation of Corporate Executive Coaches. She is a prolific speaker and author, including the forthcoming book,The Courage to Leap and Lead. And she is host of The Courage to Leap and Leadpodcast. (My two-part interview with CB can be foundhere.)
Interviewing with CB was an experience I will never forget. She is not only brilliant and charismatic, but she also has an amazing interview style. She is good at balancing her own insights and experiences with probing questions that invite (and push) the interviewee to take the discussion to deeper and more vulnerable places. Her subtle questions about leadership pushed these conversations to greater depths than is typical in a podcast interview.

A similar thing happened for me with Executive Coach Mark Goulston, though our dynamic evolved more gradually and over time. Mark is also an exceptional person, and I feel so fortunate to call him a dear friend. Mark is a retired psychiatrist, who spent his career saving people’s lives – literally; his area of focus in his practice in in working with people struggling with suicidal ideation. He is now a heavily sought after speaker, executive coach and bestselling author of books likeGet Out of Your Own Way: Overcoming Self-Defeating BehaviorandJust Listen: Discover the Secret to Getting Through to Absolutely Anyone. He is also a brilliant conversationalist, from whom I have learned tremendously as we have been talking.
As part of the MG100 group, we are occasionally asked to form small groups to better get to know the other coaches. Mark and I found ourselves in one such group. As I reflected on how to introduce myself, I decided to go all in on honesty and vulnerability. After the introduction, Mark approached me about talking off-line about my own experiences and the future of coaching. That was the beginning of a set of conversations and a collaboration that has endured.
Through both of these executive coaches and thought leaders, I have learned about the breadth of opportunities to expand the coaching relationship, focusing not only on the career but also on how the individual’s deeply personal experiences influence, shape, and determine how they interact with the world. It is a reminder of the profound effect that caring and thoughtful coaches can have on executives and others as they contemplate their futures.
