AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy and, in particular, life in China. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. We have also written about thehistoryandcurrent stateof U.S.-China relations. Recently, we have written about the 50th anniversary ofPresident Nixon's visit to Chinaand how U.S.-China relations have evolved over that period (e.g.,here,here, andhere). In this post, we examine U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen’s recent visit to China.

Less than a month after U.S. Secretary State Anthony Blinken’s trip to China, Secretary of Treasury Janet Yellen visited the United States’ largest trading partner in early July. Needless to say, with tensions as high as they are, pundits and citizens in both countries closely watched as Yellen spent four days in Beijing, where she met with key officials such as Premier Li Qiang and Vice Premier He Lifeng.
While there was no resolution to any of the thorny issues raised in their meetings, the goal of creating a dynamic for a respectful dialogue between the two nations was clearly achieved in our view. It was a stark contrast to the tone that followed Blinken’s visit a few weeks earlier. Blinken was not disrespectful in his comments following his China meetings, but he did emphasize the United States’ “responsibility to defend, protect and advance the interests of the United States and its people” as being a motivator in its relationship with China. The message did not come across as conciliatory. Yellen’s tone was more positive.
Yellen said at her July 9 press conference in Beijing: “The U.S. and China have significant disagreements. Those disagreements need to be communicated clearly and directly. But President Biden and I do not see the relationship between the U.S. and China through the frame of great power conflict. We believe that the world is big enough for both of our countries to thrive. Both nations have an obligation to responsibly manage this relationship: to find a way to live together and share in global prosperity.”
A quick review at these comments may set observers who worry about the tense tone of U.S.-China relations at ease. Where we recently noted the jingoistic tone toward China of some Republicans, including GOP Presidential CandidateNikki Haley, Yellen’s comments were measured, respectful, and clear. She did not shy away from difficult topics, such as concerns over the treatment of American companies and the Belt and Road Initiative fueling debt in emerging markets. She also raised the issue of greater cooperation between the two nations on the issue of climate change.
China is a nation with a long and proud history, and the issue of being given a suitable level of respect in dealing with the West is always a central concern in U.S.-China relations (see, e.g.,here,here). It is crucial China be treated as a true partner in the push to continue developing mutually beneficial outcomes for the world’s two largest economies (see, e.g.,here,here,here). Barring a catastrophic change in trading practices and global production, China will become the world’s largest economy in the next decade or so. [We agree with China in predicting that this will occur by 2035 (see and listen,here)].
China’s media described the exchanges as “in-depth, candid and pragmatic” and the talks as "constructive”, while Yellen used “candid, constructive and comprehensive.” Similar wording may suggest more that both sides coordinated their messaging about how positive the interactions had been. Chinese officials and social media generally see Yellen as a relatively pragmatic official within the Biden Administration, with softer and lesser ideological rhetoric toward China. Later this month, John Kerry, the special presidential envoy for climate change, will visit China.
Yellen’s marathon session of meetings, chewing up 10 hours over two days, with top Chinese officials was viewed as a sign of respect and seriousness for her official Chinese counterparts. Yellen also met with Liu He, the retired Vice Premier, and Zhou Xiaochuan, a former Governor of the PBC, who are both officials she had dealt with when she was Chair of the U.S. Federal Reserve Board. These meetings, which were not official or recorded, allowed for more open and frank conversations, which could prove constructive in moving diplomacy forward.
As Yellen noted, seeking to decouple from China “would be disastrous for both countries and destabilizing for the world.” And, as we have emphasized in other writing (e.g., here), the idea that the United States can simply “decouple” by finding other sites for cheap labor simply misunderstands the depth and power of China’s manufacturing supply chain and the ways in which companies like Apple and Tesla would suffer for years in the wake of a “decoupling” (here). In this sense, Yellen’s visit sent a strong signal about the path toward stabilizing this crucial relationship.
To be sure, the conversations, rational as they appeared, were not all roses. Shortly before Yellen’s arrival, China announced the prospect of curbing the export of gallium and germanium, rare earth metals seen as crucial for cutting-edge technologies such as semiconductors and space technology. The export limit would begin on August 1. China controls the mining and refinement of about 60% and 80% of the world’s supply for these two precious elements. Many speculated that China had raised this prospect to create a bargaining chip for negotiations.
“I am … concerned about new export controls recently announced by China on two critical minerals used in technologies like semiconductors,” Yellen said during a meeting with the American Chamber of Commerce in Beijing. “We are still evaluating the impact of these actions, but they remind us of the importance of building resilient and diversified supply chains.”
But China also appeared to be mending fences in advance of the visit. Before Yellen’s arrival, the Shanghai Jinan district party chief Yu Yong and his team visited Bain & Company’s office in the district. He was surveying business conditions and offering his assistance to Weiwen Han, head of the advisory business’s greater China offices. In April, Chinese authorities questioned Bain’s Shanghai office employees in what appeared to be China flexing its own muscles in response to what it considered unfair U.S. trade practices.
So, the complex set of issues here is not about just Apple, Tesla, and other western companies requiring access to China’s manufacturing supply chain. It is about the United States and China continuing to build on their trade relationship to the benefit of every U.S. company operating or seeking to operate in China. To reiterate Yellen’s words, a decoupling would be disastrous for both countries.
China’s government was moderating in its assessment of the talks as well. “The two sides agreed to strengthen communication and cooperation on addressing global challenges, and continue maintaining exchanges and interactions,” according to Xinhua, China’s official state news agency.
Yellen’s diplomacy extended beyond official meetings to two interesting side events that seemed to capture the Chinese news media’s attention. She had lunch with a group of Chinese women who are economists and entrepreneurs, and she visited a restaurant that featured cuisine from the province of Yunnan, where she showed a mastery of chopsticks.
There are still difficult times ahead for U.S.-China relations. We remain concerned and continue to advocate calm, respectful dialogue between the world’s two largest economies. Yellen has taken critical steps to rebuilding a constructive dialogue, and we expect Kerry will bring the same courteous approach in his meetings later in July.
