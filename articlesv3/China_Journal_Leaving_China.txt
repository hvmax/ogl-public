### China Journal: Leaving China

17 December 2023|China, China history, China politics, China Population
AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide analyses about leadership in the global economy. In this post, Dr. Doug Guthrie, who is a co-founder of OGL, continues to curate a special series of China Journal entries over the next two weeks as he returns to China for the first time in four years. In this post, Dr. Guthrie recalls his final days in China and looks forward to the future.
Beyond the fascinating interviews in this return-to-China research visit, there were other fulfilling activities as well. In my role as Thunderbird Professor and Executive Director of China Initiatives, I spent time working with Cintana Education, Arizona State University's main partner in designing and delivering innovative education and Thunderbird’s main recruitment agent for our (relatively) new program, the Mandarin Master’s in Leadership and Management (MLM).
We filmed new recruitment videos and held a recruitment event, which brought together Thunderbird Alumni with prospective students for the program. This event was very engaging and brought home just how tense U.S.-China relations are right now and how thirsty young professionals are for knowledge about global political economy issues.
It also drove home how important it is that a school founded in the wake of the devastating Second World War on the premise that “borders frequented by trade seldom need soldiers. In other words, get the economic activity going, create economic interdependence, build mutually prosperous relationships, and the world will be a better, more peaceful place. Thunderbird and, more generally, institutions of higher education will continue to play important roles in how the world comes together in these difficult times.
I also attended a talk by Scott Walker, the Consul General, U.S. Consulate, Shanghai. Walker talked about what a big year this has been, citing visits by U.S. Cabinet Secretaries Tony Blinken, Janet Yellen, Gina Raimondo, and California Governor Gavin Newsom. He then discussed the presidents summit, the Biden-Xi meeting at San Francisco’s APEC Summit. He noted that Biden had said the meetings were some of the most productive the two leaders have ever had. As Walker pointed out, there were disagreements to be sure, but the areas of positive agreement far outweighed the negatives – military-to-military conversations, AI safety coordination, climate cooperation. All of the “biggies,” if you will.
In my final day in my beloved Shanghai, I gave one more talk at the American Chamber of Commerce’s Downtown Office. This one was a little more explicitly about U.S.-China relations and the continued competitive economic development of the world’s two largest trading partners. I began with my China Bull thesis that China is running a better capitalist economy than we are in the United States, an argument I have been makingfor some time now. In this talk, interestingly, there was fairly significant pushback.
While many in the room were publicly laudatory and kind in their comments, after the talk, the real debate began. Many expressed deep concern over the ethos of the rising Chinese entrepreneurial class and the foreign investment community. The negative views of the former group fits well with the flight of capital among China’s emerging economic elite; the negative views of the latter are backed up by the decline in foreign direct investment.
While I have strong arguments against the bell-weather reading of declining FDI numbers as evidence of a falling Chinese economy, I was less familiar with the ethos of China’s young economic elite. After the talk, my OGL collaborator and business partner Diane Long arranged a dinner with one of these young economic elites who personifies capital flight. This individual has a successful private equity firm and has done very well, but he has decided to shut it down and join his family in the United States. He gave me a lot to think about. Once again highlighting the importance of in-person research. You have to talk to real people to gain a deep nuanced understanding of what is actually going on.
Expats and entrepreneurs
Following my talk, I went back to see Mike Rosenthal in action again. Mike was chairing a business plan competition, where young Chinese entrepreneurs come to the prestigious and glitzy Shanghai Financial Center in Pudong’s Lujiazui to present their business plans to a panel of three judges. The business plan presentations were not super impressive – these entrepreneurs were still a few years away from being ready for an invitation from ABC's Shark Tank. But the relative inexperience of these entrepreneurs is not what caught my eye. What impressed me here was the institution and community building that a bunch of Expats were helping young Chinese entrepreneurs further their businesses and succeed.
That’s all for now. Thank you for reading. Several of these interviews with translate into the casework that forms the basis for much of our writing on the OGL site (and in the book we are working to deliver). So, I mean it when I say, I hope you will come back and read more.
And here’s to hoping for continued engagement and economic and political collaboration between China and the United States and across the world. More soon. –Doug
