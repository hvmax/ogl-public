### In Memoriam: The Passing of Respected China Scholar Ezra Vogel

21 December 2020|China
Long-time Harvard University professor Ezra Vogel, 90, a legendary China and Japan scholar, passed away on Sunday, December 20. AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy and, in particular, life in China. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic and sociological analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. In this post, we reflect on the passing of sociologist Ezra Vogel, a luminary and legend in the China field. – The Editorial Team.

This tribute is personal for me. As I grew up as a China scholar in the 1990s and 2000s, there were few who cast a shadow over modern Asian studies as widely and significantly as Professor Ezra Vogel. Although I was not one of his students, he was my mentor’s mentor. (I studied under Professor Thomas Gold and he, in turn, was a longtime student of Professor Vogel.) I did not  know Professor Vogel well, but the times I did interact with him, he was always among the kindest and most generous of individuals in academia.
I did know his work well, though. Through a career that spanned six decades, he studied a variety of subjects across numerous countries and various academic disciplines including sociology and area studies. He was also a best-selling author in the United States, Japan, and China.
In many ways, Professor Vogel represented a bygone tradition of sociological and area studies research. In today’s academic environment, where scholars are encouraged to specialize, honing their skills on very specific areas of research and knowledge, the breadth of his knowledge and scholarship was an inspirational and unobtainable standard. Indeed, I cannot think of another scholar of Asian societies that has had such a significant impact on the scholarship ofbothChinese and Japanese societies. When I was growing up as a graduate student, I always knew Professor Vogel as a China scholar. I clearly remember the moment when I realized this breadth. Having spent years devoting myself to mastering the Chinese language, I remember thinking, “Wait, Professor Vogel speaks Japanese as well as he speaks Chinese?”
Beyond his astute sociological analyses of Japanese and Chinese societies, Professor Vogel also translated his scholarship for the policy world. He was considered a gradualist who believed western policies needed to recognize the complexity of China's politics before it took action or judged the actions of China's leadership. He had been circumspect on the Tiananmen Square demonstrations in 1989 and suggested pro-democracy protesters were “naïve” in their approach.
He was a prolific writer, and, following his best-sellingJapan as Number One(1999), he gained even more attention for his landmark biography of Deng Xiaoping, which was published in 2011 when he was 81.Deng Xiaoping and the Transformation of Chinastudied Deng and his goal of opening China up to the world.
One of Professor Vogel's most recent insightful pronouncements on China came in July 2020 inThe Washington Post, where he said the United States under President Trump was pushing away its friends inside China with bad policy and a disrespectful pomposity.
"In recent years, U.S. policy and political rhetoric toward China have been dominated by officials with limited knowledge of developments in that country,"Vogel wrote in the op-ed."It is not in the United States’ interest to turn the Chinese into enemies. If we want to encourage them to work with us for our common interests, we need some fundamental rethinking of our policies."
That response to the feckless policies of the Trump administration was not surprising coming from Professor Vogel, a man who fully respected China for its culture, language, and history.
In the days after his death, most major newspapers in China had remembrances of him, reflecting on his interest and commitment to a deeper understanding of China and its people. They especially appreciated his willingness to take the time needed to understand China.
For a young scholar such as myself at the time, and even now for an older and wiser China hand, his was an inspirational career that crossed borders – both political and geographic – and significantly elevated scholarship of Asian societies in the academic and public spheres.
Doug Guthrie has been a China scholar since the late 1980s, when he began studying Chinese language, literature and history at the University of Chicago. After graduate work at the University of California, Berkeley, he was a Professor of Management and Sociology at New York University for several years (1997-2010) and served as Dean of the School of Business and Vice President for University China Operations at the George Washington University (2010-14). From 2015-2019, he was a Senior Director at Apple and was based in China. Currently, he is Professor of Global Leadership at the Thunderbird School of Global Management, where he is also Director of China Initiatives and Executive Director of Thunderbird Global.
