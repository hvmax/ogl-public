### The Junior Partner

(This column was originally published on Forbes.com. It has been updated to reflect additional thoughts.)
For many years, the United States has  been recognized as the global expert in responsible capital investment,  but we may soon find ourselves in the junior partner role with China  taking the lead.
Two recent meetings I attended with Chinese  executives illustrated that this surprising shift in our status is  already happening. As the dean of a business school and a China scholar,  I was there as a knowledgeable adviser on several pending projects. And  as I left both meetings, I realized that the United States might have  already lost the upper hand.
At Fosun International, China’s largest privately owned conglomerate, I was struck by how  expert these talented executives were in investment deal-making and how  little patience they had for my American overconfidence. (I had made  assumptions about a particular proposal we were presenting and how it  would be received.) Their message to me was don’t assume that America’s  reputation will win the day when seeking Chinese investors. Honestly, it  felt like they were schooling me in the ways of capital investment.
Fosun has nothing to apologize for, of  course. It is a star in China’s corporate universe. It has leveraged  China’s economic transformation to become a dynamic force in China in  asset management, investment, pharmaceuticals and steel. No easy feat  considering the four principals started the business in 1992 after  graduating from Fudan University.
During the same trip to China, I visited with executives from the Dalian  Wanda Group Corporation, the Chinese conglomerate with holdings in the  real estate, tourism and entertainment industries. In the United States,  Wanda received the most attention last year when it acquired the  theater chain AMC Entertainment Holdings for $2.6 billion.
At my Wanda meeting, the executives  expressed frustration with how long it takes to develop U.S. real estate  projects, moving them from funding to construction to operations. In  China, the government eliminates many of the hurdles that can block a  project here; in the United States, the government is often the  obstacle.
Again, I felt that the United States had lost its  competitive advantage in the capital investment market. These are shrewd  business people who have a world waiting for their telephone calls.  America won’t secure their support without proving its value with hard  numbers and much homework.
It is not lost on the executives at  Fosun or Wanda—or China, in general, for that matter—how irresponsible  the United States was in managing its own economy in the lead up to the  economic recession, a collapse that went beyond our borders and damaged  national economies worldwide.
Armed with this knowledge, many in China have lost  their respect for the United States and its economic leadership. They  see us as a sluggish super power with bankrupt notions about capital  investment that have more in common with the last century than this one.
That doesn’t mean that our demotion to junior partner is guaranteed. China has a massive number of economic, social  and political problems—from endemic poverty to widespread government  corruption—that could upend its rise to senior partner and global super  power.
And our fortunes aren’t set either. To avoid being  eclipsed, we will need to do more than complain about China’s superior  attitude. We must adopt a more robust form of capital investment and  eliminate the roadblocks that we have put in our way, including our  arrogant assumptions about U.S. economic clout and debilitating  government red tape.
I have learned much from my meetings in  China, and it has prompted me to alter my own thinking and preparations  as I meet with Chinese executives and seek their assistance. I believe  that the United States, much like U.S. business leaders like myself who  have visited China, can change. For the United States to remain the  senior partner and global leader in responsible capital investment, it  will have to do the work necessary to remain on top.
