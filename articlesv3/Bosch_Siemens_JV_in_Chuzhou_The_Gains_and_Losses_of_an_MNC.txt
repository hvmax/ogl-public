### Bosch Siemens’ JV in Chuzhou: The Gains and Losses of an MNC

16 August 2021|China, Economic Development
AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy and, in particular, life in China. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. We have sought to advance a conversation about the U.S.-China relationship, and a deep understanding of local economic development in China. We have been writing about the U.S.-China Trade War as it relates toChinese Innovation;entrepreneurship in China today;anda series aboutChina’s Belt and Road Initiative. More recently, we have focused on thestrategic strength oflocal economic development in China’s 2nd and 3rd tier citiesand a broader analysis of China’s leading cities and clusters of economic development. This post adds to that conversation. – The Editorial Team

Among Chinese cities, the readers of this article may know Nanjing (南京), the capital city of Jiangsu Province, but most readers probably have not heard the name Chuzhou (滁州). In China's home appliance industry, Chuzhou is a known name, because the city hosts the largest manufacturing base of the BSH Home Appliance Corporation (BSH). BSH is one of the leading home appliance companies in the world. In this article we will introduce BSH’s early investment in Chuzhou and discuss its gains and losses of when it first entered the Chinese market.
COVID-19 and the deterioration of U.S.-China relations have not slowed the pace of BSH's investment in China. On May 28, 2021, the BSH China Headquarter officially moved to a 20,000-square-meter building in Nanjing. Eight months before, BSH's largest R&D center worldwide, with a construction area of 40,000 square meters, began operations in the Nanjing Economic and Technological Development Zone. It is located 20 kilometers east of the BSH China headquarters. Meanwhile, in Chuzhou, BSH has been building one project after another: a dishwasher factory In November 2015; a new refrigerator factory in June 2017; and the foundation of a dryer and washing machine factory was laid in 2021. Today, Chuzhou has become the manufacturing center of BSH in China. What has made BSH choose Chuzhou?
At the junction of Jiangsu and Anhui province, west of the Yangtze River Delta, Chuzhou is a prefecture-level city in central China, it has a total area of 13,398 square kilometers and a population of 3,987,054 (1). Chuzhou borders Hefei (合肥), the provincial capital of Anhui to the south and southwest, and Nanjing, the provincial capital of Jiangsu to the southeast.
The start of BSH in Chuzhou was not smooth. In the 1990s, BSH began to implement a going-global strategy. The Chinese market was the focus of its business expansion in Asia. BSH, which had just set foot in the Chinese market, wanted to quickly penetrate into the market through acquisition of local home appliance companies. In 1994, BSH and Wuxi Little Swan Appliance established a joint venture (JV) named BSW to make washing machines. In 1996, BSH and Chuzhou's local state-owned enterprise Yangzi Group (YZ) formed a JV named BSY to make refrigerators. During this period, BSH established its China headquarters in Nanjing, which is less than 2 hours from Wuxi and Chuzhou.
There were two major reasons for BSH to choose Yangzi Group as its JV partner:
First, YZ was one of the few domestic refrigerator giants at that time that intended to sell its refrigerator business and agreed to be controlled by foreign capital. In 1995, YZ had a sales network all over China, and the output of Yangzi brand refrigerators was close to 600,000 units, ranking among the top five in China. Due to its unsuccessful diversification strategy, this state-owned enterprise borrowed a large amount from banks. YZ was embarking on strategic adjustments in an attempt to shrink its business scope. Finally, BSH invested US$82.25 million in cash, and YZ contributed its refrigerator factory’s production land, plant, machinery and equipment, sales network, and other intangible assets (equivalent to US$35.25 million). The two parties established a new refrigerator JV with an estimated annual output of 1.2 million household refrigerators (2). YZ holds 30% of shares in BSY, lower than the 40% of shares held by Chinese shareholders in BSW.
Second, BSH has received strong support from the Chuzhou government. In the mid-1990s, local governments in China only had the right to approve foreign-invested companies with registered capital less than US$30 million. The total investment of the JV between BSH and YZ was as high as US$117.5 million, which was way beyond its approval authority. In addition, due to the sensitivity of a well-known state-owned enterprise being acquired and controlled by foreign capital, if the project were reported to Beijing, it would undoubtedly have caused trouble, additional cost, and extended time. In the end, four JVs were registered at the same time with registered capital not exceeding US$30 million, respectively (2). The four companies uniformly used the name of BSY Refrigeration Co., Ltd. (BSY) in operation. Without the acquiescence and cooperation of the Chuzhou local government, these workarounds would not have happened.
In the five years since the establishment of BSY, the operation of the JV has encountered tremendous difficulties, including conflicts between China and Germany shareholders. BSY not only failed to achieve profitability, but also fell into continued and serious losses. In June 2000, under the arrangements of the YZ’s creditor bank, local government, and the court, YZ transferred all of its equity -- worth US$ 35.25 million -- to BSH at a price of US$9.95 million (2), a shrink of 71.8%. After becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of BSH, BSY was renamed Anhui BSH Refrigeration Co., Ltd (ABSH). Since 2001, ABSH has turned losses into profits, remaining profitable for 20 years. BSH has repeatedly increased its investment in Chuzhou, adding new product categories such as dishwashers, dryers, washing machines, and other products to its traditional refrigerator product line. Now Chuzhou has become the manufacturing center of BSH in China.
The five-year BSY adventure has been part gain and part failure for BSH. From a major shareholder to sole proprietorship, although BSH has finally established a foothold in China, the BSY project is by no means a success.
In the BSY stage, the speed of BSY to enter the Chinese market lags far behind expectations. The factory with an annual production capacity of 1.2 million units only achieved production of less than 340,000 units in the year 2000.As the most important intangible asset of the JV partnership, BSY's so-called nationwide sales network, turned out to be in vain and had no impact at all.The management team of YZ who joined the JV was completely unsuited to the German management style, rules, and regulations. Later, it came to the point where BSY could not operate without reorganizing its management team (2).The shrinking of YZ’s capital at the JV resulted in a total loss of BSY in five years is $84 million.

It is obvious that BSH failed to truly and fully understand the operation and corporate culture of YZ during the due diligence phase, and BSH overestimated the value of YZ's sales network, and underestimated the difficulty of integration after M&A.
In the meantime, we would not say that BSY is useless to BSH:
BSH has found Chuzhou, a low-lying land of manufacturing. Chuzhou has low labor costs, is surrounded by a home appliance industry cluster, and is close to China's core consumer market. Almost 5 years later, Kelon, Midea and Haier, BSH's local competitors in China, realized the value of Anhui Province for home appliance manufacturing and began to build their manufacturing capacity in Hefei province after 2000.BSH has gained a deeper understanding of the role of Chinese local governments like Chuzhou City. BSH has learned to manage the relationship with local governments in a more flexible way. It has realized that a company’s ownership rather than whether an enterprise can provide tax revenue and employment or not, is always more important to the local economy and the performance of local officials. If a foreign company cooperates with the government without violating its ethical standards, it can often get considerable returns, such as preferential policies, support in resolving labor disputes, etc.BSH China has an ideal roadmap for its further development in China. BSH puts the production base in Chuzhou. and BSH's headquarters and R&D center are located 50 kilometers away in Nanjing -- a city where it is easier to attract talent because of the improved quality of life.

In the most competitive and diversified home appliance market in the world, BSH grew 7% in China against the downturn in the economy caused by COVIS-19 in 2020 (3). From increased market share, we can see that BSH's European style and image has gained more favor and its new product categories such as dishwashers and dryers are gradually being accepted by middle-class Chinese consumers. What has most helped BSH to gain a foothold in China is its learning ability, adaptability, and long-term doctrine. We hope that more multinational companies can learn from the gains and losses of BSH in China and discover how to succeed in the Chinese market.
