### Another View on the Third Plenary Session

4 August 2024|China, China politics, Chinese Culture
AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy and, in particular, life in China. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. We have sought to advance a conversation about the U.S.-China relationship, and a deep understanding of local economic development in China. We have written a series about the strategic strength oflocal economic development in China’s 2nd and 3rd tier citiesandentrepreneurship in China today.In our feature, OGL Real Time, we have written previously about the Third Plenary Session of the 20thCPC Central Committee (here). We continue that analysis here, with a discussion of the outcomes of the Third Plenary Session of the 20thCPC Central Committee.
On Thursday, July 18, the Chinese Communist Party released the “Communique of the Third Plenary Session of the 20th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China” (Adopted at the Third Plenary Session of the 20th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on July 18, 2024.) As China’s Foreign Minister, Wang Yi, told U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken on July 27, 2024, “The Third Plenary Session of the 20th Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee (the Plenum) adopted a major resolution on further deepening reform comprehensively to advance Chinese modernization.”
Wang suggested the U.S. side should read this resolution in order to better understand the CPC as well as China’s present and future. Wang’s pointed statement was both directive and somewhat cryptic. Essentially, Wang was saying, “do your homework, read the document… you might learn something…” In aprevious post, we highlighted some of the deeper and more thoughtful phrases and language employed in the Communique.
Since the fourth quarter of 2023, news about the Plenum has been in the spotlight. On the one hand, 10 years after the third plenary session of the 18th CPC Central Committee, which was marked the start of a new journey of comprehensively deepening reform, and China has now reached a new stage of development; on the other hand, the country is facing pressing challenges internally and externally. The desire to understand  solutions to current problems and future developments for the world’s second largest economy is the reason why the Plenum has attracted the attention.
After the meeting, Xinhua News Agency released three documents in full, i.e.,Communiqué of the Third Plenary Session of the 20thCentral Committee of the Communist Party of China(the Communiqué),Resolution of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Further Deepening Reform Comprehensively to Advance Chinese Modernization(the Resolution) andExplanation of the Resolution of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Further Deepening Reform Comprehensively to Advance Chinese Modernization(the Explanation). In this piece, we will make some interpretations of the Plenum based on these three documents.
The Communiqué described the situation facing the CPC at the time of the Plenum as follows: the complex developments both at home and abroad; the new round of scientific and technological revolution and industrial transformation; the new expectations of the Chinese people. It uses “grave and complex” when describing the international environment separately.
Such sequence and description indicate that CPC is seriously preparing for the likely further deterioration of China-US relations and its negative impacts, especially the fact that Donald Trump may return to the White House after the election in November.
As we predicted in ourprevious post, the new reform panorama painted by the Plenum does not have initiatives or concepts beyond expectation. The 20th National Congress of CPC in 2022 set out a strategic plan for China to realize the Second Centenary Goal (1) around 2049, and the reform measures of the Plenum are formulated in accordance with the requirements to achieve these strategic goals.
Before the Plenum, the party’s top leaders have already unveiled reform ideas at Politburo meetings or symposiums, and the documents released after the Plenum basically follow these directions.Overall, the Plenum has sent out important messages, especially in the Resolution, which is a to-do list of how to implement strategic deployments from now to 2029.
What to Reform and How to Reform
The adoption of a reform resolution is the most important outcome of the Plenum. The main body of the Resolution consists of 15 sections and 60 subsections. Sections two through fifteen make up parts that elaborate actions, more than 300 reform measures are included in subsections. The Resolution requests that these reform tasks must be completed by the time the People’s Republic of China celebrates its 80th anniversary in 2029.
The table below (Figure 2), which includes the title of all sections and subsections, demonstrates the framework of the Resolution. Structural economic reform remains a priority in further deepening reform as 6 of 15 sections are about this important topic. When putting titles together, the goal of a specific reform section and the related action items become clear. For example, after rephrasing, Section II now reads:
In order tobuild a high-standard socialist market economy,we shouldupholdand fulfill the commitments to the public and non-public sectors,build a unified national marketandrefine the systems underpinning the market economy.
There is also some implicit information embedded in the titles. Another example, how to understand “high-standard” mentioned above? The answer is: the subsection titles and the measures within each subsection are necessary conditions to become “high-standard.” A unified national market cannot be built without unified underlying institutions and rules of the market, impartial and unified market regulation, and high level connectivity between market facilities. Following the same logic, a socialist market economy without a unified national market is not a high-standard one.
Lift Restrictions on the Market while Ensuring Effective Regulation (2)
While the economic structural reform is given leading role in the Resolution, balancing the relationship between the government and the market remains the most critical issue to improve. The Resolution points out that “We must better leverage the role of the market, foster a fairer and more dynamic market environment, and make resource allocation as efficient and productive as possible. We need to lift restrictions on the market while ensuring effective regulation and strive to better maintain order in the market and remedy market failures.” Such formulation has modified the wording in the Resolution of the third plenary session of the 18th CPC Central Committee in 2013: “we should let the market play the decisive role in allocating resources and let the government play its functions better.” Lift restrictions on the market while ensuring effective regulation; what is the logic behind this apparent contradiction? The answer, in our view, is that there is not a contradiction here, but rather, the articulation of a healthy balance between regulation and market freedom.
The Resolution aims at solving the major dilemmas and problems challenging China’s development. In the past several years, how to tackle prominent problems facing private enterprises, stabilize their expectations and boost their confidence have been topics of common concern. The purpose of “Lifting Restrictions” aims to support the development of the non-public sector and stimulate its dynamism and creativity. From the text, the idea of the next step of reform is to foster a favorable environment and create more opportunities for the non-public sector, including:
Formulate a private sector promotion law.Remove barriers to market access, open the competitive areas of infrastructure to all market entities, and improve the long-term mechanism that allows private enterprises to participate in major national projects.Support private enterprises in leading national initiatives in major technologies and provide private enterprises with greater access to major national scientific research infrastructure.Improve the legal framework for the long-term regulation of charges levied on enterprises and for clearing overdue payments owed to them.Move faster to set up a system for comprehensively evaluating private enterprises’ credit status and refine the credit enhancement system for small and medium private enterprises.
• Formulate a private sector promotion law.
• Remove barriers to market access, open the competitive areas of infrastructure to all market entities, and improve the long-term mechanism that allows private enterprises to participate in major national projects.
• Support private enterprises in leading national initiatives in major technologies and provide private enterprises with greater access to major national scientific research infrastructure.
• Improve the legal framework for the long-term regulation of charges levied on enterprises and for clearing overdue payments owed to them.
• Move faster to set up a system for comprehensively evaluating private enterprises’ credit status and refine the credit enhancement system for small and medium private enterprises.
Compared to “Lifting Restrictions,” “Ensuring Effective Regulation” requires higher quality of governance. Since 2013, governments at different levels have reduced the restrictions on enterprises in administrative work such as examination and approval, company registration, etc. However, these efforts have somehow been offset by the perception that the targets of regulation are limited to the non-public sector. The rectification of internet platform companies like Alibaba carried out on the grounds of anti-monopoly and anti-unfair competition or the sudden banning of the education and training industry, and the recent tax re-investigation for records more than ten years ago in some places, while plausible, the impacts have shaken the confidence of private entrepreneurs. Yes, the government has a role to play when markets fail, but how to judge market failure and in what approach to intervention are subjective considerations and rely on the discretion of officials. Now that the Resolution has responded to concerns from the private sector, it remains to be seen when these reform measures will be implemented and how effective they will be.
Distant Water and Present Thirst
Compared with the problems of China’s economy pointed out by foreign media, such as housing bubbles, local debts, insufficient domestic demand, overcapacity, youth unemployment, and moving manufacturing out of China, etc., the problem description in the Explanation seems closer to root cause analysis:
“At present, unbalanced and inadequate development remains a pronounced problem in promoting China’s high-quality development. For example, the market system still needs improvement; the market itself is not adequately developed; the relationship between the government and the market needs to be further straightened out; our innovation capacity falls short of the requirements for high-quality development; the industrial system, while large in size and extensive in scope, is not yet strong or sophisticated enough; the over-reliance on key and core technologies controlled by others has not been fundamentally changed; the foundations of agriculture need to be further strengthened; wide gaps persist in development and income distribution between urban and rural areas and between regions; and weak links remain in improving the people’s wellbeing and protecting the ecological environment.”
Some foreign media have described the Plenum as bland, because they have not seen an eye-catching new formulation or solution to get China’s economy out of its “predicament.” They see the Plenum as distant water that cannot quench present thirst. These people don’t understand the different messages conveyed by the three documents. The Communiqué covers the entirety of the Plenum, from which we see the theme of the meeting was to further deepen reform comprehensively, the Plenum also analyzed the present situation and tasks, as well as personnel arrangements, such as accepting the resignation of Qin Gang, the former Foreign Minister, and removing his position on the Central Committee (4). The Resolution and the Explanation center on strategic reform and foreground the new measures, leaving out general and repetitive measures and operational measures to routine operations.
To follow up the call made in the Communiqué to “remain firmly committed to accomplishing the goals for this year’s economic and social development,” on July 30, 2024, the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee held a meeting to analyze the current economic situation and set out priorities for the second half of 2024. The meeting requested reform measures that are ready, tangible and attainable be adopted in a timely manner and more policies to boost domestic consumption. On the real estate sector, the meeting urged active support for the purchase of commodity housing inventory to be used as affordable housing and efforts to ensure the delivery of housing projects. While calling for cultivating more emerging industries and future-oriented industries, the meeting warned industries to strengthen self-discipline to prevent NEIJUAN (5) and irrational competition. It is foreseeable that ministries and commissions of the State Council and local governments will soon introduce some concrete measures in response to the Politburo meeting.
There is a statement in the Explanation: “Advancing Chinese modernization is a whole new endeavor. On the journey ahead, we will inevitably be confronted with problems, risks, and challenges. In particular, momentous changes of a magnitude not seen in a century are accelerating across the world, regional conflicts and disturbances keep cropping up, global issues are becoming more acute, and external attempts to suppress and contain China are escalating. China has entered a period in which strategic opportunities, risks, and challenges coexist and uncertainties and unpredictability are rising. Various “black swan” and “gray rhino” events have the potential to occur at any time. To effectively deal with these risks and challenges and seize the strategic initiative amid intensifying international competition, we need to further deepen reform comprehensively, so that we can create sound institutions to prevent and defuse risks and respond to challenges, strive to foster new opportunities amid crises, and break new ground amid the changing landscape”. Perhaps this is the message that Foreign Minister Wang Yi wanted Secretary Blinken to read and understand.

1.  First proposed in 1997, the two centenary goals of China’s development are:
The first centenary goal - to build a moderately prosperous society by the centenary of the CPC (founded in 1921).The second centenary goal - to build a great modern socialist country by the centenary of the People’s Republic of China (founded in 1949)

2.  “Lift Restrictions on the Market while Ensuring Effective Regulation” is the translation of “放得活”又”管得住” in Chinese.
3.  The subtitle comes from a Chinese idiom “远水解不了近渴”, translated as “distant water cannot quench present thirst”.
4.  Qin Gang is still called “comrade” in The Communiqué.
5.  Neijuan (内卷), often translated as “involution”, matches Western ideas of the rat race.
