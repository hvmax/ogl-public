AtOn Global Leadership, we value the insights of our colleagues in China and the personal reflections they have shared with us and you during the coronavirus pandemic. As China has reopened in the wake of the pandemic, the final sign of the return to normalcy has been students and children returning to school. Two of our colleagues have written about this experience as their children have returned to kindergarten and high school, with the appropriate safety precautions.

Over the past month, the coronavirus management systems across China have been tested as students of all ages returned to school. June 2 turned out to be a red letter day in Shanghai. The most vulnerable members of our population were now being launched into the public. Primary grades, first through third, as well as kindergartens and nursery schools were all opened. If traffic was any measure, the parents also headed back to offices as well. Other cities like Beijing and Wuhan are actually behind by a week with kindergartens expected to start back June 8.
Shanghai started this process more than a month ago as students in Grades 9 through 12 were the first cohort to return to school. On April 27, our son headed to the car with his school bag loaded with textbooks. Who knew when the winter holidays began back in early January it would be 14 weeks before he would return to the classroom?  Since February 17, he and his classmates have been attending online school, and the school administration  planned for weeks to establish procedures for managing the reentry process.
For us, this journey first began on December 31, 2019, when we learned that China's version of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control had sent a team to investigate an unusual type of pneumonia in the city of Wuhan in Hubei province. By January 7, the U.S. Consulate in Wuhan and the U.S. Embassy in Beijing issued travel notices to Americans to pay attention to this pneumonia outbreak. On January 21, China’s government issued a statement naming the pneumonia “ 2019-nCoV” and confirmed human-to-human spread. As a society, we knew what to do because we’d been here before with SARS in 2003. Our sons were amused that we could pull a box of N95 masks from the closet, leftovers from long ago.
That announcement came at the start of the annual Chinese New Year. Offices were already closed, and students from university to kindergarten had been at home for two or more weeks. We learned to live with masks and gloves again for carefully planned excursions for essential tasks, and the holidays were extended for several weeks.
February 23 saw China’s first baby steps to reengage the economy. While those who could continued to work from home, others started making their way back to factories. This reverse migration would involve some 288 million people on trains, planes, and buses. Road blocks were established at provincial borders to check temperatures, with U-turn lanes available for those who did not have actual jobs waiting for them or for those who exhibited symptoms. Step by step, each week one could observe a different slice of the economy coming alive. And each time we all held our collective breath knowing that new outbreaks would result in a sharp reversal.

Nothing was watched with more concern than the return to the classroom of China’s 276 million school-age students. Each province and major city reopened at different times, depending on the particular situation for that region. Any major metropolis with an international airport could not reopen quickly, as the number of imported coronavirus cases continued to flow in.
Finally, it was Shanghai’s turn to take the plunge. Dutifully packed in their book bags, students had three face masks: one for the morning session, one for the afternoon session, and an extra one, just in case. Adding to the excitement, the night before saw a flurry of last-minute emails from an obviously nervous teacher. For example, she asked if the student had registered online for the latest health QR code? Could students come early to avoid a crowd arriving at the same time? Had parents instructed children on social-distancing practices? Lunch time was going to be particularly difficult. Exactly how does one eat with a face mask on?
The project turned out to be an all-hands-on-deck community effort; all departments of the city government were engaged; and a task force was established for each school, with representation from the Bureau of Education along with community health centers, police, and the neighborhood committee. From public schools to international private schools, the physical set-up was remarkably similar. Infrared cameras were placed at the front gates to efficiently track temperatures as the students streamed by. A special room or tent was set up to isolate a child who was found to have a fever during the health checks, which occurred throughout the day. If students, staff, or faculty members tested positive for a fever, they were isolated. No one would be welcomed back until they presented a certificate from the relevant hospital confirming all is well.
And the quality and expense of security measures does vary. At our son’s high school, a simple infrared camera on a tripod amounted to security, a much lower investment than the kindergarten where they had installed the top-of-the-line HIKVISION, which the principle claimed had been required by the local authorities and cost RMB40,000 (USD5700).
At the gate, kindergarten children remove their masks. It has been decided that it’s not healthy for young ones to wear masks all day because its patently impossible to control this age group. Teachers and administrators will wear them, however. The security guard explained that if the child is found to have a fever, the information will be sent immediately—via online connection—to the local health bureau. The parent or guardian will be asked to take the child to the local hospital. When we asked how the system will know the child’s name, he excitedly explained, “facial recognition, of course.” All the students were digitized in the system as a normal procedure. Right!
Additionally, each family is responsible for submitting an online report, which is connected to the parent’s health QR code. This report includes the child’s temperature that must be taken before we leave the house and includes information on family members’ travel outside of Shanghai. Depending on the situation at the destination country, upon return to Shanghai, the entire family may have to go into 14 days of isolation. Beijing followed Shanghai in returning little ones to school, with Wuhan right behind.
As our four-year-old went happily through the school gate, submitting to social distancing and temperature checks, all the parents, our faces wrapped in masks, were feeling the same thing. It had been four months since our world had changed due to COVID. We have been burdened by the responsibility of ensuring that our families didn’t reintroduce the virus to our community. There is still much work to be done: churches, sports stadiums, and cinemas are yet to be opened. But right now, at this very moment, we can happily start the day. Our collective discipline demonstrated success at keeping the invisible enemy at bay.
