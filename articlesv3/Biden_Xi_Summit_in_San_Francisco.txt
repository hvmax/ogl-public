AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy and, in particular, life in China. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. We have written about economic development in China and China’s economic reforms, US-China relations, China’s changing role in the global political economy, and the history and current state of Chinese politics.In this post, we examine U.S.-China relations in the context of Chinese President Xi Jinping’s visit to San Francisco for the annual Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) meeting. He met there with President Joe Biden. Following ourOGL Real Time predictions leading up to the summit, in this post, we deliver an assessment of what occurred.
On November 15, at Filoli Estate, south of San Francisco, U.S. President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping held a summit meeting. It was the presidents’ first face-to-face meeting in a year, the last meeting being held in Bali at the G20 meeting. The summit meeting, which lasted about four hours, included an expanded bilateral meeting and a working lunch, and was followed by a dinner with a high-level group of American business leaders.
In earlier posts, we have pointed to the important changes shaping U.S.-China relations this year and likely for years to come, including. China’s changing role in the world and the ways in which this changing role will demand a return to engagement and partnership with China by the United States. The summit discussions gave the world a strong sense of just how much these two nations will be collaborating in the decade to come.
How can we best understand and learn from the discussion between the leaders of the world’s two largest economies?
Biden described the meeting as, “One of the most constructive and productive that statesmen conducted together.” China’s official readout used the words “positive, comprehensive, and constructive” to describe the meeting. Chinese Foreign Minister, Wang Yi, said it was “a very good, comprehensive, and in-depth meeting.” It is clear that both countries see the summit as a successful event.
In the lead up to the summit, as host country, the United States was thoughtful about preparations and conducted meticulous arrangements for the summit:
Biden invited Xi for a standalone meeting, such an offer conveyed a message that the summit was not an “accompanying bilateral event” of the APEC meeting, but rather a separate, formal event with high significance.Filoli Estate, a quiet place with a beautiful mansion and lush gardens in the heart of Silicon Valley, was chosen as the venue of the summit. Security measures were strict everywhere the Chinese leader went.Xi was warmly received by Biden. The two heads of state shook hands and took photos on a carpeted walkway, with flags of both countries flying, and in the presence of honor guards from the U.S. Marine Corps. The two presidents went for a walk on the estate, and Biden escorted Xi to his limousine to bid farewell.

As the United States enters a contentious election year, a period when the relationship is likely to face greater scrutiny and perhaps greater uncertainty, both presidents were willing to seize the window to stabilize the relationship. The summit was preceded by a series of working consultations between the two countries in areas such as climate, economy and trade, foreign policy, maritime affairs, and even arms control. Inasmuch as both sides sought to manage expectations by expressing demands ahead of the summit, participants and pundits were not expecting any major breakthroughs. So, when the outcomes of the meeting were published, there were no surprises. What the U.S. got is some tangible results that can be seen in the short term, while China's approach and aspirations seemed more strategic and oriented toward the longer term.
The U.S. side was able to announce some key deliverables that they desired, especially the first two:
China agreed to cooperate with the U.S. on cutting the flow of precursor chemicals for fentanyl and counternarcotics.Both leaders agreed to reestablish military-to-military communications at different levels.The leaders discussed artificial intelligence and agreed to launch bilateral talks on risks and safety related to AI.The leaders agreed to jointly promote people-to-people exchanges by increasing scheduled direct flights, advancing cooperation, expanding subnational exchanges, and strengthening cooperation in tourism education and disability affairs.

The Chinese side wanted to set the direction and the way for the two countries to get along going forward. The Chinese valued the commitment on major issues of concern to China from the United States:
Biden noted that he has always believed that the U.S.-China relationship is the most important bilateral relationship in the world. Conflict between the two countries is not inevitable.A stable and growing China is good for the United States and the whole world. When the Chinese economy grows, it benefits the United States and other countries.When the United States and China keep their relations stable, prevent conflict, manage differences, and cooperate in areas of shared interest, they will be better able to handle the issues facing themselves and common challenges.Biden reaffirmed the five commitments he made in Bali, i.e., the United States does not seek a new Cold War, does not seek to change China’s system, does not seek to revitalize its alliances against China, does not support “Taiwan independence”, and has no intention of having a conflict with China.

Held at a time when the U.S.-China relationship is at a critical stage, the summit meeting has reached significant consensus, made realistic progress, and has played a role in stabilizing the bilateral relationship. The U.S.-China relationship is too important to be left balanced, and the summit meeting is an effective control measure for the relationship. As an opportunity to continue resetting a tone of engagement between the world’s two largest economies, the meeting and its outcomes were positive. The four-hour meeting used simultaneous interpretation and greatly increased the effective time for discussion.
From the information released publicly, through readouts or interviews, what was new and perhaps striking about this meeting?
China’s remarks on the Taiwan issue deserves special attention: “China will realize reunification, and this is unstoppable” (1). The Taiwan question remains the most important and most sensitive issue between China and the U.S. In recent years, the Chinese Government's strategy toward Taiwan has shifted from preventing Taiwan’s independence to realizing national reunification. As long as the One-China Principle is respected, the mainland is willing to seek national reunification by peaceful means. Since reunification is viewed as unstoppable, if there is no hope for peaceful reunification, military means will inevitably be put on the table. However, we do not think reunification is the goal of the mainland in the short to medium term (until 2035).
During the meeting, in addition to urging the U.S. to honor the One-China Principle, China's list of demands from the United States included: oppose “Taiwan independence,” “stop arming Taiwan, stop interfering in China’s internal affairs, and support China’s peaceful reunification”. The U.S. side recognizes the first two demands are necessary to establish a guardrail against a military conflict but has not accepted the last three. There are still huge differences between the two sides on the question of China’s reunification.
As no joint statement was issued at the summit, each party expressed their views in respective readouts. Principles guiding the bilateral relations are among the key common understandings coming out of the meeting. While wording was the same, one can still tell the difference in area of focus and on the sequence of these principles.
United States:Responsibly managing competitive aspects of the relationship, preventing conflict, maintaining open lines of communication, cooperating on areas of shared interest, upholding the UN Charter, and all countries treating each other with respect and finding a way to live alongside each other peacefully.
China:All countries treating each other with respect and finding a way to live alongside each other peacefully, and of maintaining open lines of communication, preventing conflict, upholding the UN Charter, cooperating in areas of shared interest, and responsibly managing competitive aspects of the relationship.
After the summit meeting, Xi attended a welcome dinner hosted by five friendly organizations in the U.S. Nearly 400 business leaders – including Apple CEO Tim Cook, Blackstone CEO Stephen Schwarzman, founder of Bridgewater Ray Dalio, and leaders from Pfizer, FedEx, Boeing and KKR -- attended the banquet with government officials and academics. Xi delivered a speech entitled “Galvanizing Our Peoples into a Strong Force for the Cause of China-U.S. Friendship.” Despite a standing ovation, some on social media have expressed disappointment with the speech, arguing there was no concrete solution to the plight of foreign companies doing business in China.
What are OGL’s views on this issue?
We disagree for the following reasons. From the title of the speech, we can tell the target audience is the American people. The Chinese leader hopes to use the event to convey messages to the American people: China thinks highly of the friendship between the two countries, how China views China-U.S. relations, how the Communist Party of China (CPC) governs the country, and China’s development goals, etc. Among them the most important message is:
“… the number one question for us is: are we adversaries or partners? This is the fundamental and overarching issue. The logic is quite simple. If one sees the other side as a primary competitor, the most consequential geopolitical challenge, and a pacing threat, it will only lead to misinformed policy making, misguided actions, and unwanted results. China is ready to be a partner and friend of the United States.”
Xi reiterated China’s attitude as well. China is willing to be a partner and friend of the United States, showing a friendly and open attitude. The Chinese market welcomes American companies and investment. Has the U.S. business community gotten these messages? The fact that so many American business leaders attended the dinner was an indication that China remains an attractive market and investment destination.
Of course, the overall unfriendly public view of China in recent years and its three-year isolation caused by Covid-19 has indeed made many U.S. companies that want do business in China suspicious. In his written speech at the APEC CEO Summit the next day, Xi devoted more space to talking about the current Chinese economy, its achievements and challenges, and responses to some specific concerns, noting, for example, the importance of “improving the policies on entry and stay of foreign nationals in China and removing for them choke points in financial, medical, e-payment and other services.”
Expecting a response to specific questions is not appropriate for an occasion like the welcome dinner. Doing business in China requires a deep understanding of China, and that’s exactly why the American business leaders attended the event.
After the summit, how will U.S.-China relations evolve?
Before the summit meeting, some scholars in China used détente instead of improvement, voicing mostly caution and little optimism to describe U.S.-China relations after Secretary of State Blinken’s visit to China in June. The summit may have reversed that thinking.
One of the things that the United States and China have been doing for so many years is finding a basis for cooperation between the two countries. From Bali to San Francisco, the bottom line for both sides should be clear, that is, to avoid a military conflict. San Francisco is a new starting point, whether the road ahead is smooth or not lies in the implementation of the consensus reached and the progress of the working-level consultations between the two countries.
The year 2024 features a significant and contentious U.S. presidential election. Considering the damage done to relations between the two countries during the Trump administration and considering that several of the candidates of the Republican Party are articulating extreme anti-China views, Beijing is willing to deal with Biden and the Democratic Party. This can be clearly seen from this past summit meeting. However, there are some structural disagreements in the relationship so even if Biden is re-elected, there will be no “substantial improvement” in U.S.-China relations, a reality that must be recognized and accepted for now.
For American companies that want to pursue business opportunities in China, the world’s second largest economy is a high-beta market. Beijing would be happy to see more American companies succeed in China, more than the likes of Tesla, Apple, Disney, and Starbucks. Beijing stands ready to continue to welcome American companies to manufacture and produce products in China and also to view China as a sophisticated consumer market worthy of their attentions.
