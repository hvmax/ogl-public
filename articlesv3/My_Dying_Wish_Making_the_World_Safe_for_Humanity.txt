By Dr. Mark Goulston
Six months ago, as I stared into the abyss of what I thought was my imminent demise due to a grim upcoming Acute Myeloid Leukemia diagnosis and poor prognosis at the age of 75, my dying wish weighed heavily on me. I pondered, what could a man like me - not a social media influencer, not a political powerhouse, and entirely forgettable - leave behind that could truly make a difference?
I was searching for something implementable that could resonate across humankind, outlive me, and maybe, just maybe, touch every corner of this fractious, incendiary world, beginning with America and growing organically and then globally. I found my answer in a simple, yet profound concept: #SVYC - Safely Vote Your Conscience.
The principle is basic, yet revolutionary. Imagine if every politician, regardless of party affiliation, could cast their vote in secret. A vote guided purely by their conscience, unswayed by the cacophony of external pressures, unmarred by the threat of political retribution and loss of their job, and unbound by the chains of partisan expectations. This secret ballot, which we hold sacred for every citizen, should extend to the halls of power.
Under #SVYC, every decision-maker would stand in the voting booth - metaphorically speaking - shielded from prying eyes, able to act on what is right versus what is wrong, what is good versus evil, what truly serves the best interest of the entire constituency they represent vs. sticking to party lines. And finally as Americans, leaders of the free world. BTW this is not an exceptionalism boast, but a burden of global responsibility that requires our utmost commitment.
As I stand on the precipice of hope, awaiting a bone marrow transplant that may extend my time on this troubled yet still beautiful planet, my optimism for personal survival is matched by my deep concern for our collective survival.
I propose a bold and daring experiment, starting in America, where we could set a precedent for democracy that could reverberate globally.
To achieve this, I've dared to dream of the ideal candidates who would embody the #SVYC spirit.
I imagine a ticket led by Mitt Romney on the Republican side, a man of demonstrated principle andReckoning,who decided not to campaign for re-election in 2024 (not only because he would likely not win as Trump would have us believe, but because of his shame for what his party and he have become). And for his running mate, Liz Cheney, who has shown a steadfast commitment to truth against tides of opposition at the cost of her job.
For Independents and Democrats, I envision commentator Michael Steele, a former Republican National Committee Chair, whose clear-eyed analysis and dedication to the larger good define his public persona, with Jamie Raskin, a man of integrity, who I believe would also serve admirably, acknowledging that we must fight against the darkness of anti-Semitism that unfortunately still plagues our society and beyond that, the world. His dedication to democracy and the Rule of Law doesn’t make up for the death by suicide of his son, Tommy, but has given him a purpose to go on.
Why these individuals? Because they exhibit traits that transcend their political identities - integrity, courage, and a palpable sense of duty to the larger good. Furthermore they are people we can trust, have confidence in, respect and admire, which exemplify unicorn leaders of the future we need. These are the qualities that should define people that just might create a world safe for humanity.
#SVYC is not just a campaign for the collective American conscience; it is a campaign for the human spirit. In a world rife with division, the ability to vote one's conscience without fear is the cornerstone of a truly free society and world.
As I confront the uncertainties of my health, I hold onto the belief that even as a single voice, this message can resonate, inspire, and ignite a movement that will ensure that long after I am gone, the world can indeed become a safe place for all of humanity.
As I embark on this next phase of my journey, with the hope that modern medicine grants me, I call upon every person who yearns for a world governed by right over wrong and good over evil, to embrace #SVYC. Let us together create a legacy that safeguards our shared humanity, making it flourish for generations to come and safe for the children and grandchildren that we adore.
