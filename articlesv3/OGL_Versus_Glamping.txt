AtOn Global Leadership, we seek to provide a variety of analyses about leadership in the global economy and, in particular, life in China. Our lens is always a mixture of political economic analysis combined with boots-on-the-ground experience. We have sought to advance a conversation about the U.S.-China relationship, and a deep understanding of local economic development in China. OGL Versus, our latest feature, allows us to write briefly about the interesting competition between the U.S. and China, and offer some additional readings to take this conversation to even deeper levels. In our latest post, we briefly discuss the phenomenon of glamorous camping or glamping.
Gone are the days of leaky tents, sleeping on tree roots, and bugs everywhere. Instead, glamping, or glamorous camping, offers luxury outdoor experiences in recent years -- both in China and in the United States. However, there are notable differences due to cultural, geographical, and environmental factors.
Present-day glamping has its origins in the early 1900s when wealthy European and American travelers went to Africa for safaris and hunting expeditions. While shooting parties might have been willing to wander the muddy savannahs for game, they wanted to come home every night to well-equipped tents with champagne, folding bathtubs, and electric generators.
Today, glamping is part adventure, part luxury, and part eco-friendly mission for many travelers in the United States and China. Both nations are exploring the breadth of options available for campers who are willing to pay for a more posh experience.
Glamping in China often incorporates elements of traditional Chinese culture. For example, some glamping sites feature architecture and decor inspired by ancient Chinese styles, such as pagodas, tea ceremonies, and hot springs. Additionally, there may be a greater emphasis on feng shui in the layout and harmony of the structure or site.
Glamping locations in China are often found in scenic areas near national parks, ancient cultural landmarks, and mountain regions such as the Yunnan Province, Zhangjiajie, or around the Yangtze River. Many sites emphasize views of iconic landscapes like bamboo forests or terraced rice fields, often near cultural heritage sites.
The government estimates that by 2025, the core camping market in China will grow to 248.32 billion yuan ($35.05 billion), and will create a total market size of 1.44 trillion yuan, according to the People’s Daily.
The glamping experience in China includes luxury yurts, bamboo cabins, and eco-friendly tents with a focus on harmony with the natural surroundings. The accommodations often emphasize privacy and serenity, with wellness activities like tai chi or traditional Chinese medicine integrated into the experience.
China’s glamping is frequently tied to wellness and cultural experiences, such as tea tasting, calligraphy classes, or meditation sessions. The proximity to historical and cultural sites often allows guests to engage with ancient Chinese traditions.
Glamping is a newer concept in China, but it’s rapidly growing in popularity, particularly among urbanites looking for luxury retreats outside of major cities like Beijing and Shanghai. The market is still maturing, with a focus on eco-tourism and luxury.
United StatesIn contrast, U.S. glamping tends to emphasize nature-based themes like wilderness exploration, ranch-style living, or coastal retreats. The design of accommodations often blends rustic elements with modern amenities, reflecting the diverse landscapes such as mountains, forests, deserts, and lakes.
In the U.S., glamping sites are widespread across various terrains, including national parks like Yellowstone, coastal areas like California, or desert regions such as Utah and Arizona. U.S. glamping tends to focus on proximity to outdoor activities like hiking, kayaking, and wildlife viewing. The U.S. glamping market is forecast to grow from $561.42 million in 2023, to reach $1.30 billion in 2029, at a CAGR of 15.14% from 2023 to 2029.
Glamping often includes safari-style tents, airstream trailers, treehouses, and domes, with a focus on modern comforts such as high-end bedding, climate control, and gourmet kitchens. There’s typically a broader range of styles and themes, from minimalist to more lavish setups.
In the U.S., glamping activities usually revolve around outdoor adventure, like horseback riding, stargazing, and national park tours. It tends to appeal more to adventure seekers looking to balance comfort with exploration of the natural world.
The U.S. has a more established glamping market, with a wide range of options available across many states. Glamping is seen as an extension of the U.S.’s strong camping culture but with an upscale twist, attracting both domestic travelers and international tourists.
In both countries, glamping offers a balance between luxury and nature and experiential travel, but the glamping experience is shaped by cultural preferences, regional landscapes, and the integration of local traditions.Additional Reading - U.S.
